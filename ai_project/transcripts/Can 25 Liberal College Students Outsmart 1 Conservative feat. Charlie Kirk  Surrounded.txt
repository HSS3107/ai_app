Transcript:

[00:00:00] do you think men can give birth I think
[00:00:01] that uh yes or no question I think that
[00:00:04] a person who is assigned male at Birth I
[00:00:06] don't think they a signed male at Birth
[00:00:07] so people are not male at Birth I think
[00:00:09] that a person see your evidence that
[00:00:10] college is a scam my friend so what do
[00:00:12] you say in some cases women without your
[00:00:13] these are murderers of course not
[00:00:14] they're not murderers we the difference
[00:00:16] between an IUD killing a conceived
[00:00:17] zygote and like a mother going to
[00:00:19] Planned Parenthood and killing the petus
[00:00:20] in her room that was actually the best
[00:00:22] point somebody made it's not about the
[00:00:24] the cells it's not about no no no I'm
[00:00:26] speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking
[00:00:28] no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm
[00:00:30] speaking no I'm speaking hello everyone
[00:00:32] I am Charlie Kirk founder of Turning
[00:00:34] Point USA and uh I am surrounded by 20
[00:00:37] woke college
[00:00:41] kids my first prompt is abortion is
[00:00:44] murder and should be
[00:00:51] [Music]
[00:00:57] illegal all right can I maybe go
[00:01:02] okay hello what's your name Juliana nice
[00:01:04] to meet you nice to meet you can we get
[00:01:05] our terms right first yeah okay abortion
[00:01:07] is the forcible ending of the viability
[00:01:10] of a being in utero otherwise known as a
[00:01:12] fetus do we agree that's what abortion
[00:01:14] is okay yeah okay great and then murder
[00:01:18] is the intentional taking of Life
[00:01:19] different than killing or sudden death
[00:01:21] so murder would be the intent with
[00:01:23] intent taking another life do we agree
[00:01:25] with that okay okay and then we agree
[00:01:27] that murder in general in society should
[00:01:29] be illegal yeah okay great so yeah no I
[00:01:31] do want to preface that I'm a Catholic
[00:01:33] so I think one really important thing
[00:01:35] that the Bible says is to not judge and
[00:01:38] just going back to the topic um I think
[00:01:41] there's a big difference uh between you
[00:01:43] know cells in utero than a living
[00:01:46] breathing existing being and while um I
[00:01:50] do believe it's murder and that's just
[00:01:52] my personal belief right I don't believe
[00:01:54] in telling people what to do with their
[00:01:56] bodies that's not up to me and it's not
[00:01:59] up to us as well as Christians to judge
[00:02:02] should we prevent murder in society for
[00:02:04] sure yeah I should be illegal but I
[00:02:07] think that it's really different right
[00:02:08] because you know these people
[00:02:13] aren't sorry nice to meet you okay nice
[00:02:15] to
[00:02:19] [Music]
[00:02:23] meet okay what's your name NAA nice to
[00:02:25] meet you okay can I just ask um at how
[00:02:28] many weeks do you think that a fetus is
[00:02:29] V viable well viability and moral worth
[00:02:32] are two different things no but I'm
[00:02:34] asking you at how many weeks do you 20
[00:02:36] weeks a baby can survive outside of
[00:02:38] utero so it's actually 24 to 26 weeks 20
[00:02:41] the youngest ever in a niku unit
[00:02:42] actually happened in San Diego not far
[00:02:43] from here and Sur survived at 20 weeks
[00:02:46] okay so under roie Wade 93% of abortions
[00:02:49] happened in the first 13 weeks of
[00:02:51] pregnancy that's 93% of the abortions
[00:02:54] happened well before a fetus is
[00:02:56] technically viable as a form of let's go
[00:02:59] into VI ability so what is it about
[00:03:01] let's say a six week baby that has a
[00:03:04] heartbeat its own DNA fingerprint brain
[00:03:07] waves that is less moral worth than an
[00:03:09] 88-year-old right now with dementia in a
[00:03:11] home down the street that person
[00:03:13] requires assistance requires help what
[00:03:16] why is it that the six week baby is of
[00:03:18] less moral worth well first of all it's
[00:03:19] not a baby it's a fetus what does fetus
[00:03:21] mean a fetus is in utero what does fetus
[00:03:25] mean in Latin what the I'm sorry is this
[00:03:27] a it means little human being
[00:03:31] his smile is very creepy okay um smiling
[00:03:34] is creepy no your smile specifically but
[00:03:36] let's go back to we're losing track here
[00:03:39] no but but is what species is the fetus
[00:03:42] the fetus is not a species yet it's
[00:03:44] technically classified as a parasite
[00:03:47] until it is viable now I want to talk I
[00:03:49] can't really get past that are you
[00:03:50] saying you saying a baby is a disease or
[00:03:52] a tumor a parasite is not a disease and
[00:03:54] a tumor those are not the same thing a
[00:03:56] parasite is defined as something that
[00:03:58] cannot survive outside its host a baby
[00:04:02] before it is viable cannot survive
[00:04:05] outside of a woman's womb got it so
[00:04:07] let's let's extrapolate that is not a
[00:04:09] living organism are are old people with
[00:04:11] Alzheimer's and Dementia that are being
[00:04:13] assisted every day are they parasites no
[00:04:16] they're not parasites they're human
[00:04:17] beings who are on the brink of death got
[00:04:19] it so my going my four-month-old that
[00:04:22] requires mom's breast milk and requires
[00:04:24] daily changes and feedings cannot
[00:04:26] survive without its own is my
[00:04:28] four-month-old the parasite your baby
[00:04:30] can breathe on its own your baby can
[00:04:31] drink water from its mouth to its
[00:04:34] stomach but but it canot your bab can
[00:04:35] eat can it hunt can it gather can it
[00:04:38] reason but that's not what qualifies
[00:04:40] something as being a living organism
[00:04:42] being a living organism simply means can
[00:04:44] you survive outside of a womb outside of
[00:04:49] your host got it so I just want to make
[00:04:50] sure I'm clear why does that then equate
[00:04:53] to moral viability it equates to
[00:04:56] Scientific viability why under what
[00:04:58] standard because it is not alive and you
[00:05:00] are advocating for the rights of
[00:05:01] something that is not technically a life
[00:05:03] got it so what is is something while
[00:05:05] sacrificing the needs of the human woman
[00:05:08] who is alive got it so but a a a mom can
[00:05:11] survive yes without the baby in her uhuh
[00:05:14] right yes the baby cannot survive
[00:05:16] without the mom yes but a mom cannot
[00:05:18] survive without her lungs so it's not
[00:05:20] her body it's in her body it's not her
[00:05:23] DNA so it's not her choice so it's a it
[00:05:25] actually is directly her DNA it's it is
[00:05:29] 100% it's 50% of her DNA after
[00:05:34] DNA he's going to win I'm telling you
[00:05:37] this this this this could take a while
[00:05:39] okay first of all do we have our terms
[00:05:40] correct we agree actually no so first of
[00:05:42] all I'd like to refine our terms I have
[00:05:43] two points to bring up after that though
[00:05:45] so you Define murder is like
[00:05:46] intentionally like killing a human being
[00:05:48] I think that's a very poor way to Define
[00:05:50] murder because if someone were to like
[00:05:51] break into my home and point a gun at
[00:05:52] the heads of me and everybody I love and
[00:05:54] I intentionally kill them to prevent
[00:05:55] them from un from killing my family I
[00:05:57] don't think I murdered them right so I
[00:05:59] would Define murder as the unjustified
[00:06:02] termination of a human life you're
[00:06:03] making a good point let me further
[00:06:04] clarify then so self-defense is very
[00:06:07] warranted exactly right but I I can see
[00:06:10] where you're going to go with how that
[00:06:12] has to go with abortion but we can go
[00:06:14] down that journey in a second yeah so I
[00:06:16] mean like I I kind of do want to give
[00:06:17] you my argument and so far as why I'm
[00:06:18] pro-choice why I think it's Justified
[00:06:20] but first I think that you know your
[00:06:22] position is quite absurd right because
[00:06:24] you're saying that it is murder to kill
[00:06:25] a human being right at any point in
[00:06:26] development especially when it's in the
[00:06:27] mother's wom my question to you would be
[00:06:29] well does this make women with iuds
[00:06:31] murderers because it is the case that in
[00:06:33] some scenarios an IUD will allow for
[00:06:35] conception to occur meaning there's a
[00:06:37] unique human life there but it will
[00:06:39] prevent its implantation intentionally
[00:06:41] killing it well no preventing
[00:06:42] implantation is not necessarily the same
[00:06:44] thing as terminating a fertilized egg
[00:06:46] for example if you take Plan B for again
[00:06:49] it's not it's not the same thing
[00:06:50] preventing the production of proest
[00:06:52] progesterone is not the same thing as
[00:06:54] terminating a fully a a being that has
[00:06:56] been fertilized you do not know for a
[00:06:58] fact that the egg has been fertilized
[00:06:59] you do not know that when even IUD okay
[00:07:01] yeah so preventing a fertilization or
[00:07:03] implantation to the uter lining is
[00:07:04] killing a conceived zygote so what
[00:07:06] happens a sperm goes into the egg right
[00:07:07] the egg becomes fertilized it's a
[00:07:09] conceived zygote in some cases it will
[00:07:11] prevent the implantation of the
[00:07:12] conceived zygote killing the conceived
[00:07:14] zygote in some cases correct so what do
[00:07:16] you say in some cases women are
[00:07:17] murderers of course not they're not
[00:07:18] murders we do not know for a case that's
[00:07:20] that's like saying that every so what's
[00:07:21] the difference between an IUD killing a
[00:07:22] conceived zygo like a mother going to
[00:07:24] plann Parenthood and killing the fetus
[00:07:26] in her room well so you asking you're
[00:07:27] asking two separate things if they if
[00:07:29] they knew for certain to be more clear
[00:07:31] that I have a fertilized egg and I'm
[00:07:33] going to take a drug to prevent that
[00:07:35] fertilized egg from attaching to their
[00:07:37] uterin wall then yes that is an act of
[00:07:38] killing or murder of course okay so do
[00:07:40] you think all murderers should go to
[00:07:41] jail do I think all murderers should go
[00:07:44] to jail I mean on the third on third
[00:07:46] degree murder however no I don't think
[00:07:48] women that got abortions or had iuds
[00:07:50] should go to jail because I think that
[00:07:51] they have been deceived by mass culture
[00:07:53] M Mass propaganda secondly the people
[00:07:55] who should go to jail are the
[00:07:56] abortionists who are the ones that have
[00:07:58] been putting the abortion pill the ones
[00:08:00] that have been doing procedures the ones
[00:08:01] that have been going into the third
[00:08:03] trimester and breaking babies backs and
[00:08:05] inserting them with syringes while the
[00:08:07] babies are crying and suffocating being
[00:08:09] born alive and then being dead on the
[00:08:12] operating table that is who should go to
[00:08:14] jail
[00:08:16] oh that was actually the best point
[00:08:18] somebody made we'll have to we'll have
[00:08:20] to talk about
[00:08:23] [Music]
[00:08:25] it okay whenever I'm talking about this
[00:08:29] discussion
[00:08:30] um I always go to the question of what
[00:08:33] about in The Case of the mother when her
[00:08:35] life is in danger because I'm a big
[00:08:37] believer I don't I don't know I'm still
[00:08:39] iffy on if I think it's a or if it's
[00:08:40] murder or not but even so I mean I don't
[00:08:44] want to say murder is Justified guys
[00:08:45] wait let me just get this one point and
[00:08:46] then you can vote me out give me one
[00:08:47] second um say the mother gets pregnant
[00:08:51] and she knows that if she gives birth
[00:08:52] she's going to die she has some kind of
[00:08:54] Health complication then what do you do
[00:08:56] in section I don't know what that means
[00:08:58] to C-section they an ins guys wait hold
[00:09:00] on give me one second go right they go
[00:09:02] right below the belly button and they
[00:09:03] deliver the baby and therefore she
[00:09:05] doesn't have to give birth it's
[00:09:06] technically birth but it's much safer so
[00:09:08] that's that's actually safer than an
[00:09:09] abortion
[00:09:11] procedure sorry sorry
[00:09:16] [Music]
[00:09:18] Lily hello how are you hi what's your
[00:09:21] name Deen nice to meet nice to meet you
[00:09:23] um I would say with abortion I think uh
[00:09:25] it's it's very complicated but I think
[00:09:28] the issue that I have primarily with
[00:09:30] your stance of being pro-life that
[00:09:32] there's no Nuance um there's women who
[00:09:34] are being forced to travel hundreds of
[00:09:35] miles to access abortion care even in
[00:09:37] cases of rape in certain States that're
[00:09:39] they're not giving any sort of um
[00:09:41] allowance for that and I think um you
[00:09:44] know a lot of people who are pro-life
[00:09:47] they they say that they're pro-life but
[00:09:48] I feel like they're really Pro birth
[00:09:49] because in you know with Firearms uh the
[00:09:52] United States has some of the highest
[00:09:53] firearm deaths um out of oecd Nations
[00:09:56] right and we can acknowledge that that's
[00:09:57] for children who are actually living in
[00:10:00] um so I feel like abortion while yeah it
[00:10:02] is I can I can definitely see your point
[00:10:05] I I just think that it should be allowed
[00:10:06] in some circum yeah great um I'm happy
[00:10:09] to get into the gun violence stuff later
[00:10:11] but I want to really stay focused on
[00:10:12] abortion right you can see you can say
[00:10:14] you see my point can you see the world
[00:10:16] also where since we know it's a human
[00:10:18] life that it should be illegal since we
[00:10:20] don't allow murder in our society well
[00:10:22] that's that's that's where I have an
[00:10:24] issue because abortion is not being done
[00:10:26] willy-nilly it's it's like the life of
[00:10:29] the mother's always how many abortions
[00:10:30] do you think we have every day in
[00:10:32] America guess I'm not sure I'm not sure
[00:10:35] guess I I'm I'm honestly not sure maybe
[00:10:38] I don't know a th000 4,000 a day so it
[00:10:40] is kind of willy-nilly we have
[00:10:44] 1.6
[00:10:50] [Music]
[00:10:51] sorry hello hi um I just want to clarify
[00:10:55] the thing that you're aiming for is less
[00:10:57] abortion right that would be you would
[00:10:59] want or at least eventually it's also a
[00:11:01] protection of those that can't protect
[00:11:03] themselves but yes and that's why once
[00:11:04] we after the reversal of Row versus Wade
[00:11:06] we saw abortions go down dramatically in
[00:11:08] Texas Alabama Mississippi we saw
[00:11:10] thousands of babies that are now alive
[00:11:11] and well that are able to have amazing
[00:11:13] lives thanks to the reversal of Row
[00:11:14] versus weight uh I don't think a lot of
[00:11:17] that is true um it is but it's not true
[00:11:21] because when you make abortion illegal
[00:11:24] it doesn't actually decrease the amount
[00:11:26] of ab a nice talking point in Texas the
[00:11:28] numbers show differently birth has gone
[00:11:29] up yeah legal goes down but illegal
[00:11:31] abortions still happen abortions still
[00:11:33] happen outside of whatever data you're
[00:11:35] show that's not true but let's just say
[00:11:36] so 40% so well if you if you want to
[00:11:39] well first of all if you count the
[00:11:40] abortion pill you're right but that's a
[00:11:42] separate thing than a chemic chemical
[00:11:44] abortion and surgical abortion different
[00:11:45] things and I'm not debating I'm not I'm
[00:11:47] not debating you I'm debating her so if
[00:11:49] you want to do the flags and come back
[00:11:50] in try and be faster next time so let me
[00:11:52] ask you this so the question is we
[00:11:54] should try to limit unjust suffering of
[00:11:56] human beings right sure okay that's my
[00:11:58] position is that there's unjust
[00:11:59] suffering of anywhere between 1.4 to 1.6
[00:12:02] million abortions a year of human beings
[00:12:04] that are being massacred in the womb and
[00:12:06] so that's not a woman's rights issue
[00:12:07] that's not a men's rights issue that's
[00:12:08] just a human rights issue okay the best
[00:12:10] way to decrease abortions happening is
[00:12:12] proper sex education limiting abortion
[00:12:14] and making abortion illegal does not
[00:12:16] actually decrease the amount of
[00:12:17] abortions that happen so what is your
[00:12:18] evidence of that what is my evidence of
[00:12:20] that because we have increased sex
[00:12:22] education last 30 years we've had no our
[00:12:24] sex education is so bad in America well
[00:12:27] by bad what do you mean by that we have
[00:12:29] we have more access to birth control for
[00:12:31] young kids we have more kids that are
[00:12:32] learning you birth control at a younger
[00:12:34] age we have more of that in our public
[00:12:35] school system and we've seen all the
[00:12:37] trends actually go in a negative
[00:12:39] Direction so in fact we see that the
[00:12:41] more sex exucation there is the the more
[00:12:43] disturbing those Trends are so you say
[00:12:45] that let me ask just one more thing you
[00:12:46] say that if we make abortion illegal
[00:12:49] people will still do it should we then
[00:12:50] just make gang violence legal because no
[00:12:54] I'm saying if you actually wanted to
[00:12:55] decrease the amount of abortions that
[00:12:56] happen you wouldn't be advocating for a
[00:12:58] like to make abortion illegal you'd be
[00:13:00] advocating for Alles that logic apply to
[00:13:02] stealing looting kidnapping ARS sin and
[00:13:04] murder well actually it does because
[00:13:06] those are results of different societal
[00:13:08] issues that you should be educating
[00:13:09] yourself on rather than making ital
[00:13:11] front can we should we make kidnapping
[00:13:13] arson burgly murder legal because
[00:13:15] they're symptoms of something else we
[00:13:17] should be helping Society heal from
[00:13:19] those things got answer the question we
[00:13:21] want less of those things so we just
[00:13:22] make them legal will get less
[00:13:25] looting you know actually I'm going to
[00:13:27] let someone else thank you very much
[00:13:32] [Music]
[00:13:34] hi Parker nice to meet you yes nice to
[00:13:36] meet you Charlie big Tick Tock guy here
[00:13:38] so like uh pedophiles people who were
[00:13:40] married to children in the past and
[00:13:41] normalized in that Society should they
[00:13:43] go to prison should pedophiles like if
[00:13:45] you could go back in time would you put
[00:13:46] those pedophiles in prison that was that
[00:13:47] married those children because it was
[00:13:48] normalized they were deceived into
[00:13:50] thinking it's okay would you put them in
[00:13:51] prison you had to slow down file should
[00:13:53] get the death penalty no so you'd go
[00:13:55] back in the past you give them the death
[00:13:56] penalty even though they were deceived
[00:13:57] into thinking it was okay but you said
[00:13:59] people who get abortions who are women
[00:14:00] shouldn't go to pris but it's not
[00:14:01] currently illegal okay regardless at
[00:14:05] that time at that time it wasn't no I
[00:14:06] would not go back and retroactively
[00:14:08] enforce laws where things were currently
[00:14:09] not illegal you wouldn't put pedophiles
[00:14:10] in prison in the past hold on a second
[00:14:12] when was it ille when was it legal in
[00:14:13] America well child marriage was legal in
[00:14:15] America throughout the early 1900s and
[00:14:17] especially throughout most of society
[00:14:18] for thousands of years especially in the
[00:14:20] Old Testament and in the Bible hold well
[00:14:22] hold on hold on a second so where where
[00:14:24] where is the levitical law that allows
[00:14:26] you to marry a child oh yeah can you
[00:14:28] name the verse so well I can't name the
[00:14:29] first but the particular conditions that
[00:14:30] are enlisted in the Bible are that you
[00:14:32] have to beat physical maturity and
[00:14:33] emotional maturity which is extremely
[00:14:35] vague and throughout Society has been
[00:14:37] seen there is not a verse but let's kind
[00:14:39] of go back back under your VI let's go
[00:14:42] back to well generally agreed upon it's
[00:14:44] 18 years old but let me ask you but you
[00:14:45] but you because you you don't go based
[00:14:46] on what's General you go based on the b
[00:14:48] i I say 18 years old but let me ask you
[00:14:50] a question where's when when does Life
[00:14:51] Begin conception like conception great
[00:14:53] so good so should we protect our life at
[00:14:55] conception I care about Senti in life
[00:14:57] not not so when do brain waves start you
[00:14:58] think brain dead people should be able
[00:14:59] to pull the plug on like family should
[00:15:01] be able to pull the plug on individual
[00:15:02] got to answer the question when do brain
[00:15:04] when do brain waves when do brain waves
[00:15:05] start uh you can see brain waves around
[00:15:07] 6 to 8 weeks which in brain dead
[00:15:08] individual there are brain waves as well
[00:15:10] so the brain waves necessary to produce
[00:15:11] a subjective experience are met until
[00:15:13] around 2 can you see it from my
[00:15:16] perspective that at six to eight weeks
[00:15:17] those brain waves will actually increase
[00:15:19] not decrease if allowed the process of
[00:15:21] development to continue did you know
[00:15:22] those same EEG scans exist in brain dead
[00:15:23] people that you don't think are the
[00:15:25] difference with the brain dead people is
[00:15:26] that the likelihood of those brain waves
[00:15:27] actually increasing is very low at 6 to
[00:15:29] eight weeks when by 15 weeks they can
[00:15:31] hear the it's irreversible sensation
[00:15:32] that's what brain death is I know that
[00:15:34] it's not coma but you're you're you're
[00:15:36] doing a red herring go back to it's not
[00:15:38] what's a red herring six a red herring
[00:15:39] is where you you avoid the topic and you
[00:15:42] say something that is uh adjacent or
[00:15:44] symmetrical to what I'm saying but not
[00:15:45] actually I'm saying me that's not that's
[00:15:48] not a red herring a six to8 week baby if
[00:15:51] they're allowed to continue to develop
[00:15:53] what ends up happening uh at a certain
[00:15:55] point it will become a sentient being in
[00:15:57] the future the same way if I keep
[00:15:58] engaging with my girlfriend there'll be
[00:16:00] a baby in the future yet I don't care
[00:16:01] about unless you're infertile which we
[00:16:02] don't know but so let's let's see let's
[00:16:04] see the the process of development right
[00:16:07] why answer my question why do you have
[00:16:09] the ability or the right should those
[00:16:10] child P3 go to prison the process of
[00:16:13] should the pedophiles Go to Prison from
[00:16:14] 1904 how many pedophiles are alive from
[00:16:16] 1904 they're not alive right I meant
[00:16:18] like if you can go back in the past
[00:16:19] hypothetically speaking and you could
[00:16:20] put them in prison would you put them in
[00:16:22] prison I would have killed them myself
[00:16:23] if I was aive back okay so then so then
[00:16:25] you don't apply it based upon what
[00:16:26] people are deceived to believe you apply
[00:16:27] based on what you consider
[00:16:30] think should
[00:16:34] whys CL constructive debate if you keep
[00:16:37] on talking over me I was finishing my
[00:16:39] statement you were talking over me let
[00:16:41] me ask you a very simple question do you
[00:16:43] think it would be a good thing if we had
[00:16:45] less abortions in America um it depends
[00:16:47] on the context like are the abortions
[00:16:48] prior to sentience yes all abortions
[00:16:51] yeah no it would not be necessarily
[00:16:53] better unless it is the case of the
[00:16:55] people didn't want the abortions and it
[00:16:56] would be negatively impactful to their
[00:16:57] health medically speaking L abortion uh
[00:17:00] after sentience yes okay so you you
[00:17:02] believe in an 8we abortion ban yeah no
[00:17:04] no no I don't I don't sorry I believe in
[00:17:06] an abortion ban after 18 through 26
[00:17:07] weeks okay that's that's a more
[00:17:09] reasonable position I have to give you
[00:17:10] credit for that it's similar to Trump's
[00:17:12] 15 weeks yeah so why why do you think
[00:17:14] that most people don't share your view
[00:17:15] on that um well people just don't know
[00:17:17] really know what sentience is there's
[00:17:18] not a lot of conversation about abortion
[00:17:20] and these conversations are very
[00:17:21] difficult like they're conceptually hard
[00:17:23] to go through and I understand why a lot
[00:17:24] of people don't understand their
[00:17:25] positions on it I think people cutting
[00:17:27] off I thought thought we weren people I
[00:17:29] was actually complimenting
[00:17:35] [Music]
[00:17:37] I how are you nice to see you um so I
[00:17:40] just have one question there's like in
[00:17:42] any case you don't think there's any
[00:17:44] case where abortion should be legal
[00:17:45] there's a very very rare couple cases
[00:17:48] okay so you do think that a couple cases
[00:17:50] it is legal if if if cesarian section is
[00:17:52] not going to save the mother's life and
[00:17:55] the mother's life is actually at risk
[00:17:56] which is debated amongst growing numbers
[00:17:58] of OBGYNs okay that is the only case
[00:18:01] where abortion should be should be
[00:18:02] allowed but people say it is a growing
[00:18:05] consensus in the pro-life world that
[00:18:07] abortion is never medically necessary
[00:18:09] okay so if you had a daughter and she
[00:18:12] was 10 and she got raped and she was
[00:18:14] going to give birth and she no wait oh
[00:18:16] and she was going to give birth and she
[00:18:17] was going to live would you want her to
[00:18:19] go through that and carry her that's
[00:18:22] that's awfully graphic answer it's no
[00:18:23] but it's a real life scenario that
[00:18:25] happens to many people the answer is yes
[00:18:27] the baby would be delivered okay great
[00:18:29] so I that's insane um but let me tell
[00:18:31] you why no hold on let me ask you a
[00:18:32] question there's two ultrasounds I have
[00:18:34] one is a baby conceived in one is a baby
[00:18:36] conceived by a loving couple which one
[00:18:37] is which which which person
[00:18:41] here which person here was conceived by
[00:18:43] tell me which one was conceived by you
[00:18:45] don't know exactly cuz it's all human
[00:18:47] rights and it's all human beings matter
[00:18:48] it's but it's about your daughter who's
[00:18:50] passed to give birth to it and it's
[00:18:52] going to be tortured by that for the
[00:18:53] rest of her life that's going to take
[00:18:55] away every freedom she's ever going to
[00:18:57] have that's going to ruin her life she's
[00:18:59] going to grow up and going vitim crime
[00:19:02] the the point is how you were conceived
[00:19:03] is irrelevant to what human rights you
[00:19:04] get when hold on one second if a person
[00:19:06] conceiv the walks down the side of the
[00:19:08] street it's not like they don't get
[00:19:09] First Amendment rights or second
[00:19:10] amendment rights or the worst thing to
[00:19:12] do to that do the daughter is to then
[00:19:14] say hey we're going to go murder the
[00:19:16] being in inside of you they wouldn't
[00:19:18] even know like listen they they wouldn't
[00:19:20] know listen listen listen listen but
[00:19:22] wouldn't it wouldn't a better story to
[00:19:23] say something evil happened and we do
[00:19:25] something good in the face of evil
[00:19:26] instead of saying we're going to do evil
[00:19:28] and then murder the being because we're
[00:19:29] going to we're going to we're going to
[00:19:30] Pander to the evil no what makes what
[00:19:33] makes the West great is that we do good
[00:19:35] after evil not evil after evil it's not
[00:19:38] about the being and the the cells it's
[00:19:41] not about no no no I'm speaking no I'm
[00:19:43] speaking no I'm speaking I'm speaking no
[00:19:46] I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm
[00:19:47] speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking
[00:19:50] thank you so it's not I'm not talking
[00:19:52] about that I'm talking about the person
[00:19:54] no I'm talking about the person who is
[00:19:56] dealing with the pregnancy I am not
[00:19:59] talking about the cells I don't I don't
[00:20:01] care listen the fetus the whatever I
[00:20:04] don't care about that right now until it
[00:20:06] is
[00:20:08] formed there is if there is a 5-year-old
[00:20:11] child who is pregnant and the baby is
[00:20:13] two weeks in can't get pregnant actually
[00:20:15] they have and they have given birthy old
[00:20:18] have given pregnant correct there is one
[00:20:20] recorded case of a 5-year-old birth is
[00:20:23] that is that is that common yes not it's
[00:20:26] common for 5-year-old get sometimes and
[00:20:28] it's they get pregnant I think they
[00:20:30] should be able to have medical access to
[00:20:33] something that could save not only just
[00:20:35] their life but like their Lively Hood
[00:20:37] how many how many I'm curious how many I
[00:20:38] hope your daughter lives a very happy
[00:20:40] life and gets away from you okay so that
[00:20:44] is really nasty and so her her belief
[00:20:48] system just so we're clear is that the
[00:20:52] time's up yeah no I got it it's fine I
[00:20:54] mean it's insanely nasty and we'll talk
[00:20:56] again my next claim is that college is a
[00:21:05] scam hello hello hello what's your name
[00:21:08] I'm Maddox how are you doing good so
[00:21:11] college is a scam well let's define our
[00:21:12] terms College being traditional for your
[00:21:14] college of course University not
[00:21:16] Community College or Technical College
[00:21:18] course a scam if we can agree on a
[00:21:19] definition is where a majority of people
[00:21:21] who will go through the institution or
[00:21:24] business uh they're not getting their
[00:21:25] money's worth their time's worth um and
[00:21:27] they're being deceived when they sign up
[00:21:28] so do we agree on those terms yeah
[00:21:30] perfect okay well what would further
[00:21:32] definitions what do you think is the
[00:21:33] purpose of going to college the purpose
[00:21:35] of college should be a traditional
[00:21:36] liberal arts education the pursuit of
[00:21:38] what is good true and beautiful okay
[00:21:39] that's not what it is uh it should be
[00:21:41] the betterment of yourself and your soul
[00:21:43] uh nurturing your character uh and
[00:21:45] becoming a better citizen understanding
[00:21:47] the deeper things in life at the very
[00:21:49] least though it should be preparing one
[00:21:50] for the job market do you think college
[00:21:52] does those things I think it does uh but
[00:21:55] I would add on to your point that I
[00:21:56] think not only is it for the betterment
[00:21:58] of your s but it's the for the
[00:21:59] betterment of society we need historians
[00:22:02] we need certain majors that may not make
[00:22:04] as much money I think those are for the
[00:22:05] betterment of society would you agree
[00:22:07] that there's some Majors that may not
[00:22:09] make money but are still essential to it
[00:22:11] depends do you think that getting a
[00:22:12] degree in gender studies is good for
[00:22:14] society uh I would agree yeah why why
[00:22:16] would studying gender not be good for
[00:22:19] study well learning that men can give
[00:22:20] birth is not exactly a good use of time
[00:22:22] is it is that what they're teaching in
[00:22:23] college right now colleges yeah
[00:22:24] according to the Center for Disease
[00:22:25] Control they no longer say women can
[00:22:27] give birth they say birthing person
[00:22:29] okay do you think men can give birth do
[00:22:30] I think men can give birth I think that
[00:22:32] uh yes or no question I think that a
[00:22:35] person who is assigned male at Birth I
[00:22:36] don't think they assign mail at Birth so
[00:22:38] people are not male at Birth I think
[00:22:40] that a person see you're evidence that
[00:22:41] college is a scam my friend college is a
[00:22:43] scam you're not you're lacking in a lot
[00:22:44] of here we can continue right now so
[00:22:46] gender studies do you think that
[00:22:48] studying gender is uh uh not Essential
[00:22:51] should we not deepen our first of all I
[00:22:53] don't think gender we're going to get
[00:22:54] there later I don't think gender exists
[00:22:55] I think that there are two Sexes
[00:22:57] infinite personalities and genders
[00:22:59] however let's get back to the core
[00:23:00] contention can I ask my question again
[00:23:02] real quick well I want to get back to my
[00:23:04] core contention a scam so the majority
[00:23:06] of kids that go to college if they end
[00:23:08] up getting a job at all they end up
[00:23:09] getting a job that does not require a
[00:23:11] college degree do you think that certain
[00:23:13] jobs that may not associate with a
[00:23:15] direct major can incorporate skills that
[00:23:17] you learn from a major I think I'm
[00:23:19] personally I'm an econ major and
[00:23:21] depending on what job I do in the future
[00:23:23] I can still use the skills earned from
[00:23:25] so tell me about Milton fredman tell me
[00:23:27] about Milton Freedman he is an economist
[00:23:30] from how about Thomas Soul Thomas Soul
[00:23:33] lud vanus lud well I will say that first
[00:23:37] how
[00:23:39] about I'd love to see you answer the
[00:23:41] gender studies question we will get
[00:23:42] there
[00:23:43] later that's that's what psychedelics
[00:23:46] are for uh who's
[00:23:50] [Music]
[00:23:52] next um well I think it's difficult to
[00:23:55] think about just one major thinking
[00:23:57] about just gender studies like sure like
[00:23:59] not everyone should be a gender Studies
[00:24:00] major we need doctors we need lawyers we
[00:24:02] need everything however why does it
[00:24:04] matter if 10 people want to be a gender
[00:24:07] Studies major and it matters to them
[00:24:09] like not everyone can be a lawyer not
[00:24:11] everyone can be a doctor there needs to
[00:24:13] be some people and you know what yeah it
[00:24:14] sucks that some people do go to college
[00:24:16] and get a degree and then they end up
[00:24:17] not in a Workforce for that but I don't
[00:24:19] think that has to do with like college
[00:24:21] was a scam it's more like maybe that
[00:24:23] just wasn't the path for them or that
[00:24:25] life choice was just too hard to get for
[00:24:27] them but some people are able to go to
[00:24:29] college and get a degree and use it and
[00:24:31] that is super important because imagine
[00:24:33] if no doctors went to college they just
[00:24:34] like I think I can do it well of course
[00:24:35] doctors and lawyers need credentialing
[00:24:37] right but well less than 5% of all
[00:24:39] people that go to college end up
[00:24:40] studying medicine or in legal the vast
[00:24:42] majority go into soft social sciences
[00:24:44] Communications with the humanities so
[00:24:46] you're in college or have been is that
[00:24:47] correct yeah are you forced to take
[00:24:49] classes that you think are a waste of
[00:24:50] time yeah I'm for you know what on so
[00:24:52] they're taking your money and they're
[00:24:54] forcing you that they're a waste of time
[00:24:56] that's kind of scammy right oh I think
[00:24:58] that some classes o some so you have to
[00:25:00] probably go in debt right depends okay
[00:25:03] are you going you going are you going
[00:25:05] into debt no okay well that's good I
[00:25:07] picked a school that actually offered me
[00:25:08] a scholarship someone else is paying for
[00:25:10] your college oh I I don't know depends
[00:25:12] on me I mean that school that wanted to
[00:25:14] give me an opportunity but that's not
[00:25:15] what we're talking about we're talking
[00:25:16] about talking about the scam element
[00:25:18] right so you said that there are some
[00:25:20] classes that if students had to go into
[00:25:21] debt or had to pay for would not be a
[00:25:23] good use of their time so it's not
[00:25:25] representing students well well do you
[00:25:27] think like high school is scam then cuz
[00:25:29] I had to pay for high school but I
[00:25:30] didn't I'm not going to use AP US
[00:25:32] History in my psychology degree ever
[00:25:34] well I think AP US History is actually a
[00:25:36] really good use of time knowing about
[00:25:37] your country and your history and well
[00:25:38] but I'm not going to use that in my
[00:25:40] career that's what we're talking about
[00:25:41] in the career path for college let's go
[00:25:43] back to what I said right we said
[00:25:45] traditional college right fouryear
[00:25:47] college and what a scam is we're a
[00:25:49] majority a majority of the people that
[00:25:51] will go through the Enterprise the
[00:25:52] business or the institution are not
[00:25:54] getting their time Worth or their money
[00:25:55] worth so therefore I go back to my core
[00:25:57] contention which is a majority of kids
[00:25:59] that exit College will not use their
[00:26:01] degree at all when they go to find a job
[00:26:03] but if you ask them do you think college
[00:26:05] was a scam I don't think majority of
[00:26:06] them are going to say yes some of them
[00:26:08] will some of them are going to well not
[00:26:09] everyone who's being scammed actively
[00:26:11] knows they're being scammed people still
[00:26:12] buy erectile dysfunction drugs off the
[00:26:14] internet and they get scammed that's
[00:26:16] their own personal choice of course
[00:26:18] people have choices to be scammed I'm
[00:26:19] not saying they don't have a choice I'm
[00:26:21] making an observation analysis of the
[00:26:23] institution for example flying Spirit
[00:26:24] Airlines kind of a scam should be shut
[00:26:27] down there is some yeah agree there are
[00:26:29] some things in life we have to take a
[00:26:30] step back and like oh the consumer is
[00:26:31] not being well served you want to shut
[00:26:33] down a bunch of majors in colleges that
[00:26:36] you think are scams no I never said that
[00:26:38] so what would your proposal be to fix
[00:26:39] the scam of college there is no proposal
[00:26:42] I'm simply the contention is college is
[00:26:44] a scam so then what's the point of that
[00:26:45] statement to get you to agree but like
[00:26:48] what would that do like what do you want
[00:26:49] to fix in college that's going to help
[00:26:52] in not be a scam let's we can get to
[00:26:53] step interval two as long as you can
[00:26:55] agree that college is a scam no cuz not
[00:26:58] for everyone for me I'm using a degree
[00:27:00] that's going to help me help people make
[00:27:01] better what are you studying psychology
[00:27:03] and criminal justice okay so and it's
[00:27:06] being paid for by somebody else which is
[00:27:08] which is fine that's good so psychology
[00:27:09] and criminal justice um do you do you
[00:27:12] absolutely need to get a degree to be
[00:27:14] able to get you do yeah I really I mean
[00:27:17] like I could I guess study it all on my
[00:27:19] own but it's just like makes more sense
[00:27:21] to go and have all these experience I'm
[00:27:23] getting like wonderful experiences
[00:27:25] internships all through my college
[00:27:27] that's helping
[00:27:29] no it's just that this is a paway that's
[00:27:31] really helping me so you know there's 11
[00:27:33] million jobs open in the country right
[00:27:34] now that don't require a college degree
[00:27:36] okay then the people who want those jobs
[00:27:37] can go get those jobs I'm not one of
[00:27:39] those push too many kids into college no
[00:27:42] okay so the national graduation rate is
[00:27:44] 59% if I asked the room everyone would
[00:27:46] agree that they know some people that
[00:27:47] went to college that did not graduate
[00:27:49] yeah right so we're probably sending too
[00:27:51] many kids into this institution but if
[00:27:53] they might have been able to do it then
[00:27:55] like why is it not worth it to try and
[00:27:56] to push yourself to get a better
[00:27:59] education and go further that's a bad
[00:28:01] thing right but some people are able to
[00:28:03] work through that and it's like an
[00:28:05] opportunity thing when an institution is
[00:28:07] multi-trillion dollars in scale involves
[00:28:09] 23 million of our citizens every four
[00:28:12] years and is not actually better in the
[00:28:14] country for example if College was so
[00:28:15] great we would see incomes going up for
[00:28:17] Gen Z and Millennials we'd see more
[00:28:19] people able to own homes kids wouldn't
[00:28:28] I'm telling you this is so ableist what
[00:28:30] you're doing by the way I'm telling you
[00:28:33] right hello what's your name Al nice to
[00:28:36] meet you okay so let me start by saying
[00:28:38] well first of all you said we're sending
[00:28:39] too many kids to college who's sending
[00:28:41] them who's forcing them guidance
[00:28:42] counselors parents Community are they
[00:28:44] forcing them are they signing them up
[00:28:45] themselves forcing I never said forcing
[00:28:47] but you can have nudging and forcing are
[00:28:49] two different things we also subsidize
[00:28:51] College through the federal government
[00:28:52] so you guys get subsidized interest
[00:28:53] rates scholarships and Loans so the
[00:28:55] taxpayer is nudging students
[00:28:58] and gently and sometimes forcely pushing
[00:29:00] them into college and you would agree it
[00:29:02] is an expectation if you grow up in a
[00:29:05] upper middle class home to go to college
[00:29:06] you would agree with that so there's a
[00:29:07] societal cultural push I didn't grow up
[00:29:09] in an upper middle class so okay well
[00:29:11] but do you would you see it from their
[00:29:13] would you see how that's that argument
[00:29:15] is correct I guess there might be a
[00:29:17] pressure but no one's sending them
[00:29:18] you're sending yourself well of course
[00:29:20] well we're all over the age of 18 right
[00:29:22] when you're in college so you're sending
[00:29:24] yourself but that's besides let's be
[00:29:25] honest I mean for that's a silly
[00:29:27] argument
[00:29:29] yes they're technically send themselves
[00:29:30] I was just at Arizona State University
[00:29:32] moving everyone had their parents there
[00:29:34] they were co-signing on loans they were
[00:29:35] there helping pay for stuff parents the
[00:29:37] ones that are still checking in they're
[00:29:38] the ones that largely subsidize their
[00:29:39] lifestyle hey Mom can you vend me Veno
[00:29:41] me 3,000 bucks so that I can go out an
[00:29:43] extra night yes of course when you're 18
[00:29:45] years old you're the one signing on the
[00:29:46] dotted line but there's enormous
[00:29:48] pressure and nudging and cultural
[00:29:50] expectation that students go to college
[00:29:53] right okay I think the problem here is
[00:29:55] that it's it's up to the person you're
[00:29:58] you're not you can't just go to college
[00:29:59] and expect to come out with a degree you
[00:30:01] have to put the work in you have to put
[00:30:02] the work in you have to make connections
[00:30:04] and some people might think college is
[00:30:05] just four years of partying and drinking
[00:30:07] and making friends whatever but you have
[00:30:08] to actually put the work in and if you
[00:30:10] put the work in you make connections
[00:30:11] then you can find a job right outside of
[00:30:13] college well no not not doubting that
[00:30:16] you can't find a job it's just that 52%
[00:30:18] of them get a job that doesn't require
[00:30:19] them to get the degree but most jobs
[00:30:21] offer intent to pay if you have a degree
[00:30:23] and 86% 86% of people with a degree get
[00:30:27] paid more then people with just a high
[00:30:29] school diploma that's only if you count
[00:30:31] the ones at the top 10% of in income
[00:30:32] iners so not if you count Humanities not
[00:30:35] if you count um people that study in the
[00:30:37] uh social sciences if you count medicine
[00:30:39] or you count law that's absolutely
[00:30:41] correct however the vast majority of
[00:30:43] kids that go to college are not studying
[00:30:45] medicine law engineering business
[00:30:47] finance they're studying Communications
[00:30:49] social scien or Humanities which are on
[00:30:50] the lower income ladder so as I
[00:30:52] mentioned we have 11 million job
[00:30:53] openings in this country right now that
[00:30:55] do not require a college degree I'm
[00:30:57] guessing in this room that within four
[00:30:59] to five years you guys would killed to
[00:31:00] be able to earn 80,000 $80 to $100,000 a
[00:31:02] year yes do you know that in States
[00:31:04] across the country and in cities they're
[00:31:07] offering apprenticeships become plumbers
[00:31:08] and welders electricians that doesn't
[00:31:10] require for your college degree entrance
[00:31:11] salary $80,000 a year but again 86% of
[00:31:15] people with a bachelor's degree earn
[00:31:17] more than people with a high school
[00:31:19] dipla no 86% of all people with a
[00:31:21] bachelor's degree if you take out the
[00:31:22] top 10% it's actually lower than those
[00:31:24] that don't go to college so the reason
[00:31:25] that number that average goes up is
[00:31:27] because the the doctors and the
[00:31:28] engineers and the lawyers are the ones
[00:31:30] that bring that average so significantly
[00:31:32] up but let me ask you a question that do
[00:31:34] you think that there's any waste at all
[00:31:36] in the current College model do I think
[00:31:38] there's any waste I don't think we need
[00:31:39] all of it okay good what part um well
[00:31:42] you have to start with your core classes
[00:31:44] and it's like high school you're taking
[00:31:45] the same classes in do you think like
[00:31:47] for example um do you think that it's
[00:31:51] okay nice to meet you
[00:31:56] [Music]
[00:31:59] wow I'm Emily nice to meet you Emily
[00:32:01] thank you um earlier said that about 5%
[00:32:05] of college students are going into
[00:32:07] fields of like medicine law and
[00:32:08] Engineering was it let let me clarify
[00:32:10] yes as far as they're going to be able
[00:32:11] to get postgraduate degrees so they will
[00:32:13] go all the way up and get their jurist
[00:32:14] master or they will end up passing the
[00:32:16] bar or becoming a doctor right so it's
[00:32:18] easy to say doctors lawyers but Health
[00:32:20] Care Professionals if you count nurses
[00:32:22] or people that work in healthcare that
[00:32:23] number is closer to 20 25% okay so 5% um
[00:32:27] who has a doctor can you like raise your
[00:32:29] hand if you have a doctor like a medical
[00:32:32] doctor a doctor yeah like a medical
[00:32:34] doctor yeah you do okay um 5% is still a
[00:32:38] lot of people right of course but that
[00:32:40] means 95% might not need to exist at the
[00:32:42] institution I don't think that's the
[00:32:44] takeaway just because 5% which is still
[00:32:46] millions of Americans all across board
[00:32:48] but if you were to say hey we only have
[00:32:49] medical schools only have legal we can
[00:32:51] get rid of gender studies get rid of so
[00:32:53] what's what's the contention well gender
[00:32:54] studies is actually if you look on like
[00:32:56] the pre-law track gender studies is a
[00:32:57] pre law track if you're going to be a
[00:32:58] lawyer you have to study gender studies
[00:33:00] and other social cult point that college
[00:33:02] is a scam why would why would a lawyer
[00:33:03] need to study gender studies should a
[00:33:05] lawyer know the law it's a social
[00:33:06] science the law you think the law isn't
[00:33:08] inadvertently affected by social
[00:33:10] cultural and gender Norms of course it
[00:33:11] is but shouldn't they first know the
[00:33:12] Bill of Rights the Constitution The
[00:33:13] Federalist Papers we learned that in
[00:33:15] high school okay so what is marber
[00:33:17] versus
[00:33:18] Madison I haven't been in high school
[00:33:19] for a really long time I'm not trying to
[00:33:21] be a lawyer Lear yeah so I mean high
[00:33:24] schools are brown what was Brown versus
[00:33:25] the Board of Education that's for
[00:33:27] desegregating school okay good yeah
[00:33:28] which project 2025 wants to like defund
[00:33:31] the Department of Education who wrote
[00:33:33] the Constitution founding fathers 1778 I
[00:33:36] don't know it wasn't 17 at 78 I don't
[00:33:38] know yeah you don't know no okay well
[00:33:41] this is the point is that you don't
[00:33:42] learn it in high school you don't even
[00:33:43] learn it in undergraduate and our our
[00:33:44] law school is not learning it so maybe
[00:33:46] well I'm not in law school no the point
[00:33:47] is that you were saying they already
[00:33:48] learned it and they don't I don't want
[00:33:49] this to be a pop quiz or trivia I didn't
[00:33:51] go to college and I'm asking you very
[00:33:53] basic Civic questions and you're paying
[00:33:55] to go to college and you can't answer
[00:33:56] them that's so fair but I
[00:33:59] think thank you
[00:34:04] [Music]
[00:34:09] sorry I have a question is church a scam
[00:34:12] no because church is honoring the Divine
[00:34:13] and the internal and the good and the
[00:34:14] true and the Beautiful is college but it
[00:34:16] but it deceives people because you you
[00:34:18] give a promise of everlasting life which
[00:34:20] you don't actually get because
[00:34:21] Christianity is contradictory logically
[00:34:22] speaking do you want to get into a
[00:34:24] theological debate or are we going to
[00:34:25] talk about college because I complet
[00:34:27] completely disagree Jesus Christ is my
[00:34:29] Lord and Savior and we will have eternal
[00:34:30] life okay so how if there is a perfect
[00:34:32] being that created the world how could
[00:34:34] we exist in an imperfect world I'm happy
[00:34:36] to have this discussion can we go back
[00:34:37] to college though because do you think
[00:34:39] because that's a little bit of a red
[00:34:41] herring and a little bit of a rabbit
[00:34:42] hole tell me what that has to do with
[00:34:44] college being a scam well I do think
[00:34:45] college can be a scam for certain people
[00:34:47] I don't think it's a scam for everyone
[00:34:49] for people like me college was very
[00:34:50] beneficial for me for sure I'm asking
[00:34:53] you based upon your definition of a scam
[00:34:54] do you consider the Christian Church a
[00:34:56] scam of course not it's giving people
[00:34:57] life and treat teaches them goodness
[00:34:59] Christianity is false then that's a
[00:35:00] deception okay but you think it's false
[00:35:02] I don't we can agree to disagree also
[00:35:03] I'm not agreeing to disagree on that but
[00:35:04] we're not talking about we're not
[00:35:06] talking about the church we're talking
[00:35:07] about college right so again also people
[00:35:09] are not paying to go to church are they
[00:35:11] but it's a redu absurdum you know that
[00:35:12] is ask the question what's a redu out
[00:35:13] ofum uh that's a Latin term that means
[00:35:16] reducing down to the lowest common
[00:35:18] belief correct yeah so I'm taking am I
[00:35:19] right I didn't go to college I knew that
[00:35:21] I'm taking your particular position let
[00:35:22] let me ask you a question without you
[00:35:23] interrupting me do you pay to go to
[00:35:24] church uh no I don't some people forced
[00:35:28] to pay based upon their particular
[00:35:29] denomination in today do you pay to go
[00:35:30] to church depending on the church no no
[00:35:32] you don't do you have to go to debt and
[00:35:33] to go to church uh in some circumstances
[00:35:36] people do because they have to give up
[00:35:37] 10% of their income to be able to do
[00:35:39] that which people can't circumstance
[00:35:40] well they're LDS you understand that a
[00:35:42] lot of LDS Churches specifically require
[00:35:43] 10% they don't require it and you're
[00:35:46] talk do in plenty of places well you're
[00:35:47] asking Mainline Christian isn't their
[00:35:49] stigmatization if you don't do that okay
[00:35:51] you're good at interrupting not good at
[00:35:52] answering well you haven't answered any
[00:35:54] of my questions yet I did say no church
[00:35:55] is not a scam church is the bride of
[00:35:57] Christ college is a scam and college is
[00:36:00] people are going into debt they're
[00:36:02] paying a lot of money but I want to ask
[00:36:03] you a question you said it's a scam for
[00:36:04] some people who is it a scam for yeah
[00:36:06] for people who specifically aren't ever
[00:36:08] going to use it never use any of the
[00:36:09] knowledge that they from it well you say
[00:36:11] 52% I don't think you can grant qualify
[00:36:13] 52% of people don't do that for example
[00:36:15] for example my job that's not going to
[00:36:17] be recommended like as like an economics
[00:36:18] degree and most economics Majors AR
[00:36:20] going to go into Tik Tok debating online
[00:36:22] but I use the information that I learned
[00:36:23] in college in like on in my job on a
[00:36:26] daily basis so I still
[00:36:28] qualities that are then used in my job
[00:36:30] later on what percentage of kids that go
[00:36:32] to college are being scammed can you I
[00:36:33] don't think I don't think anyone knows
[00:36:34] that it's dependent upon an individual I
[00:36:36] have no clue shouldn't we try to find
[00:36:37] out well if you'd like to find some
[00:36:39] empirics on that I'd love to see it I I
[00:36:40] just did so 41 41 well well the
[00:36:43] Department of Education is a source no
[00:36:45] the Department of Education doesn't say
[00:36:46] 41% of people it was a scam for or that
[00:36:48] they didn't use any of the information
[00:36:50] they learned in college you are you are
[00:36:51] using so are you saying none of them use
[00:36:52] any of the information can I say three
[00:36:54] words without you interrupting me do any
[00:36:56] of them use the information L on can I
[00:36:58] say five words that interrupt you've
[00:36:59] interruped me multip time multiple times
[00:37:01] so since you say college is a scam for
[00:37:04] some people it's a ballpark for the kids
[00:37:07] that do not graduate 41% that ended up
[00:37:09] going and not graduating were they
[00:37:11] scammed uh no just because you go and
[00:37:13] pay for a particular thing but then you
[00:37:15] don't follow through with it doesn't
[00:37:16] mean you were scammed maybe they were
[00:37:18] you decided to pay for it oh you could
[00:37:19] say some people are misled some people
[00:37:20] are sing to these things some people are
[00:37:23] met in are misled in the church and you
[00:37:24] never answered my question on that
[00:37:26] because you're trying to I did take that
[00:37:27] time down so you don't have to answer
[00:37:28] the question about Christianity because
[00:37:30] you know your world if you looks
[00:37:31] terrible well what about Christianity
[00:37:32] you want me to answer we're talking I
[00:37:33] think it's false because I was saying is
[00:37:35] is church a scam if church is a scam
[00:37:38] that'd be predicated off of the idea
[00:37:39] that you're deceived into believing that
[00:37:40] there's everlasting life specifically
[00:37:42] from Christianity again so Christianity
[00:37:44] has to be true so can you grant that
[00:37:45] what's the argument Christianity is true
[00:37:46] did the resur what the argument you're
[00:37:48] going to let me finish three words in a
[00:37:50] row appreciate it okay did the
[00:37:53] resurrection happen uh I don't think the
[00:37:55] resurrection occurred okay I disagree
[00:37:58] okay so let me ask you a question a
[00:38:00] perfect Creator is it possible for them
[00:38:02] to not desire something imperfect a
[00:38:04] perfect is a perfect Creator I'm sorry
[00:38:07] what there's a perfect creator that
[00:38:09] desires everything that's just perfect
[00:38:10] how can they desire something imperfect
[00:38:12] flaud well because maybe they want to
[00:38:13] get to know themselves maybe they want
[00:38:14] to see their own creation maybe they
[00:38:15] love want get to know them can I can I
[00:38:18] finish can I finish talking here okay
[00:38:21] maybe because God loved the world so
[00:38:22] much that his creation which rebelled
[00:38:24] against him given agency and Free Will
[00:38:26] rebelled against them then got eternal
[00:38:28] life what we actually deserve and then
[00:38:30] sent his son on a rescue mission to save
[00:38:32] us from that the church is the bride of
[00:38:35] Christ will save us from Damnation that
[00:38:37] we deserve college is far from the Bride
[00:38:40] Of America it's currently scamming the
[00:38:42] Youth of this country and sending them
[00:38:44] into Oblivion didn't answer the question
[00:38:46] I I did no you didn't say how they could
[00:38:47] desire something imperfect how how well
[00:38:50] God can anything that later God can do
[00:38:52] anything so even something logically
[00:38:55] contradictory it's not logically
[00:38:56] contradictory so desire something imp an
[00:38:58] un can an Unstoppable can an Unstoppable
[00:39:01] object can an Unstoppable object hit
[00:39:03] aable
[00:39:06] Force hey before we go any further we

[00:40:10] thanks again to straight arrow news for
[00:40:12] partnering with us on this episode now
[00:40:14] let's get into it yeah my next claim is
[00:40:16] that trans women are not
[00:40:21] [Music]
[00:40:22] women okay what's your name Sam nice to
[00:40:25] meet you uh let's define our term
[00:40:27] uh a woman is an adult female of XX
[00:40:29] chromosomes you tell me what is a woman
[00:40:32] I think a woman is somebody who
[00:40:33] identifies as a woman got it so that's
[00:40:35] not a definition that's like saying a
[00:40:36] table is something that identifies as a
[00:40:38] table give me an objective definition of
[00:40:39] no it's not a table is an object well
[00:40:41] tell tell a table can't identify as
[00:40:43] anything it doesn't haveo you have to
[00:40:45] give me an objective definition of what
[00:40:47] a woman is if I decided right now that I
[00:40:49] wanted to identify as a woman I would be
[00:40:51] a
[00:40:52] woman okay but that's not that doesn't
[00:40:54] answer the question I know but right now
[00:40:56] I'm a man right so if that happened
[00:40:57] right now woman once once a person makes
[00:41:00] the decision to identify as a woman
[00:41:02] woman that's a separate issue what is a
[00:41:03] woman that's the definition no I know
[00:41:06] but you have to tell me what a person
[00:41:07] who identifies thems as a woman but you
[00:41:09] have ident how do you know that they are
[00:41:11] that thing how do I I don't need to know
[00:41:14] what they I can ask them if I want to
[00:41:15] know but there needs to be you need to
[00:41:17] tell me what that thing is though
[00:41:20] somebody who we're not getting anywhere
[00:41:22] we're not getting any it's important
[00:41:23] because it's like saying a giraffe is a
[00:41:25] thing that looks like a giraffe or a
[00:41:26] coyot thing that looks like a coyote
[00:41:28] it's called circular reasoning you have
[00:41:30] to give me a actual definition I don't
[00:41:32] have to I I did give you a definition no
[00:41:35] you said that a woman is something that
[00:41:36] thinks they're a woman that doesn't give
[00:41:38] me a definition that simply what would
[00:41:40] you consider a definition then an adult
[00:41:42] female with XX no no I mean like what
[00:41:44] what makes that a
[00:41:54] definition hello hi Juliana jul
[00:41:58] um I don't necessarily think that you
[00:42:00] can define a woman just by her
[00:42:02] chromosomes women are so much more than
[00:42:04] that they come in a variety of shapes
[00:42:06] sizes colors and I don't necessarily
[00:42:08] think that you can count out somebody
[00:42:09] who's trans just because they don't have
[00:42:11] a certain set of chromosomes there are
[00:42:13] also people who are born I'm trying to
[00:42:15] I'm drawing a blank uh intersects so XX
[00:42:18] y or Y YX or just yeah or like x0
[00:42:20] nothing so so natural mutations upon the
[00:42:24] binary essentially right yes so but but
[00:42:26] they don't have both sex organs that
[00:42:28] both that both operate right yeah but
[00:42:30] that also I don't think necessarily
[00:42:31] works right because if it's X there's a
[00:42:35] so you're either more male or more
[00:42:37] female right so you might have both a
[00:42:38] penis and vagina but there's never been
[00:42:39] a case of someone who can impregnate
[00:42:41] themselves okay I also don't necessarily
[00:42:44] think that uh works for this situation
[00:42:46] but um I also want to say that one of my
[00:42:48] best friends is trans and I would say
[00:42:49] that she's more of a woman than I am I
[00:42:51] think that women Define themselves by
[00:42:53] multiple things not just their sex
[00:42:55] organs if somebody asked me who I was as
[00:42:57] a woman I would not say I have a vagina
[00:42:59] totally fair no I think you said
[00:43:01] something smart so you said that person
[00:43:02] is more of a woman than you are
[00:43:04] therefore you're greatting off a
[00:43:05] definition of something accomplishes
[00:43:07] Womanhood what is that I think it's well
[00:43:10] that's the thing too and I I do think
[00:43:12] that gets a little complicated right
[00:43:13] because there are social norms for a
[00:43:15] gender but I do think we try to break
[00:43:16] that right for sure but you said that
[00:43:18] specific friend is more of a woman than
[00:43:20] you are
[00:43:21] why I think she's a better person than
[00:43:24] me I think she Liv women are better
[00:43:25] people she's a better woman than I am
[00:43:27] I'm not saying women are better people
[00:43:28] no but what what makes a woman a woman
[00:43:30] because you said she's more of a woman
[00:43:31] than you are so I want to know what that
[00:43:33] definition is right okay I'm going to
[00:43:36] let somebody else go thank
[00:43:43] you okay all right Parker what is a
[00:43:46] woman uh a woman is an adult human
[00:43:48] person that has a desire to be in
[00:43:49] accordance with a particular set of
[00:43:51] Social and cultural norms that are
[00:43:52] typically associated with a female sex
[00:43:53] Define a man associate you're looking at
[00:43:55] one XY chromosomes and okay do does God
[00:43:58] the father have XY chromosomes
[00:44:00] Incarnation we literally have a
[00:44:01] religious a father and he's he him but
[00:44:03] he's not a man we have a religious so a
[00:44:05] man is someone with XY chromosomes but
[00:44:07] he doesn't have XY chromosomes he's
[00:44:08] still a man he still use prefer actually
[00:44:10] very interesting in the original Hebrew
[00:44:11] Adonai do you know what Adon is it's the
[00:44:13] Hebrew word for God it's actually
[00:44:15] genderless but in this in actually in
[00:44:17] the scriptures they use he right and
[00:44:20] they use the masculine Jesus Christ came
[00:44:23] to Earth as a man not as a woman not as
[00:44:25] gender queer but let's go back to
[00:44:27] but God the father is a man right All
[00:44:29] fathers are men well first of all
[00:44:30] there's a trinity so God the father is
[00:44:32] neither man nor woman he is omnicient
[00:44:34] omnipotent he is all being on top of so
[00:44:36] why do you use he well I did not the
[00:44:37] scriptures do you could use woman you
[00:44:40] could say her you could use him but the
[00:44:42] way that the language is structured
[00:44:43] again it is so the God the father is so
[00:44:45] above gender it is so above any of our
[00:44:47] understanding with glory and
[00:44:49] understanding again because you have to
[00:44:51] make a choice either he or him him or
[00:44:53] her in the Original Scriptures let's go
[00:44:55] back to I'm Happ father AR so I'm I'm so
[00:44:58] some fathers are not men and boys not
[00:45:00] men or boys I'm sorry some fathers are
[00:45:02] not male no of course they are I'm not
[00:45:04] wait so God the father is a male hold on
[00:45:05] God the father so where where do we get
[00:45:07] God the father from what what Greek word
[00:45:08] from your scripture well from ABA right
[00:45:10] which is a very close personal ter
[00:45:12] you're not answering my questions and
[00:45:13] you bring up random language that
[00:45:14] doesn't matter well it actually does no
[00:45:15] it doesn't but let me let me get down to
[00:45:17] the root of it because I CU he's not a
[00:45:18] man you know he's not a man under your
[00:45:19] worldview yet you still use his
[00:45:20] preferred pron you still call him a man
[00:45:22] you don't do that with trans people
[00:45:23] because you're transphobic that's why
[00:45:24] okay got it but Christ is a man I'm
[00:45:26] happy to get into the sexuality and
[00:45:28] gation not of the Trinity okay before
[00:45:31] Incarnation there's no penis there's no
[00:45:32] XY chromisms there's no small G second
[00:45:34] let's think about it if that's correct
[00:45:36] how is it then Jacob saw the face of God
[00:45:40] okay so if there's hold on if there was
[00:45:42] not before the Incarnation how did Jacob
[00:45:43] see the face of God how did Jacob
[00:45:45] wrestle with God characters can have
[00:45:46] faces without biology how did Jacob
[00:45:48] wrestle with God so so okay do you think
[00:45:50] that he has a body well or was that a
[00:45:52] figurative notion of of wrestle that's
[00:45:53] that's a mystery of the scriptures I'm
[00:45:55] not here well it is I'm not here to
[00:45:57] debate theology can we go back to we
[00:45:58] talking about he does he actual biology
[00:46:00] you keep trying to Pivot because you
[00:46:01] know this debunks you what what biology
[00:46:03] does your God have what what well the
[00:46:05] one of Christ Our Lord the I meant
[00:46:06] before Incarnation well I I to be honest
[00:46:08] I don't quite know and I don't think the
[00:46:10] scriptures are you don't know what a man
[00:46:11] is well you can't Define what a man is
[00:46:12] it's a little opaque again you're
[00:46:14] looking at a man but your your video the
[00:46:16] largest video on Tik Tok is what is a
[00:46:17] woman 20 million views but you don't
[00:46:19] know what a man is on your own world VI
[00:46:20] I said you're looking at a man right
[00:46:22] wait but God the father doesn't meet
[00:46:23] that criteria am I looking at a man okay
[00:46:25] good just make a man that's de beating
[00:46:26] you in
[00:46:27] that's fine so let me ask you a question
[00:46:29] though so do you think that anybody can
[00:46:32] become a woman um I think that anyone
[00:46:34] who meets my criteria is a woman what's
[00:46:35] your criteria again adult human person
[00:46:37] that has a desire to be in accordance
[00:46:39] with a particular set of Social and
[00:46:40] cultural norms that are typically
[00:46:41] associated with the female sex can
[00:46:42] Society ever be wrong sure but like it's
[00:46:45] it's it's a it's a desire to be in
[00:46:46] accordance with a set of Social and
[00:46:48] cultural norms can I become if I black
[00:46:50] face no because it's not a desire that
[00:46:52] you have to be in accordance with
[00:46:53] particular because race is defined
[00:46:55] phenotypically based upon the expression
[00:46:57] to other people but you're by some
[00:46:58] standard you're judging that do you
[00:47:00] think there's a phenotypical expression
[00:47:01] of someone who's white and someone who's
[00:47:02] black like I see you're white because
[00:47:03] you're phenotypical expression right so
[00:47:06] but do you think but Rachel doelle that
[00:47:08] said she is black and culturally black
[00:47:09] is she black does she does she have
[00:47:11] phenotypically uh characteristics we
[00:47:13] would associate phenotypical I'm not
[00:47:14] sure what that word means photp it's
[00:47:16] going to be the like the the
[00:47:18] expression yes okay so she she she could
[00:47:21] pass as a black person wait so she
[00:47:23] doesn't have the melanin content she's
[00:47:25] borderline no okay so then she's not
[00:47:27] black okay so you're able to say who is
[00:47:30] black and not black that's how we Define
[00:47:32] it in society no okay got it so but
[00:47:35] is there an objective definition of who
[00:47:36] is Black wait language is all subjective
[00:47:38] Linguistics professionals indicate it's
[00:47:39] subjective language is all subjective
[00:47:41] yes absolutely every word you just used
[00:47:43] was created by other human beings that
[00:47:45] are engaging in conversation you might
[00:47:46] think it's created by God but even then
[00:47:47] it's still subjective now wewh God
[00:47:50] subject now we're getting similar is the
[00:47:52] word and the value behind murder
[00:47:55] objective or subjective well I think
[00:47:57] morality is subjective but you think
[00:47:58] it's subjective too because it comes
[00:47:59] from God that's interesting wait does it
[00:48:00] come from God or independent of God well
[00:48:02] no it's of course it comes from God it's
[00:48:03] Transcendent being that's subjective yes
[00:48:05] it is if it comes from God it's it's
[00:48:07] specifically subjective it comes
[00:48:08] independent of God then it's objective
[00:48:10] what you just told me is is also comp
[00:48:13] moral antirealism so let's go back to
[00:48:14] the Ten Commandments you don't
[00:48:15] understand meta ethics well I I hold on
[00:48:17] a second what does subjective morality
[00:48:18] mean what does subjective morality means
[00:48:20] that it it comes in everybody's own
[00:48:22] opinion their own form not dependent on
[00:48:24] a stance God is a stance and that's the
[00:48:27] truth of morality so if let's let's
[00:48:29] let's believe do you believe in the if
[00:48:31] everybody believed in the concept of God
[00:48:33] the Transcendent God that there was a
[00:48:35] Ten Commandments and we should live by
[00:48:36] them right is that objective morality no
[00:48:39] just because people agree do make it
[00:48:41] objective again independent of stance AG
[00:48:44] is what is objective morality
[00:48:47] that sorry thanks we we'll be back at it
[00:48:50] next
[00:48:55] time Mason get are you nice to meet you
[00:48:57] okay so I think it's a little scummy
[00:48:59] that you're plagiarizing the whole Matt
[00:49:00] Walsh thing like your thing is the
[00:49:02] worship of Israel like that I pay him
[00:49:04] royalties okay for sure well do you want
[00:49:06] to talk about sex first or do you want
[00:49:07] to talk about gender I don't think
[00:49:08] gender exists I think it's a it's a it's
[00:49:10] a term that John money and Judith Butler
[00:49:12] created over the last 40 years that
[00:49:13] basically is a filler for personalities
[00:49:15] okay well if we're talking about sex
[00:49:16] which it seems like you're saying is the
[00:49:17] exact same thing um would you say sex is
[00:49:19] binary by definition for sure yes
[00:49:21] absolutely okay so you're already in
[00:49:23] correct like sex is not binary it's
[00:49:24] bodal so if you look at a distribution
[00:49:26] graph we're going to see people in two
[00:49:28] camps majority of the time but there are
[00:49:29] going to be externalities on both ends
[00:49:31] of the spectrum and in the middle we
[00:49:33] talk about inter however with intersects
[00:49:36] though they are mutations of a binary
[00:49:37] correct no we're we're talking about on
[00:49:39] but which we're talking about an entire
[00:49:40] Spectrum which which by definition
[00:49:43] defeating your expression of what a
[00:49:45] binary is by saying that there are
[00:49:46] externalities but but let me ask you a
[00:49:48] question that like
[00:49:50] xxy you're trying to create this own box
[00:49:53] and then use any examples that are
[00:49:55] outside of that box you brought up
[00:49:57] justify that box again you brought up
[00:49:58] interex we're talking about reality you
[00:50:01] brought up intersex what sex organs
[00:50:03] which one is more dominant what do you
[00:50:05] mean in an xxy situation can you explain
[00:50:08] your your point of view obviously you
[00:50:10] have more female characteristics than
[00:50:11] male characteristics in an xxy or it
[00:50:13] might be y YX one of the one of the two
[00:50:15] the point is that you do you do not have
[00:50:16] both we could see people with female
[00:50:19] reproductive organs that have XY and we
[00:50:21] can see the vice versa people with male
[00:50:22] reproductive organs that have ex sex so
[00:50:24] I think you said something about gender
[00:50:25] though I think that's more inter to get
[00:50:27] into do you understand how the convers
[00:50:29] we moving off of sex CU you're seing
[00:50:30] that argument no I'm not seing it you
[00:50:32] want to keep going into it we can if
[00:50:33] You' like okay so so besides male and
[00:50:35] female what categories exist we we have
[00:50:37] people that are interex we have people
[00:50:38] that are on the other ends of the bodal
[00:50:40] distribution gra are you are you aware
[00:50:41] what bodal means versus binary um
[00:50:44] somewhat of an understanding okay well
[00:50:45] you can be presented with a graph after
[00:50:47] this by the people that you brought with
[00:50:48] you but it's it's actually B
[00:50:50] distribution just like constantly going
[00:50:51] to condescending type talk is not going
[00:50:53] to be fruit I'm just trying to match
[00:50:54] your energy with the people that you
[00:50:55] treated that were trying to have a
[00:50:57] trans women are not women do you agree
[00:50:59] with that uh I would say that trans
[00:51:00] women are women because people that
[00:51:03] exist under the category of women people
[00:51:05] that exist under the category of men are
[00:51:06] still humans so that category how how is
[00:51:08] that defined well I wouldn't limit it to
[00:51:10] things like genitals or things like
[00:51:11] chromosomes which seems like you want to
[00:51:12] do um what type of genitals would you
[00:51:14] say I have since there OB genitals I'm
[00:51:17] not obsess genitals but I could do a
[00:51:18] blood sampling right now and I could see
[00:51:20] exactly what you are because every
[00:51:21] single one of your trillions of cells
[00:51:24] are either coded with XX or XY no no how
[00:51:26] much surgery or whatever I think that
[00:51:28] you are man but you could fool me you
[00:51:29] could take hormones you could play
[00:51:31] camouflage like I could fool you to be
[00:51:32] Hispanic if I had the right Hollywood
[00:51:34] makeup director that doesn't mean that
[00:51:35] you are the thing though but but you're
[00:51:37] going from an objective biological
[00:51:39] perspective which we've already talked
[00:51:40] about with sex I'm talking about a
[00:51:41] social construct or a social utility so
[00:51:45] like if we were at a restaurant right
[00:51:46] I'm sitting down and I'm sitting down at
[00:51:48] the table and you're telling the waiter
[00:51:50] hey I want to go sit with blank what
[00:51:51] would you use with you he doesn't know
[00:51:53] my name yeah I'm sitting over there that
[00:51:55] guy yeah yes correct guy you're going to
[00:51:57] typically use he or him or you're going
[00:51:59] to say that guy like you just said
[00:52:00] correct because you're ascribing the
[00:52:02] male gender to me based on my I say I
[00:52:06] could be an error maybe you are a
[00:52:07] biological woman and then you'd correct
[00:52:08] yourself right that take may maybe maybe
[00:52:10] not so that's what we that is exactly
[00:52:12] what we're trying to say we're so the
[00:52:14] question is that do you think that
[00:52:16] Womanhood can then be assumed just
[00:52:18] through costume design it's not costume
[00:52:20] design what is it then it's performative
[00:52:22] social characteris so you could act
[00:52:24] that's what gender is great it so you
[00:52:26] could it's like a theater troop it's not
[00:52:28] a theater troop these are social these
[00:52:29] are social can be appropriated no
[00:52:32] they're C they're categories that's what
[00:52:33] it is so so there's nothing inherent
[00:52:35] about the chromosomes there's nothing
[00:52:37] that correct wow we disagree so there's
[00:52:39] nothing inherent about having a period
[00:52:41] or being able to give birth or the
[00:52:43] specific hormonal makeup in different
[00:52:44] cultures we've ascribed that to
[00:52:45] Womanhood if you go back to other
[00:52:47] cultures spending thousands of years
[00:52:49] you'll see a difference when it like for
[00:52:51] example the Mayans had plenty of people
[00:52:52] that were schizophrenic right so that
[00:52:53] means nothing to me right okay we have
[00:52:54] people that say they're hearing things
[00:52:55] from God would you say that
[00:52:56] schizophrenic well not necessarily it
[00:52:58] built western civilization and common
[00:52:59] law and due process and individual
[00:53:02] rights defense of The Unborn and the
[00:53:03] greatest civilization ever you know that
[00:53:05] voice from God happened to build the
[00:53:06] greatest nation ever to exist in the
[00:53:07] history of the world that's fine okay I
[00:53:08] think the minds would say the same thing
[00:53:10] that's the problem with presuppositional
[00:53:11] arguments is that you could say mean
[00:53:13] God's telling me right
[00:53:14] now do you think that's real can we go
[00:53:16] visit the M Nation they didn't last that
[00:53:17] long did they yeah overkilling and
[00:53:19] violence and you can justify that if you
[00:53:20] like you mean all the child sacrifice
[00:53:22] this is the kind of that why I'm trying
[00:53:23] to match it is because you mean all the
[00:53:25] child sacrifice the mines and incin dead
[00:53:27] on the top of temples great civilization
[00:53:28] you want to go back in the Old Testament
[00:53:29] let's bring Parker up in here talk about
[00:53:31] all the the child child marriage we can
[00:53:33] talk about the justification of R where
[00:53:35] was child sacrifice ever in the Bible um
[00:53:38] when Isaac or Isaac was almost
[00:53:40] sacrificed by his dad he wasn't though
[00:53:42] because at the beginning of Genesis so
[00:53:43] God just said like no just kidding dog
[00:53:45] don't actually why because at the
[00:53:46] beginning of Genesis 16 said I'm going
[00:53:47] to test to Pro obedience yeah that's
[00:53:49] right so now you know it so actually no
[00:53:51] there was no child sacrifice in the
[00:53:52] Bible it was a Prohibition on child
[00:53:54] sacrifice the but anyway that's a little
[00:53:55] bit of a rabbit hole do you understand
[00:53:56] at least can you sympathize with our
[00:53:58] perspective okay that that I'll calm it
[00:54:00] down a little bit I apologize for the
[00:54:02] con I mean you're doing it's it's fine
[00:54:04] but you see where this could get wildly
[00:54:06] out of control at least on the I don't
[00:54:08] see how it get out of control because
[00:54:09] even in sports for example you think
[00:54:11] that there's no there's so this is this
[00:54:12] is something that we might be able to
[00:54:13] agree upon right Sports were not
[00:54:15] archaeologically dug up right the rules
[00:54:17] of sports they are things that we've
[00:54:18] created as a society we have decided as
[00:54:20] a society the most Fair categorization
[00:54:22] is male Sports and female sports now as
[00:54:25] we've been able to understand or at
[00:54:26] least bring into the Forefront people
[00:54:28] who don't identify with the bind we
[00:54:30] still have to allow all people that are
[00:54:32] women in the women's category and all
[00:54:34] men that are men in the women's category
[00:54:35] that includes CIS and trans if you'd
[00:54:37] like to change that category because you
[00:54:38] think it's unfair we can do that that's
[00:54:40] what's awesome about arbitrary rules is
[00:54:42] we can decide hormones I might not know
[00:54:44] this but like when the Greeks started
[00:54:46] the Olympics 2,000 years ago did they
[00:54:47] have like a bunch of dudes wrestling
[00:54:50] with women I don't even think they
[00:54:51] allowed women to compete well I might be
[00:54:53] wrong on that but that kind of proves
[00:54:54] the point though that there was a what
[00:54:56] did we do to allow women we changed the
[00:54:58] rules right no but that by definition
[00:55:00] therefore there is something from body
[00:55:02] composition bone mass long density
[00:55:04] testosterone and estrogen rates so
[00:55:06] Endocrinology is different if you if
[00:55:07] you'd say the majority of males in the
[00:55:09] botal distribution graph we're going
[00:55:10] back to that you can say hey we we want
[00:55:12] this level of hormones in this
[00:55:14] particular category and we can separate
[00:55:15] it by hormones I agree with you that a
[00:55:17] majority of men are majority of sity you
[00:55:20] got to be like 99.9% I don't know Ronda
[00:55:22] Rousey could kick my ass I will say that
[00:55:24] no for sure but I mean but could she
[00:55:26] kick Conor McGregor's ass well now we're
[00:55:28] talking about the Peaks right she said
[00:55:30] theend no because you're talking about
[00:55:32] the peaks of two different categories in
[00:55:33] the same sort of right because because
[00:55:35] why she's a CIS woman well she's a CIS
[00:55:38] woman and a CIS man but yes and he could
[00:55:41] kick her tail right yes I would agree
[00:55:43] okay for sure right because CIS men and
[00:55:45] CIS women have different hormone levels
[00:55:47] if you want to change the hormones we
[00:55:48] can change the categorization you're
[00:55:50] saying that you want men and women Bar
[00:55:53] None and you say that's the most like
[00:55:54] Fair category then we have to
[00:55:57] all men but again there those things
[00:55:59] don't so I just want to be clear so
[00:56:01] because I think I'm tracking your
[00:56:02] argument is that in the University of
[00:56:03] Pennsylvania swim team when Thomas swam
[00:56:06] against biological women that was you're
[00:56:08] perfectly fine with that I think as long
[00:56:10] as we have the categories that way
[00:56:12] thanks good to meet you
[00:56:17] yeah you want to get him in this isn't
[00:56:19] debated yet no no no you're fine you're
[00:56:20] fine you're fine what's your name hi my
[00:56:22] name is pry nice to meet youney nice to
[00:56:24] meet you go ahead pry pry t r you're
[00:56:27] totally yeah um okay so I kind of want
[00:56:29] to go back to a little earlier you said
[00:56:31] that a Parker has lower T than you so
[00:56:33] would you say a joke yeah no no I'm I'm
[00:56:35] fully I'm fully aware of a joke but I
[00:56:37] guess like on that on that point do you
[00:56:39] think that like tea has to do or
[00:56:41] testosterone has to do with your manhood
[00:56:43] like well yes and no I mean for if you
[00:56:45] are looking at typical testosterone
[00:56:47] estone rates of women they are far
[00:56:49] different than those of men but for
[00:56:51] example like your testosterone rate goes
[00:56:52] down when you have children for example
[00:56:54] when you're a man that doesn't make you
[00:56:55] less of a man they go they go down by by
[00:56:56] 400 points okay but like when we were
[00:56:58] talking earlier about like sports right
[00:57:00] and you were saying that the reason why
[00:57:02] it's unfair for like like for example a
[00:57:05] trans woman who used to be a man to be
[00:57:07] like competing in women's sports you
[00:57:09] said you cited that they have higher
[00:57:10] testosterone levels one of about 50
[00:57:12] characteristics also lung density the
[00:57:15] men's hearts are bigger we have greater
[00:57:17] bone B bone bone density muscle mass
[00:57:20] okay be faster T to be stronger I I
[00:57:22] understand but like those factors all
[00:57:24] come from the hormones during the
[00:57:25] development process say correct no not
[00:57:27] necessarily no I mean most of them do
[00:57:29] well not all of them so for example you
[00:57:30] could try to pump a young girl's body
[00:57:33] with testosterone at 8 years old and you
[00:57:35] can get them stronger you cannot
[00:57:36] necessarily get them on par with a
[00:57:39] biological male at puberty you cannot
[00:57:41] you could try okay but like because
[00:57:43] there's something in the coding of our
[00:57:44] genetics the coding of our genetics
[00:57:46] which is often like controlled by like
[00:57:48] different like I guess parts of our DNA
[00:57:50] and also the hormones that are produced
[00:57:52] that affect the the effective coding
[00:57:56] ology it's a big part because for
[00:57:57] example if you just give a kid
[00:57:58] testosterone that doesn't even get them
[00:58:00] close to becoming a male or estrogen
[00:58:02] giving them a female they might get
[00:58:04] characteristics that are close to that
[00:58:06] right okay but it does for but I mean
[00:58:08] like there's no perfect image of like
[00:58:10] this is what a female looks like this is
[00:58:11] what a male looks like like we all get
[00:58:12] our periods at different ages some of us
[00:58:14] like like and also like for example like
[00:58:17] there are many circumstances where
[00:58:19] Womanhood is just not one thing right
[00:58:21] it's a multitude of experiences every
[00:58:24] single person can you define what
[00:58:25] Womanhood is that's an interesting
[00:58:26] question for you well no I can't Define
[00:58:28] what Womanhood is and the reason why is
[00:58:30] because it's something that's an
[00:58:31] individual experience for every single
[00:58:33] person right like my experiences what I
[00:58:36] have experienced throughout my life is
[00:58:37] not going to be the same as another
[00:58:39] woman who may have like grown up in a
[00:58:41] different environment disagreement but
[00:58:42] not Clarity I say that being a woman or
[00:58:44] Womanhood is an objective thing right
[00:58:46] but objective outside of one own's
[00:58:48] opinions or experien so but are we at
[00:58:50] the point where we're discussing where
[00:58:52] this is like not something based on your
[00:58:54] chromosones but something maybe based on
[00:58:56] a construct well no it also can be
[00:58:58] objectively witnessed in empirical ways
[00:59:00] in biological ways in scientific ways
[00:59:03] okay so to clarify we're still
[00:59:05] discussing whether Womanhood is on
[00:59:07] chromosomes or not if if you'd like to
[00:59:09] discuss that it's deeper than just
[00:59:10] chromosones right right I'm just trying
[00:59:11] to for ex for example if we look at spec
[00:59:14] scans or brain scans of men and women
[00:59:16] 98% of the time artificial intelligence
[00:59:18] can tell you which one is the men and
[00:59:19] which one is the male female okay so our
[00:59:22] different parts of our brains fire so
[00:59:23] for for men for men for example are
[00:59:26] amygdalas are not as highw working as
[00:59:28] women you know what amydala is the
[00:59:30] threat assessment part of your so
[00:59:31] obviously like your birth so there's a
[00:59:33] difference between the concept or what
[00:59:35] sex is which is a biological aspect and
[00:59:37] what gender is which is a social
[00:59:39] construct I reject gender completely as
[00:59:41] a different word it's really personal
[00:59:43] that's where the debate is it's the
[00:59:44] existence of gender gender gender means
[00:59:46] personality okay I don't doubt that
[00:59:49] biological men might havein how would
[00:59:51] you define race on that point how would
[00:59:53] I Define how you def race well race is a
[00:59:55] very difficult topic top okay because I
[00:59:57] think that it's a really important thing
[00:59:58] to discuss when it comes if I draw if I
[01:00:01] draw blood is it ethnic lines is it if
[01:00:04] you have a blood sample of a black
[01:00:05] individual and a white individual I
[01:00:06] can't tell you which one is which if I
[01:00:08] have a blood sample of a man and a woman
[01:00:10] I can tell you which one is which just
[01:00:12] by running very simple Elementary blood
[01:00:13] tests so for example if there was a
[01:00:15] Hispanic or a white there is no
[01:00:17] difference in the genetic coding there
[01:00:20] just isn't why is it important that
[01:00:22] someone's oh okay
[01:00:26] my next claim is that kamla Harris is a
[01:00:28] Dei
[01:00:32] [Music]
[01:00:33] candidate a lot of competition Mason
[01:00:36] yeah exactly good to see you good to see
[01:00:37] you again um can I define what a Dei
[01:00:40] candidate is I I think that you're GNA
[01:00:41] say because she's black and she's a
[01:00:42] woman she's appointed because Joe Biden
[01:00:43] promised that and it's is not a
[01:00:45] testament to her not only that but also
[01:00:47] in the her getting the nomination of the
[01:00:48] Democrat Party they said repeatedly we
[01:00:50] do not want to pass over a black female
[01:00:52] okay so just those two things but the
[01:00:54] first one is stronger you're right Joe
[01:00:56] Biden said I'm going to put on my vice
[01:00:58] presidency a black female right right so
[01:00:59] his criteria yeah and that was like
[01:01:01] Karen bass and KLA Harris so she was not
[01:01:03] chosen because of her intellect or her
[01:01:05] accomplishments or because of any of
[01:01:07] that it was because she happened to fit
[01:01:09] a couple boxes in fact Amy kachar the
[01:01:11] vetting at the time was that Amy kobar
[01:01:13] would have been a better VP and kamla
[01:01:15] ended up getting it so it's just a
[01:01:16] statement of fact that she is there not
[01:01:18] because of her Brilliance or
[01:01:20] accomplishments but because of her
[01:01:21] ethnicity so KLA Harris first and
[01:01:24] foremost there are a lot of criticism
[01:01:26] that you can give to her on why she
[01:01:27] wouldn't be an effective president it
[01:01:28] shouldn't be because she's a woman or
[01:01:29] because she's black and it seems to be
[01:01:31] that you're I'm just I just want people
[01:01:32] to understand and agree she didn't earn
[01:01:34] this she she absolutely did she has she
[01:01:36] has a career where she's been not only a
[01:01:38] de de stands one earn it just so we're
[01:01:40] clear but like it stands for diversity
[01:01:42] Equity inclusion I like the meme though
[01:01:43] I I know what it is but do you at least
[01:01:45] admit and acknowledge that when Joe
[01:01:46] Biden was searching for a VP he cared
[01:01:48] more about skin color and a female than
[01:01:51] the smartest best person so the the
[01:01:53] whole conversation with this affirmative
[01:01:55] action with Dei the whole reason why
[01:01:57] people bring it in is to make this
[01:01:58] imaginary scenario that there's a super
[01:02:00] qualified white man who was overpassed
[01:02:03] by this unqualified stupid idiot person
[01:02:06] of color which is such a terrible
[01:02:08] analogy because it's not true absolutely
[01:02:10] not true that's not what it is Jo bid
[01:02:12] did not say I'm going to choose an
[01:02:13] unqualified person just his own team
[01:02:16] he's saying that I'm going to have two
[01:02:17] qualified people if one comes from a
[01:02:19] different experience it might be better
[01:02:20] to have a diversity and have a better
[01:02:22] perception in forms of he said at the
[01:02:23] South Carolina debate that will pick a
[01:02:26] black woman as my vice president
[01:02:28] secondly Amy kachar came out is this a
[01:02:30] random black woman that he plucked off
[01:02:31] the street or is this a qualified DEA
[01:02:34] general attorney who's had a decorated
[01:02:36] career leading government positions you
[01:02:38] can but you keep rambling about things
[01:02:40] that just aren't relevant to what we're
[01:02:41] talking it is relevant AB kachar in
[01:02:42] vetting came across as the more
[01:02:43] qualified candidate why because they
[01:02:45] said kamla Harris wasn't very smart
[01:02:47] wasn't very bright that's their own
[01:02:48] vetting documents from the from who Joe
[01:02:50] Biden's own vetting documents show why
[01:02:52] would he go against that because the
[01:02:53] base of the Democrat Party demands
[01:02:54] tribal politics and Dei politics over
[01:02:56] competency that's completely inur he
[01:02:58] stated to Jim kber said I will only
[01:03:01] endorse you in the South Carolina
[01:03:02] primary if you say that you're going to
[01:03:03] put a black person preferably a black
[01:03:05] female on your ticket with you therefore
[01:03:07] you winnow the entire universe down and
[01:03:09] say I'm only going to choose from this
[01:03:11] criteria and let's just think more
[01:03:12] broadly if you're about to have heart
[01:03:13] surgery would you rather have a heart
[01:03:15] surgeon that's good and excellent knows
[01:03:16] what he's doing or someone that is a
[01:03:18] black female so and being president is
[01:03:20] more important than being a heart
[01:03:21] surgeon aren't you on record saying that
[01:03:22] you'd be terrified if there was a black
[01:03:24] pilot that was was flying I did say that
[01:03:26] but what why what was the full quote I I
[01:03:29] personally I don't know if you want to
[01:03:30] expand on yeah so this this ties into
[01:03:32] this United Airlines said that half of
[01:03:34] all their new hes are going to be black
[01:03:36] or women and that standards and pursuit
[01:03:38] of Excellence is not going to be taken
[01:03:40] as um seriously as diversity when I'm
[01:03:43] flying a plane I want to know my pilot
[01:03:45] is there because they're a good pilot
[01:03:47] not because they fit some Dei box damn
[01:03:49] it I wish we could have a better
[01:03:50] conversation I'm sorry man
[01:03:57] fast man okay so let's say that KLA
[01:04:00] Harris was the Dei hire as vice
[01:04:02] president do you think she's also a deer
[01:04:05] as the Presidential nominee for the
[01:04:06] Democratic party potentially yeah I mean
[01:04:08] they decided to go to her almost
[01:04:10] immediately because she is the VP but
[01:04:11] also because she fits some criteria
[01:04:13] boxes but let me ask you you you don't
[01:04:14] think it's because Joe Biden nominated
[01:04:17] or no for sure that's part of it of
[01:04:18] course it is but let me ask you what's
[01:04:19] her greatest achievement accomplishment
[01:04:20] her greatest achievement accomplishment
[01:04:22] I'd say her greatest achievement or
[01:04:23] accomplishment is completely destroying
[01:04:25] their Republican party within like 2
[01:04:27] weeks of being nominated like in the
[01:04:29] polls she's just absolutely
[01:04:33] huh
[01:04:40] sorry how are you nice to see you what's
[01:04:43] your name Amanda Amanda so you believe
[01:04:45] because kamla is black and a woman she
[01:04:47] was chosen for belief her own team Joe
[01:04:50] Biden said that he said I said that yeah
[01:04:52] he said I'm first because beforehand he
[01:04:54] said I'm going to choose a black female
[01:04:55] for vice president president he didn't
[01:04:56] say I'm going to choose the most gifted
[01:04:57] or the most talented or the most
[01:04:58] accomplished he said so he said I'm
[01:05:00] going to choose a black female and so by
[01:05:03] definition that is Dei that is not the
[01:05:06] definition of Dei by him saying that he
[01:05:08] was going to choose a black female that
[01:05:10] could insinuate that he already had
[01:05:11] comma mind for the role no way does that
[01:05:14] insinuate that she's Dei what is Dei
[01:05:16] then Dei would be choosing somebody
[01:05:20] based on their race no it's giving
[01:05:22] people of color the opportunity to be
[01:05:24] welcomed into spaces in which they
[01:05:26] typically AR able to get there's never
[01:05:27] been a female black vice president and
[01:05:29] why do you think that is well not why
[01:05:31] you just said that's
[01:05:33] Dei so by definition she's Dei okay so
[01:05:36] she represents diversity within the
[01:05:38] government no I'm saying she got
[01:05:39] elevated because she was a black female
[01:05:42] because if that were the case I'd be the
[01:05:43] president right now do do you do you
[01:05:45] think do you think kamla Harris was
[01:05:46] chosen because of her intelligence her
[01:05:48] qualifications and her intelligence
[01:05:50] really wow if you compare what's
[01:05:53] greatest accom what's her greatest
[01:05:54] accomplish prosecutor within the
[01:05:57] Northern California area you mean
[01:05:58] letting out violent criminals and
[01:05:59] turning San Francisco one of the most
[01:06:01] murderous dangerous arson fied homeless
[01:06:03] field slums in the country that's her
[01:06:05] greatest accomplishment see I actually
[01:06:07] went to UC Berkeley so I lived there I
[01:06:09] don't know if you did uh I went around
[01:06:11] Berkeley is a slum Berkeley is a slum
[01:06:13] have you stepped into Berkeley yes I
[01:06:15] have you think Oakland and Berkeley have
[01:06:16] you lived in Berkeley I've lived in
[01:06:18] Oakland as well your basing your you
[01:06:20] think the Bay Area is like a good area
[01:06:22] in this country I'm from Vegas so I'm
[01:06:24] not from the bay born raised in Vegas
[01:06:26] and went to UC Berkeley CH graduated
[01:06:28] this year what you're saying literally
[01:06:31] in no way shape formar so you think her
[01:06:34] overseeing San Francisco becoming the
[01:06:36] laughing stock of the country is fris is
[01:06:38] not the laughing stock of the country if
[01:06:40] anything that'ss Florida no offense but
[01:06:42] hold on if that's the case why are
[01:06:44] millions of people moving to Florida and
[01:06:45] millions of people leaving California
[01:06:47] because there are cheaper rates there
[01:06:49] people are moving to Las Vegas Las Vegas
[01:06:52] it's cheaper because it's a better run
[01:06:53] State and we don't give money to
[01:06:56] is Northern California is not the
[01:06:58] entirety of California there's Southern
[01:07:00] California Cali why is it that so many
[01:07:02] businesses are leaving San Francisco if
[01:07:04] she did such a great job lowering crime
[01:07:06] do you know businesses go where things
[01:07:08] are cheapest to operate why are they
[01:07:10] cheaper because they're better run
[01:07:11] states do you realize that California is
[01:07:13] one of the most populated states within
[01:07:15] the US so obviously cost are going to be
[01:07:17] high not only that but land within this
[01:07:20] state is also very very very minimal so
[01:07:25] hold on you have you have tons of land
[01:07:27] you're one of the biggest states in
[01:07:28] country yes it is one of the biggest
[01:07:29] lands but do you also take into account
[01:07:31] the population that's here yes Florida
[01:07:34] and Texas have a greater combined
[01:07:35] population than California and Cal
[01:07:38] California has more population and more
[01:07:41] more land mass than Florida why is it
[01:07:43] that San Francisco has a declining
[01:07:44] population and Miami Tampa Orlando have
[01:07:47] an increasing population what does this
[01:07:48] have to do with Dei because she ran San
[01:07:50] Francisco poorly and she was chosen as a
[01:07:53] VP because she was a black woman San
[01:07:56] Francisco she was the da da of San
[01:07:58] Francisco she's Prosecuting and then she
[01:08:01] became the AG of California where crime
[01:08:02] went up homelessness went up arson went
[01:08:04] up kidnapping went up is it not the job
[01:08:07] of the police to get the criminal the
[01:08:09] attorney the attorney general of the
[01:08:10] state is the top cop of the state yes
[01:08:12] and what did she do to lower crime in
[01:08:13] California she convicted those who were
[01:08:15] guilty why did crime go up because as
[01:08:19] the population increases and this econ e
[01:08:23] economy gets worse no
[01:08:26] wor people are becoming more and more
[01:08:28] desperate which leads to C of crime
[01:08:31] thank
[01:08:31] [Applause]
[01:08:39] you mine will be quick mine will be
[01:08:41] really quick goad okay so real quick
[01:08:43] you're saying that the only reason she
[01:08:45] was elected was is because she's black
[01:08:48] so that trumps her being a district
[01:08:50] attorney and all the this is not my
[01:08:51] words I'm just going on Joe Biden's own
[01:08:52] words Joe Biden said I'm going to preset
[01:08:54] criteria based based on black women and
[01:08:56] therefore she met that met that criteria
[01:08:58] and that's why she was selected no why I
[01:09:00] think he was what he was trying to say
[01:09:03] is oh I'm she's just black she was just
[01:09:04] calling her black she's not saying I'm
[01:09:06] doing he's not saying he's not saying
[01:09:08] I'm doing this because she's black
[01:09:10] that's not what she said he made a
[01:09:11] public promise before the selection even
[01:09:13] began and the process began I will put a
[01:09:15] black woman on the ticket so you're
[01:09:16] saying her being dist attorney doesn't
[01:09:18] matter that's not why but an aw being a
[01:09:21] failed
[01:09:22] businessman and making all the comments
[01:09:25] weird comments he's made well hold on a
[01:09:26] second that doesn't have like what I'm
[01:09:27] getting at though is that if she was not
[01:09:29] a black woman she never would have been
[01:09:31] chosen as vice president her record was
[01:09:33] abysmal she was a terrible Attorney
[01:09:35] General of California she had
[01:09:42] poorly I'm so sorry I'll be quior I'll
[01:09:45] be quick I'm so sorry she she gets the
[01:09:46] next one yeah all right sorry yeah I
[01:09:49] just have to know do you think Tim Waltz
[01:09:50] is a Dei candidate okay I just wanted to
[01:09:52] see consist Dei does not mean black
[01:09:54] timal was only chosen because the
[01:09:56] Democrat Party is doing so poorly with
[01:09:58] white men that they tried to find a
[01:09:59] white man that they could put on the
[01:10:01] ticket but then also true Tim Walls is
[01:10:02] the first White Dei candidate in history
[01:10:04] okay in the Democratic primaries KLA
[01:10:05] harros was performing incredibly well
[01:10:08] and she wasn't performing well in the
[01:10:09] primaries just because she was black she
[01:10:11] was performing well in the primaries
[01:10:12] because during her time as a senator she
[01:10:14] spoke incredibly eloquently I used to
[01:10:16] watch hold on a second how did she do in
[01:10:17] the Democrat primaries she did like much
[01:10:20] better than Amy kachar she didn't even
[01:10:22] make it to Iowa she dropped out months
[01:10:24] ahead of the first primary she was super
[01:10:26] unpopular not well-liked her campaign
[01:10:29] fizzled out so she was she was popular
[01:10:32] initially initially yes and then the
[01:10:33] more people learned about her the more
[01:10:34] realized she was awful well it was
[01:10:36] mostly because like progressives are
[01:10:37] really upset about her being a DA which
[01:10:39] like can be like that that's a
[01:10:41] completely different why aren't
[01:10:42] progressives upset about that now I mean
[01:10:44] they are but oh they are that's new to
[01:10:46] me everyone's talking about how great
[01:10:48] prosecut she is progressives are
[01:10:49] definitely upset about the like how um
[01:10:51] like the Biden Administration has
[01:10:53] handled like the atrocities and gods and
[01:10:55] how like they they are definitely things
[01:10:57] that Democrats are upset about however
[01:10:59] that's not the point of this
[01:11:00] conversation i that's correct that is
[01:11:01] not Point that's not the point what the
[01:11:03] point is is that a lot
[01:11:12] of a thanks
[01:11:16] guys okay hi how are you doing right so
[01:11:21] um you keep saying that K Harris is a
[01:11:23] dii candidate and I feel my main fallacy
[01:11:26] with this argument is that competency
[01:11:29] can't be
[01:11:30] objectively determined because we all
[01:11:33] have subjective definitions of what a
[01:11:35] competent politician is but my question
[01:11:38] for you is if kamla Harris is a Dei
[01:11:41] candidate why is she beating Trump in
[01:11:43] the polls right now we'll see what
[01:11:44] happens in November okay but she's
[01:11:45] currently beating Trump in the polls so
[01:11:47] either if the polls are right I grant
[01:11:49] you that she's incompetent or or maybe
[01:11:51] she's a new candidate with a big surge I
[01:11:53] I I would caution you being a little
[01:11:55] like this point in the election getting
[01:11:56] too cocky because we remember what
[01:11:57] happened with I'm not getting cocky I'm
[01:11:58] asking you to answer a question if she
[01:12:00] is incompetent how could she beat the
[01:12:01] president who you said is an as of the
[01:12:03] timing of this filming can you name to
[01:12:05] me how many times she sat down for an
[01:12:06] interview what no she refuses to talk to
[01:12:09] the Press refuses to take questions
[01:12:10] she's not one sit down interview in
[01:12:12] nearly 25 days at the filming of this
[01:12:13] interview mind you which I don't know a
[01:12:16] very weird point to make why would I
[01:12:18] count how many times kamla Harris has
[01:12:21] interview because she refuses to take
[01:12:22] questions from the press and media like
[01:12:24] shouldn't you do that if you're the city
[01:12:25] vice president
[01:12:28] she's uh he actually did three last
[01:12:30] Sunday and one today with Meet the Press
[01:12:32] so the quality the qualification of a
[01:12:34] good president is to take an interview
[01:12:37] if you can't take a single question but
[01:12:39] let me ask you this because it's on you
[01:12:41] can what's her greatest accomplishment
[01:12:42] as vice president as vice president
[01:12:45] being the first female all black
[01:12:48] president we've never had no no like I
[01:12:50] got that but like what what's her
[01:12:50] accomplishment that made people's lives
[01:12:52] better I don't know vice presidents
[01:12:53] don't really do much to be honest can
[01:12:55] you name one thing she's done that's
[01:12:56] good no probably
[01:12:59] not thank you the inflation reduction
[01:13:01] act really did that lower
[01:13:11] inflation what's your name Brad Brad
[01:13:14] Brady nice to meet you uh I like the
[01:13:16] idea 30 seconds on 30 seconds off I
[01:13:18] think the best thing I could say about
[01:13:19] this is you have your opinion and I can
[01:13:22] have mine you believe that Donald Trump
[01:13:24] was a good president I maybe don't
[01:13:26] believe that you believe that KLA Harris
[01:13:28] is a Dei candidate for the position of
[01:13:30] President I don't believe that what I'm
[01:13:32] getting to is what do you gain from this
[01:13:35] if I concede and say that KLA Harris is
[01:13:37] a Dei candidate what do you gain because
[01:13:39] I know what it is you're baiting us into
[01:13:41] rage so that you can make money on your
[01:13:43] Tik Tok account you're baiting college
[01:13:44] students all over the world and to
[01:13:46] arguing with you over these fallacies
[01:13:48] you throw a red herring out there and
[01:13:50] you're making money from this account
[01:13:51] well we're sitting here and looking
[01:13:53] stupid first of all I don't control this
[01:13:54] account I'm guest here this is Jubilee
[01:13:56] media and they're going to edit it how
[01:13:57] they see fit okay number one number two
[01:14:00] it needs to be acknowledged that she
[01:14:01] didn't earn it she didn't win a Democrat
[01:14:03] primary she dropped out in the Democrat
[01:14:05] Primary in 2020 she's never been likable
[01:14:08] she's got there simply because of race
[01:14:10] not because of Competency not because
[01:14:12] she's good at her job and I think that's
[01:14:14] wrong and it needs to be called out
[01:14:15] you're bringing up qualitative examples
[01:14:17] these are all subjective qualitative
[01:14:19] examples her race her competency her
[01:14:21] dropping out of the election these
[01:14:24] that's not what you said earlier this is
[01:14:25] I'm talking about the points you've just
[01:14:26] bought up multiple qualitative points
[01:14:28] and these points can be believed by you
[01:14:30] and not by me as you believe in a God
[01:14:31] and I don't these are qualitative
[01:14:33] arguments that you're making against me
[01:14:35] for this and I can believe differently
[01:14:37] than you and I think we can agree to
[01:14:39] disagree on this one okay fine perfect
[01:14:48] okay I think this is going to take the
[01:14:50] entire time you're welcome 30 on 30 off
[01:14:54] how do you feel about the Senate
[01:14:56] uh far as her her tiebreaking vote of
[01:14:58] the Senate no no no I'm just saying like
[01:14:59] Senate like like the Senate is
[01:15:00] technically Dei in a certain sense for
[01:15:02] like small states like Wyoming gets
[01:15:04] people W Wyoming get a greater vot than
[01:15:06] in California like Rhode island in
[01:15:08] Hawaii I'm giving you an example
[01:15:09] California I get less of a vote than
[01:15:11] someone who exists in Wyoming so we're
[01:15:13] giving people in Wyoming more say than
[01:15:15] they necessarily should given that
[01:15:17] they're one individual so why do you
[01:15:18] believe in Dei as it relates to how our
[01:15:20] government is set up we don't believe in
[01:15:21] Dei in terms of allowing for people who
[01:15:24] are black or who are women to be in
[01:15:25] positions of power that they have not
[01:15:26] been allowed in historically speaking so
[01:15:29] um is the electoral college and the
[01:15:31] Senate based on race it's it's
[01:15:33] predicated off of diversity equity and
[01:15:35] inclusion right like inclusion of of of
[01:15:37] country areas inclusion of rural areas
[01:15:40] inclusion of white men like you okay so
[01:15:43] you mean like Hawaii I'm referencing I'm
[01:15:46] referencing you could say smaller States
[01:15:48] or places that have less people in it
[01:15:50] obviously would be able to have more of
[01:15:52] a say per individual so your argument is
[01:15:54] that US Senate is a Dei I I can be
[01:15:56] honest I've never heard that argument
[01:15:57] but I think it's a little silly but how
[01:15:59] is it silly argue against it instead of
[01:16:01] just saying it's silly well right so
[01:16:03] it's silly on its face because first of
[01:16:06] all we have on the House Representatives
[01:16:07] is proportional to
[01:16:09] population but but the Senate isn't so
[01:16:11] it's de it's not Dei yes it is what why
[01:16:14] would you say it's diversity Equity
[01:16:15] inclusions because Wyoming gets two
[01:16:16] senators they're their own sovereign
[01:16:18] state aren they for Country areas for
[01:16:19] rural areas equity for rural areas for
[01:16:23] smaller States so let's go back to the
[01:16:24] Federal papers and the founding fathers
[01:16:26] why was the Senate compos tell me why
[01:16:27] it's not de like under your definition
[01:16:29] why not based on race and by way it does
[01:16:32] have to be based it's not based on
[01:16:33] equity and it's not based on inclusion
[01:16:35] can you have based upon different
[01:16:36] character other than race whether or not
[01:16:38] you're a woman whether or not let let me
[01:16:41] finish why it's because we are a
[01:16:43] collection of States we are not a
[01:16:45] federal project so states rights usurp
[01:16:48] federals do you know what the 17th
[01:16:49] amendment is do you know do you know the
[01:16:50] why the Articles of Confederation failed
[01:16:52] yes but what is the 10th Amendment
[01:16:54] because had to right had too much power
[01:16:56] that's why we specifically aded the let
[01:16:58] me let me make one point okay which is
[01:17:00] how did we us to elect
[01:17:02] Senators it' be population no we used to
[01:17:05] elect Senators based on state
[01:17:06] legislatures so the Senate is an
[01:17:08] extension of the state legislative
[01:17:10] bodies that's not Dei that's federalism
[01:17:13] that's the way that our system is set up
[01:17:15] which is a bottom up citizen-led
[01:17:16] government to allow the states which are
[01:17:19] first and foremost Sovereign so it goes
[01:17:20] in this lad in this country that's still
[01:17:21] de for those States for those country
[01:17:23] areas no because it's blind it's not
[01:17:25] that
[01:17:26] oh is not only based on race hold on a
[01:17:29] second diversity for for Country
[01:17:31] diversity for World equity for World an
[01:17:33] inclusion of that's an inter point is
[01:17:36] only because associate with Harris let
[01:17:38] me ask you a question is there a single
[01:17:39] instance in Corporate America or Dei is
[01:17:41] implemented where diversity means
[01:17:44] anything other than skin color diversity
[01:17:46] so diversity view women women what fine
[01:17:50] how about chromosone or diversity or
[01:17:52] skin color so so so skin color there's
[01:17:54] gender you had to you have to move the
[01:17:55] goal poost a little bit because you got
[01:17:56] destroyed there all right but there's
[01:17:57] also no I'm just asking a very simple
[01:17:59] question the answer is no because our
[01:18:01] system of do mean that's not DEET your
[01:18:03] Senate is Dei what was your definition
[01:18:05] though what what is what was your
[01:18:06] definition diversity Equity inclusion
[01:18:08] diversity doesn't only apply to race
[01:18:09] you're just saying other people definity
[01:18:11] Equity inclusion to be based on race you
[01:18:13] didn't though let me finish because
[01:18:15] you're saying it didn't earn it you know
[01:18:16] who did earn it South Dakota and North
[01:18:17] Dakota when they charted themselves into
[01:18:19] States Wyoming didn't earn it because
[01:18:20] they have less into a state hold on
[01:18:30] all right who really wants to go I I
[01:18:32] don't want to pick on I don't want to
[01:18:33] pick on somebody who doesn't want to get
[01:18:34] picked on
[01:18:35] okay
[01:18:40] um you want to debate wa what is the top
[01:18:44] whatever you want so you're you're the
[01:18:46] affirmative I'm the
[01:18:48] negative yeah let's do it you're good
[01:18:50] with 10 minutes I don't want to put you
[01:18:51] in a spot you don't want to be in no no
[01:18:52] no let's do it let's fun you sure
[01:18:56] [Applause]
[01:19:00] okay okay I guess the claim I'm making
[01:19:03] is that affirmative action is
[01:19:05] constitutional tell me about your plan I
[01:19:07] wanted to talk about affirmative action
[01:19:08] because we haven't really gotten to it
[01:19:10] and it's recently been revoked based on
[01:19:13] the new Supreme Court ruling um and I
[01:19:16] firmly believe that affirmative action
[01:19:18] is constitutional and is a right that
[01:19:21] certain American citizens deserve and I
[01:19:24] just wanted to your thoughts on that um
[01:19:26] well the 14th amendment allows for equal
[01:19:28] protection regardless of race and it's a
[01:19:30] colorblind Amendment and the whole idea
[01:19:32] of affirmative action is to try to give
[01:19:34] people
[01:19:36] extra um boost based on their skin color
[01:19:40] or their racial background which by
[01:19:42] definition Cuts underneath the idea of
[01:19:44] equal protection okay um so do you know
[01:19:47] why the 14th amendment was founded and
[01:19:49] the equal protection and Equal Rights
[01:19:51] Act yeah the 14th amendment was a post
[01:19:52] Civil War amendment 145 167 we all
[01:19:55] during Reconstruction so what was it in
[01:19:57] response to slavery oh and who were
[01:20:00] slaves well that's that's an important
[01:20:02] point so the do you think affirmative
[01:20:04] action will help heal the
[01:20:06] multigenerational problems of slavery I
[01:20:08] do I really do because um so let's just
[01:20:11] talk about the history for a second
[01:20:12] slavery begins in the early 1800s
[01:20:16] earlier no slavery 1816 is the beginning
[01:20:20] of slavy
[01:20:21] 1619 oh yeah I guess it would be okay
[01:20:23] first slaves come in 16 19 doesn't end
[01:20:26] until 1800s 1880s then we go into Jim
[01:20:30] Crow laws starting in
[01:20:31] 1877 and black people are not given
[01:20:35] equal rights until officially 1965 would
[01:20:40] you agree with that that's generally the
[01:20:42] the correct telling yeah so you know
[01:20:44] 1960s 197 just so we're clear that black
[01:20:47] Americans able to serve in office in the
[01:20:49] early 1900s they were able to vote
[01:20:50] throughout the 1900s but yes there were
[01:20:52] pole taxes there was Jim Crow laws there
[01:20:54] was was segregation of course there was
[01:20:56] and we have to be yeah delal not to
[01:20:58] acknowledge those things okay so we can
[01:20:59] acknowledge all of those things can we
[01:21:01] also acknowledge due to the laws under
[01:21:04] Jim Crow that black people were
[01:21:07] significantly hindered from economic
[01:21:09] advancement this is a really important
[01:21:11] question the data shows not really it
[01:21:13] was evil it was terrible but black
[01:21:16] Americans are poor today in 2024 than
[01:21:18] they were in the 1950s yes why do you
[01:21:21] think that is good question so we have
[01:21:22] the Civil Rights Act we have more
[01:21:23] benefits more government programs
[01:21:25] something changed between the 1950s and
[01:21:27] 2024 so there's two answers to this
[01:21:29] question either America got more racist
[01:21:31] since 1950s 2024 so like that 70-year
[01:21:34] period because blacks America black
[01:21:36] Americans are worse off today per capita
[01:21:39] they you agree with that okay good yeah
[01:21:41] than in the 1950s or there's another
[01:21:43] explanation and I think the truth is
[01:21:44] somewhere in the middle which is I think
[01:21:46] you would acknowledge that the The
[01:21:49] Disappearance of the black father has
[01:21:50] been the number one driver of black
[01:21:52] poverty in this country now there are
[01:21:53] reasons for that
[01:21:55] yeah what do you think the reasons for
[01:21:56] that are well culture is one would you
[01:21:58] agree so actually let's go back to the
[01:22:00] foundation prison pipeline all that
[01:22:02] stuff but do at least can we at least
[01:22:04] agree that black dad's not being around
[01:22:06] is a bad thing anyone's father not being
[01:22:09] around is a bad thing of course but 75%
[01:22:11] of black youth are not raised with a
[01:22:12] father in the home it's the highest of
[01:22:14] any group in the country it used to be
[01:22:15] 25% in the 1950s so it's gone up
[01:22:17] dramatically in 70 years okay so you are
[01:22:20] blaming the fact that black people have
[01:22:22] not be able been able to achieve
[01:22:25] economic equality and advancement in
[01:22:28] this country decre specifically and
[01:22:30] solely because of the ABS not solely it
[01:22:33] is the most primary ingredient reason
[01:22:35] most so you think it's the absence of
[01:22:36] black fathers correct and you think what
[01:22:38] else public sector teer unions that have
[01:22:40] kept these schools crummy and kids
[01:22:42] aren't reading and teachers keep getting
[01:22:43] paid we don't fire Bad Teachers that's a
[01:22:45] big thing okay war on police in our
[01:22:46] inner cities and not having enough
[01:22:48] police and not actually put locking up
[01:22:50] criminals let me hear me out for example
[01:22:52] in Chicago do you know that only half of
[01:22:54] all murders go go solved in the city of
[01:22:56] Chicago that doesn't surprise me at all
[01:22:58] that's a problem right that is a problem
[01:22:59] yeah so we need more police more
[01:23:00] detectives to solve those murders but I
[01:23:02] I want to hear your points to I'm
[01:23:03] talking too much so let's go back a
[01:23:06] little bit to what you said in the issue
[01:23:08] of policing now starting in the 1980s
[01:23:11] and continuing onward there's been a War
[01:23:12] on Drugs is this correct I like I like
[01:23:15] the War on Drugs you like the War on
[01:23:17] Drugs so during the War on Drugs it
[01:23:20] created an epidemic of mass
[01:23:22] incarceration specifically
[01:23:25] if you're using drugs no or pedaling
[01:23:27] drugs if you don't use drugs then you
[01:23:29] don't go to jail right so you believe
[01:23:31] that the criminal justice system is
[01:23:33] Flawless no I've never said Flawless
[01:23:34] there's a lot of people in jail that
[01:23:35] shouldn't be in jail there's a lot of
[01:23:36] problems in any system okay so wait
[01:23:38] let's CL on that so you believe that a
[01:23:40] lot of people who have gone to jail
[01:23:42] shouldn't be in jail a small percent
[01:23:43] what percent would you say 5% you would
[01:23:46] say only 5% correct when you have a
[01:23:48] system of justice you're going to have
[01:23:50] scummy prosecutors you're going to have
[01:23:52] bad defense attorneys I have a question
[01:23:53] can I get a Google what percentage of
[01:23:57] people currently incarcerated are black
[01:23:59] it's way larger than well it's hold on
[01:24:01] it's what it's way larger than no I know
[01:24:03] but the fact the fact I'm saying the
[01:24:05] fact I'm saying
[01:24:07] 5% so that's the point that I'm trying
[01:24:09] to make exactly who am I Deb am I
[01:24:11] debating here am I if your own
[01:24:12] government is pumping drugs yeah so wait
[01:24:15] okay so I want to make a quick you're
[01:24:17] right black Americans are in prison far
[01:24:19] greater than the percentage of the
[01:24:20] population so the black Americans about
[01:24:22] 13 to 14% of the population about half
[01:24:24] prisoners are black so blacks commit
[01:24:26] more crimes than whites do they commit
[01:24:28] more murders they commit more arson they
[01:24:30] commit more kidnappings for example
[01:24:32] blacks are 133% of the population and
[01:24:34] they commit 58% of all the murders
[01:24:36] that's not a War on Drugs That's a
[01:24:37] culture problem okay so let's talk about
[01:24:39] that culture black people have been
[01:24:43] legislatively subjugated up until
[01:24:47] 1965 I'll give it I mean honestly it's
[01:24:50] later but let's just say 1965 you do not
[01:24:53] think that that 10 generations of
[01:24:56] legislative subjugation and slavery
[01:24:59] during that time
[01:25:01] 4,000 black men women and children are
[01:25:04] lynched as the result of race riots in
[01:25:07] this country you do not think that these
[01:25:09] things have a lasting effect we have had
[01:25:11] 10 generations of subjugation and four
[01:25:14] of legislative course they have an
[01:25:15] impact but it's more on you to explain
[01:25:17] why things got worse since the Civil
[01:25:19] Rights Act more violent less fathers
[01:25:22] around poorer why is that because of
[01:25:25] mass incarceration and the unfair
[01:25:27] criminalization of black men but let's
[01:25:29] just take murders for example why are
[01:25:31] why blacks are 13% of the population and
[01:25:33] commit 58% of the murders why is that
[01:25:36] because people in affluent and whiter
[01:25:38] neighborhoods are not being policed at
[01:25:40] the same are more I'm talking about dead
[01:25:42] bodies there's no like we're not talking
[01:25:45] about police saying we're talking about
[01:25:45] murders why are so many blacks
[01:25:48] committing murders outside of their
[01:25:49] population okay let's take it back to
[01:25:51] some history I'm curious for an answer
[01:25:53] to that question going to give you one
[01:25:55] so let's go to redlining okay red lining
[01:25:58] red lining yes is why so many blacks are
[01:26:00] killing each other no let me finish my
[01:26:02] claim and then you can respond is that
[01:26:04] okay okay so red lining federally
[01:26:07] mandated or sustained by the FHA right
[01:26:11] separating black Americans to
[01:26:14] specifically impoverished and relegated
[01:26:16] areas of the country we are incapable of
[01:26:19] buying homes and putting Equity into
[01:26:22] neighborhoods with lower crime rates and
[01:26:24] better Educational Systems we do not
[01:26:27] have access to things that would uplift
[01:26:30] and help our community when you are put
[01:26:34] in an
[01:26:36] environment that
[01:26:38] promotes and
[01:26:41] reinforces social and economic
[01:26:45] inequality you become desperate and are
[01:26:47] forced to do things that maybe don't
[01:26:50] align with your values what you're
[01:26:53] making you're making an excuse for a lot
[01:26:56] of murder when you have steal a high
[01:26:59] concentration of a subjugated people in
[01:27:02] one area if you were right when blacks
[01:27:04] in America did not have the same rights
[01:27:06] they had today there were less they were
[01:27:07] less murderous there was less Breakin
[01:27:10] why is that so I'm sorry are you trying
[01:27:12] to say that blacks Thrive under
[01:27:14] subjugation no I'm not I'm saying they
[01:27:15] I'm asking you the question the data
[01:27:17] shows they were actually better in the
[01:27:18] 1940s it was bad it was evil but what
[01:27:21] happened something changed they
[01:27:22] committed less crimes maybe they afraid
[01:27:25] I mean
[01:27:25] 4,000 black men women and children were
[01:27:29] killed in violent Lynch Mark that's your
[01:27:31] explanation but I racial Terror
[01:27:33] permeated American culture for hundreds
[01:27:35] of years Black America is worse than it
[01:27:37] has
[01:27:38] been years the generational psych of an
[01:27:41] entire group of people I'm sure it did
[01:27:43] I'm not discounting that I'm just trying
[01:27:44] to understand why is it the more social
[01:27:46] welfare we've done so we've spent 20
[01:27:47] trillion dollar on uplifting black
[01:27:49] communities 20 trillion and black
[01:27:51] Americans are poor we've done everything
[01:27:53] that's been asked
[01:27:54] you haven't done everything that's been
[01:27:56] asked
[01:27:57] though subsidized housing Medicaid
[01:28:00] public schooling going subsidized
[01:28:03] College we're talking about2 trillion
[01:28:04] have been spent on the Great Society and
[01:28:06] yet Black America is poorer more
[01:28:08] murderous more dangerous so there's an
[01:28:09] explanation I'm asking you we are not
[01:28:11] asking for handouts we are asking for
[01:28:13] equity and part of equity equity mean
[01:28:16] you mean taking from other people excuse
[01:28:18] me it means sharing which is something
[01:28:20] that you guys seem to have a very hard
[01:28:22] time doing sharing so somebody has to
[01:28:24] explain why black America and you
[01:28:26] haven't is 13% of the population and
[01:28:29] commits 58% of the murders black people
[01:28:31] have built and founded the
[01:28:34] society thank
[01:28:38] you I was very smart group very
[01:28:40] opinionate there were a couple other
[01:28:41] people I kind of felt bad for them they
[01:28:42] had a lot of strong opinions but they
[01:28:43] just weren't ready for Prime Time
[01:28:45] overall very good group very impressive
[01:28:46] Republicans tend to just focus on like
[01:28:50] preventing you from arguing your point
[01:28:52] not actually countering the points that
[01:28:53] you come up with he often will switch
[01:28:56] the topic like do a lot of Gish
[01:28:58] Galloping and like kind of filibustering
[01:29:00] to get people to not be able to make the
[01:29:03] points that they want to make and I
[01:29:05] definitely feel like he did that to me
[01:29:07] look Charlie's a talented guy there's a
[01:29:08] reason why he spoke at the RNC he's
[01:29:10] media trained he's had conversations
[01:29:12] like this before and he's built a career
[01:29:14] on dunking on college students but for a
[01:29:16] bunch of liberal students who don't have
[01:29:17] that same type of media training and who
[01:29:19] aren't as prepared to be in
[01:29:21] confrontational formats like this I
[01:29:22] thought they did a really good job of
[01:29:23] our articulating their views yeah Mason
[01:29:25] was the smartest kid for sure uh Parker
[01:29:28] needs to calm down very smart but kept
[01:29:29] on changing the topic uh but he's got
[01:29:31] talent very annoying though smart but
[01:29:33] Annoying Parker definitely gave Charlie
[01:29:35] a run for his money yeah Parker ate
[01:29:37] Parker ate that down one girl was very
[01:29:38] nasty she was a very nasty person she
[01:29:40] overly personalized it I honestly don't
[01:29:42] regret any of the things I said the only
[01:29:44] thing I would have taken back is I said
[01:29:46] at the end I as I walked away I said I
[01:29:48] hope your daughter can get away from you
[01:29:51] that one was a dig and that was my bad
[01:29:53] but honestly in the case of her being a
[01:29:56] 10-year-old pregnant and he won't let
[01:29:58] her get medical help that's just wild to
[01:30:01] me I can't believe that I think the
[01:30:02] group did very great it's a very hard
[01:30:04] environment for people to learn in these
[01:30:06] types of areas but I think it's best
[01:30:08] that people get involved in debate and
[01:30:09] entertainment as it helps people grow
[01:30:11] and critically think in our society I
[01:30:13] thought it was very valuable I hope
[01:30:14] people learned something um I think the
[01:30:15] students were able to refine their
[01:30:16] arguments and hopefully this gets seen
[01:30:18] by millions of people where they're able
[01:30:19] to see what side they land on uh but
[01:30:22] yeah it's not easy just to stand there
[01:30:23] be 20 on one but uh only at Jubilee
[01:30:25] media
