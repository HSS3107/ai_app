[00:00:00] hey guys welcome back to my channel
[00:00:02] welcome back to learn a nutshell so in
[00:00:04] the last video we talked about refund uh
[00:00:06] you know refunding uh
[00:00:08] payment using adn so in this video we'll
[00:00:11] talk about recurring payments so
[00:00:13] recurring payments is you know when
[00:00:15] there is uh
[00:00:16] uh when there is something like a
[00:00:18] recurring uh products which customer
[00:00:20] orders and the payments has to be in a
[00:00:22] process automatically without
[00:00:25] no customer involving again in the
[00:00:27] future orders
[00:00:29] so basically suppose a customer wants to
[00:00:31] order a certain product and he gives the
[00:00:35] authorization order
[00:00:36] to you know
[00:00:38] to process the payment for the future
[00:00:40] payment you know future payments
[00:00:42] so in that case we go for on this
[00:00:45] recurring option so firstly for this
[00:00:48] what you'll have to do is um
[00:00:50] you have to go to additional data under
[00:00:52] developers
[00:00:59] and once you come here
[00:01:01] after search for recurring
[00:01:04] you'll have to enable this recurring
[00:01:05] once you enable this
[00:01:08] should see something like this
[00:01:09] additional data
[00:01:11] uh recurring
[00:01:13] so we'll have to you know uh this is
[00:01:16] required this using this particular
[00:01:18] reference this will be used as a token
[00:01:20] for all the future reference uh you know
[00:01:23] on for all the future
[00:01:25] payments we'll be using this token so
[00:01:27] how this is generated for this first
[00:01:29] we'll have to go to
[00:01:32] on the adn website
[00:01:34] you can open this
[00:01:36] hopefully there's a link
[00:01:50] so
[00:01:51] under tokenization if you come
[00:01:54] so in the main website under online
[00:01:56] payments tokenization create and use
[00:01:58] tokenization
[00:02:00] there are options whether um no it's a
[00:02:02] one-off payment subscription or
[00:02:04] automatic top-ups so when you go for
[00:02:07] subscription we'll have to
[00:02:09] provide the recurring plus model
[00:02:11] processing model variable i know uh for
[00:02:13] that particular key will have to provide
[00:02:15] the value subscription
[00:02:17] and for all the future uh payments
[00:02:19] you'll have to provide the value has
[00:02:23] in the shopper interaction should be uh
[00:02:26] con auth
[00:02:28] and in the initial stage it should be
[00:02:30] e-commerce
[00:02:31] so
[00:02:33] if you see that one let's go and select
[00:02:35] subscription itself
[00:02:37] so this is how it should be for
[00:02:40] the first payment our recurring
[00:02:42] processing model should be subscription
[00:02:44] shopper interaction should be e-commerce
[00:02:47] and we'll have to uh
[00:02:48] get the credit card or whatever details
[00:02:52] they're providing here and store it and
[00:02:56] this is how the response will be
[00:02:58] additional data
[00:03:00] this will be the data which will be
[00:03:01] received this will be not the unique
[00:03:04] token which which we'll be using for all
[00:03:06] the future payments um psp reference
[00:03:10] will be you know unique for each and
[00:03:12] every request
[00:03:15] so
[00:03:16] for all the future uh you know
[00:03:18] transactions we don't have to again pass
[00:03:22] all the credit card details you can just
[00:03:24] provide payment method type scheme which
[00:03:27] we pro provided earlier as well
[00:03:30] and uh
[00:03:31] stored payment id this is where we will
[00:03:34] use the token
[00:03:35] so if you read it it says like um
[00:03:40] stored payment method id this is the
[00:03:42] recurring reference details returned in
[00:03:44] the response when you created the token
[00:03:46] so based on this token only will be you
[00:03:49] know making the or processing the
[00:03:51] payment and this is the order id which
[00:03:53] will be
[00:03:54] uh which will receive from the
[00:03:56] e-commerce and we can put it here or any
[00:03:58] value whichever you want to you know use
[00:04:00] to identify that particular order
[00:04:03] and in shopper interaction we are not
[00:04:05] supposed to give e-commerce now we'll
[00:04:07] have to provide
[00:04:08] continue auth
[00:04:11] so
[00:04:12] recurring processing model will be
[00:04:13] subscription itself
[00:04:15] so what we will do we will try this
[00:04:18] uh problem is scientists are test
[00:04:21] accounts so probably they are not
[00:04:23] they are not supporting this one
[00:04:25] so they're not supposed uh supporting
[00:04:28] the recurring payments so what i'll do
[00:04:30] i'll undo everything
[00:04:32] i'll just go to the initial one
[00:04:37] so this is how the initial
[00:04:40] you know code look like
[00:04:42] so here now we'll provide subscription
[00:04:47] subscription
[00:04:49] for the first payment
[00:04:52] and
[00:04:53] idn payment
[00:04:55] everything is there
[00:04:57] now let's see if this
[00:04:59] works
[00:05:01] so it says that recurring processing
[00:05:04] model is subscription but we are
[00:05:05] supposed to get uh
[00:05:07] liquoring dot you know what is that
[00:05:10] called um
[00:05:12] additional data it is called recurring
[00:05:14] details reference
[00:05:16] we are not getting that maybe because of
[00:05:19] um you know because of the test account
[00:05:22] or else that should have come here and
[00:05:25] for all the future payments we are not
[00:05:27] supposed to pay uh we are not supposed
[00:05:29] to pass e-commerce we'll have to pass
[00:05:32] current
[00:05:33] auth
[00:05:35] let's see what whatever we get
[00:05:40] so let's provide
[00:05:44] on this id itself
[00:05:51] let's provide test so that the
[00:05:55] hopefully this is how we pass for credit
[00:05:58] cards hopefully this should work for
[00:05:59] recurring payments also
[00:06:01] let's see if this works or throw some
[00:06:03] error
[00:06:05] so it says shopper reference is not
[00:06:07] provided so we'll provide the shopper
[00:06:10] reference also
[00:06:14] so let's pass it here and see if this
[00:06:17] solves
[00:06:18] anything
[00:06:20] it says contract not found so basically
[00:06:23] it's not working
[00:06:24] so i tried earlier also so if you have a
[00:06:27] live
[00:06:28] account i know you can try this
[00:06:31] this is how you do this you have to pass
[00:06:33] the token which was generated initially
[00:06:35] here and make all the future payments
[00:06:38] so that's all in this video so this is
[00:06:41] about recurring payments um
[00:06:44] if you like the video hit the like
[00:06:45] button guys please do provide your
[00:06:47] feedback in the comment section uh
