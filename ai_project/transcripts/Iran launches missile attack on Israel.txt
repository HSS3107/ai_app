Description: CNN's Jim Sciutto describes first moments of a recent strike over Tel Aviv.

The Israeli military said on October 1, 2024, that Iran fired missiles and it ordered residents to remain close to bomb shelters as air raid sirens sounded across the country.

Israel and the United States have warned there would be severe consequences in the event of an attack on Israel from Iran, which backs the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The orders to shelter in place were sent to Israelis' mobile phones and announced on national television.

Israeli army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the country's air defense system was fully operational, detecting and intercepting threats. “However, the defense is not hermetic,” he said.

Iranian media began posting videos that appeared to show missile launches at several sites across the country. However, the Iranian government did not immediately acknowledge what was happening.

The air raid alerts in Israel came after a day of rocket and missile attacks from Lebanon, where Israel said it had begun limited ground operations against Hezbollah.

Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire pounded southern Lebanese villages where people were ordered to evacuate, and Hezbollah militants responded by firing a barrage of rockets into Israel. There was no immediate word on casualties as fighting intensified and concerns of a wider regional war grew.

[00:00:19] of this war.

[00:00:23] what we saw, I think, potentially beyond what we saw in April when it,
[00:00:27] when Iran launched dozens of missiles and drones this attack, according to us,
[00:00:33] intelligence
[00:00:35] principally or perhaps entirely ballistic missiles which are the fastest by far
[00:00:41] and the most dangerous.
[00:00:43] Uh And now what we're seeing in addition to those
[00:00:46] intercepts is we're seeing fragments falling to the ground.
