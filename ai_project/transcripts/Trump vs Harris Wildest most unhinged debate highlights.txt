[00:03:37] Guest: is the people on television say my dog
[00:03:39] Guest: was taken and used for food so maybe he
[00:03:42] Guest: said that and maybe that's a good thing

[00:03:46] Guest: this from television people telion their
[00:03:48] Guest: dog was eaten by the people that went
[00:03:51] Guest: there again the Springfield City manager
[00:03:53] Guest: says there's no evidence of that vice
[00:03:54] Guest: president Harris I'll let you respond to
[00:03:56] Guest: the rest of what you've heard you talk
[00:03:58] Guest: about extreme
[00:04:00] Guest: when somebody does a bad job I fire them
[00:04:03] Guest: I think this is so rich coming from
[00:04:06] Guest: someone who has been
[00:04:08] Guest: prosecuted for National Security crimes
[00:04:12] Guest: economic crimes election interference
[00:04:16] Guest: has been found liable for sexual assault
[00:04:20] Guest: and his next big court appearance is in
[00:04:22] Guest: November at his own criminal sentencing
[00:04:25] Guest: excuse me every one of those cases was
[00:04:28] Guest: started by them against their political
[00:04:30] Guest: opponent and then they say oh he was
[00:04:33] Guest: he's a criminal they're the ones that
[00:04:36] Guest: made them go after me they used it to
[00:04:39] Guest: try and win an election fake cases he
[00:04:42] Guest: took a bullet to the head because of the
[00:04:45] Guest: things that they say about me my values
[00:04:48] Guest: have not changed and what is important
[00:04:51] Guest: is that there is a president who
[00:04:53] Guest: actually brings values and a perspective
[00:04:56] Guest: that is about lifting people up and not
[00:04:59] Guest: beating people down and name calling
[00:05:03] Guest: wait a minute I'm talking now if you
[00:05:05] Guest: don't mind please does that sound

[00:05:12] Guest: out I was at the capital on January 6th
[00:05:15] Guest: and on that day the president of the
[00:05:17] Guest: United States incited a violent
[00:05:20] Guest: mob we have a nation that is dying David
[00:05:24] Guest: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million
[00:05:26] Guest: people so let's be clear about that and
[00:05:29] Guest: and clearly he is having a very
[00:05:31] Guest: difficult time processing that and world
[00:05:33] Guest: leaders are laughing at Donald Trump we
[00:05:36] Guest: had no problems when Trump was president
[00:05:39] Guest: but when this weak pathetic man that you
[00:05:42] Guest: saw at a debate just a few months ago

[00:06:16] Guest: we have a president that doesn't know
[00:06:18] Guest: he's alive well first of all it's
