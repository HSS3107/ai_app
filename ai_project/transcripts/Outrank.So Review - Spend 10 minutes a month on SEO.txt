[00:00:00] in today's video we're going to be
[00:00:01] looking at this tool called outrank
[00:00:03] right so this is another AI SEO writing
[00:00:06] tool so the cool thing about this one is
[00:00:09] actually it does a lot of the keyword
[00:00:10] research for you and this content
[00:00:12] planner so when you sign up for this
[00:00:14] tool and I'll leave a link down in the
[00:00:16] first comment if you want to sign up
[00:00:18] there that would be great it's an
[00:00:20] affiliate link so I would earn a
[00:00:21] commission if you do decide we'll go
[00:00:23] into all that now in a second but let's
[00:00:25] look at the tool first to see if this is
[00:00:28] right for you so basically I had to fill
[00:00:30] in some uh form some you know basic
[00:00:33] information about my website and stuff
[00:00:35] like that take the time to do that
[00:00:36] correctly it it it'll take you 10
[00:00:38] minutes okay totally worth it because at
[00:00:40] this point now the tool has you know
[00:00:43] generated all the keywords so it did all
[00:00:45] of this for me right so it's publishing
[00:00:47] one blog post per day right and you can
[00:00:50] see the information about it like so
[00:00:52] here's the first one first keyword that
[00:00:54] I came up with so I did my website which
[00:00:56] is my personal website Conor martin.com
[00:00:59] right so we've got some volume here some
[00:01:02] difficulty and yeah so I talk a little
[00:01:04] bit about SEO and uh you know make money
[00:01:07] online all that stuff so basically it's
[00:01:09] done a lot of the keywords that yeah I'm
[00:01:12] quite interested in to be honest H so
[00:01:15] I'm really happy with the the keywords I
[00:01:17] probably would have done a lot of this
[00:01:19] like to be honest I haven't done any of
[00:01:21] these articles so quite happy that I
[00:01:23] didn't actually go through some of the
[00:01:26] things I've already done which is
[00:01:28] excellent so you can see see there's 30
[00:01:30] articles already um scheduled out for me
[00:01:34] right so you can also change this as
[00:01:36] well like I can see some of them aren't
[00:01:37] very good like I don't really want that
[00:01:39] one that's not going to be helpful for
[00:01:41] me so I'll just uh cancel that one sorry
[00:01:44] so I'll get rid of that one right I
[00:01:46] don't want that one so you just get rid
[00:01:48] of that one that's cool um and one of
[00:01:50] the things is like how it works I really
[00:01:52] think this is amazing to hon I was
[00:01:54] thinking about creating a tool similar
[00:01:56] to this and this is actually done it in
[00:01:58] a better way than I even I planned as
[00:02:00] the scheduler hadn't really planned at
[00:02:01] that part but if you look at this you
[00:02:03] know I've done a lot of SEO and you know
[00:02:05] so many websites I do this all day every
[00:02:08] day so pretty cool the way this works to
[00:02:11] be honest is like finding you know the
[00:02:13] keywords that are selected the system
[00:02:14] works on search volume okay so things
[00:02:16] that are you know has search volume
[00:02:18] keyword difficulty right you want to
[00:02:20] have low keyword difficulty right
[00:02:23] relevance to your target audience
[00:02:24] long-term keywords right super super
[00:02:27] important right and then it's just Artic
[00:02:29] generated published every day right so
[00:02:31] that is really really good I really
[00:02:34] appreciate that and so you can also like
[00:02:36] add keywords here so let's say AO that
[00:02:38] would be you know definitely something
[00:02:40] that I'd be looking for and I can go to
[00:02:42] search there and then they have the
[00:02:44] keyword difficulty and the search volume
[00:02:46] right so you know you just search that
[00:02:48] one and go okay I want that one I i'
[00:02:50] like a few more keywords here but anyway
[00:02:52] that's fine I can just add that and then
[00:02:55] I think that gets added into the space
[00:02:57] that yeah I deleted so really reallyy
[00:03:00] cool but the big question is the actual
[00:03:02] article any good let's have a look at
[00:03:04] the article so yeah we have our featured
[00:03:07] image here and I've integrated it to my
[00:03:10] website so I just set it to publish
[00:03:11] straight away so I can just you know
[00:03:13] don't even have to do anything just one
[00:03:15] article per day so that's really who
[00:03:18] this tool is for right it's kind of a
[00:03:20] bit more expensive right it's like $99
[00:03:22] per month right so it's not for your
[00:03:25] average person right I think this is
[00:03:26] good for a business that's you know
[00:03:28] already making money and just doesn't
[00:03:30] have time for SEO and this will just you
[00:03:32] know gradually consistently build your
[00:03:35] SEO consistency is very hard for SEO to
[00:03:38] just keep publishing these articles
[00:03:40] every day but let's have a look at the
[00:03:42] the article and yeah I'm quite impressed
[00:03:45] with this article I think it's a really
[00:03:47] good the only thing I'd say is like so
[00:03:49] the title here is 10 best SEO competitor
[00:03:52] analysis tools so you know I'd expect a
[00:03:54] list of these tools it doesn't really do
[00:03:57] that it just kind of like okay this is
[00:03:59] you know the tools I probably mentioned
[00:04:00] first when talking about competitive
[00:04:02] analysis would be AHF so you know You'
[00:04:04] like to see that the writing is really
[00:04:06] good but you know I'd probably have
[00:04:08] number one ahfs number two blah blah
[00:04:10] blah and keep on going like that and but
[00:04:12] it hasn't done that don't see that as
[00:04:15] you know you know it's not the worst
[00:04:17] thing in the world but you know if it is
[00:04:18] an actual this should be a listicle
[00:04:20] style article right with that one two
[00:04:22] three four and we haven't done this is
[00:04:23] more just your standard blog post right
[00:04:26] listicles do really really well in
[00:04:28] Google nowadays so definitely still a
[00:04:31] style or format of article you want to
[00:04:33] include in your stuff so yeah it's
[00:04:35] actually included a a relevant video
[00:04:38] right I know this guy Adam enro enroy
[00:04:41] enroy H so yeah you know good video to
[00:04:44] add there and yeah it's quite long got
[00:04:47] you know images I like the images got
[00:04:49] like text which you know usually AI
[00:04:52] images struggle with so they're
[00:04:54] obviously using a good one good image
[00:04:56] generation tool so yeah you know the
[00:04:59] high price
[00:05:00] you know you want to get good quality if
[00:05:01] you're going to be paying this high
[00:05:03] price and what I really like about is
[00:05:05] the hands off right just don't even have
[00:05:07] to do anything you could literally just
[00:05:09] put this into your content planner right
[00:05:12] and then you have all I would spend 10
[00:05:14] minutes checking over these definitely
[00:05:15] you know maybe maybe you just need to
[00:05:17] check these because like I this one was
[00:05:19] written about two or three times so I
[00:05:21] don't want that one so you just X off
[00:05:24] those ones that you don't want right but
[00:05:25] a lot of the other ones I probably
[00:05:27] wouldn't do this best books and SEO that
[00:05:29] wouldn't be you know something that I
[00:05:31] would I would think to do but you know
[00:05:32] maybe if it's just it's going to do it
[00:05:34] for me then you know I don't need to
[00:05:35] think about that I like that so yeah
[00:05:38] affiliate marketing with social media
[00:05:40] again that's not something I'd actually
[00:05:41] thought about so it's actually giving me
[00:05:43] ideas that I hadn't even thought about I
[00:05:45] think about these ideas a lot so that is
[00:05:47] really really good so if you do want to
[00:05:49] go back into the the forms that you
[00:05:51] filled in at the start you just need to
[00:05:52] go into the settings and you can change
[00:05:54] your competitors and all of that so
[00:05:56] basically what I'm saying with this tool
[00:05:58] is you know you can create
[00:06:00] 30 blog posts which is around what I
[00:06:02] would recommend with AI you know one I I
[00:06:04] actually publish sometimes two to five
[00:06:06] blog posts but I've always been a high
[00:06:08] volume publisher I think even before AI
[00:06:10] I was publishing five to 10 blog posts
[00:06:13] per day and that works like crazy for a
[00:06:16] while sometimes you do get smacked down
[00:06:18] by just overp publishing right you do
[00:06:20] need to kind of you know pace yourself a
[00:06:22] little bit so 30 articles per month is a
[00:06:25] really good for most businesses number
[00:06:27] to aim for right so all you need to do
[00:06:29] is set it up for you know 10 minutes at
[00:06:32] the start and then probably 10 minutes a
[00:06:34] month and then your SEO is done this is
[00:06:36] something that I really really agree
[00:06:38] with because SEO is this kind of black
[00:06:40] box and people think it's like this
[00:06:42] secret hack and this you know whatever
[00:06:44] my strategy is you know focus on content
[00:06:47] is like content content content links
[00:06:50] back links and other things are
[00:06:52] important but like you know content is
[00:06:54] the backbone if you're publishing
[00:06:56] content all the time then you're going
[00:06:57] to get traffic you know that's you know
[00:06:59] what people miss a lot of the time they
[00:07:01] think there's all these like little
[00:07:02] check boxes and things that you need to
[00:07:05] do but if you've got things set up right
[00:07:07] from the start and honestly it's not
[00:07:09] that difficult just there's a few little
[00:07:11] things you need to know H to get your
[00:07:13] website set up at the start and then you
[00:07:16] know publish publish publish right it's
[00:07:18] only when your website it has like
[00:07:20] thousands of webs of pages you know at
[00:07:22] that point things can get starting
[00:07:24] getting tricky or if you're like an
[00:07:26] Enterprise or something like that then
[00:07:27] you know you have to do a lot of this
[00:07:29] technical SEO and all these things but
[00:07:32] you can rank on Google and these you
[00:07:34] know chat GPT search engines and all and
[00:07:36] perplexity and all of that with just
[00:07:38] simple blog posts like this I mean
[00:07:41] they're not that simple to create I know
[00:07:42] that a lot of work goes into actually
[00:07:44] even using AI to create these things but
[00:07:47] for you it's pretty simple right so it
[00:07:48] would just be 10 minutes per month which
[00:07:50] is fantastic then you should spend the
[00:07:53] rest of your marketing time on videos
[00:07:56] and social media that's my opinion I
[00:07:59] think SEO is one great marketing channel
[00:08:01] but it's just like something that you
[00:08:03] need to be just doing consistency
[00:08:05] consistently sorry so that's it for this
[00:08:08] video if you want to sign up H I'll
[00:08:10] leave a link down in the description and
[00:08:12] the first comment and thanks for
[00:08:14] watching I definitely recommend this
[00:08:15] tool see you soon
