What Is a Sales Objection
Sales Objection: a reason that prevents a prospect from buying. During your b2b sales meetings, you'll take your prospect through your entire sales process, and towards the end of the meeting, they may have some sales objection. Some examples include: I need to think about it, the price is too high, or I don't think this will work for me. A salesperson's job is to overcome these objections and help the prospect make a buying decision.

Where Do Sales Objections Come From
More sales objections come from any critical info that was not discussed during a sales meeting. But don't look at sales objections as something negative. In fact, it's positive the prospect is telling you exactly why they can't buy your product or service yet. Once you uncover the truth on where this objection is coming from, you can adequately handle it.

How To Handle Any Sales Objection
The three steps to handle any sales objection are 1. Empathize, 2. Get To The Truth and 3. Re-Frame. You'll see a live sales role play where Patrick Dang will be handling a sales objection in our video.

Transcript:

[00:00:00] - In this video you're gonna learn
[00:00:01] how to handle any sales objection
[00:00:03] using my simple three-step framework.
[00:00:07] And you wanna make sure you
watch this video until the end
[00:00:09] because we're also gonna go
through a live sales role-play,
[00:00:13] so you can see this framework in action.
[00:00:15] (soft upbeat music)
[00:00:18] What's going on everybody,
it's Patrick Dang here.
[00:00:19] Before we get started, make
sure to give this video a like,
[00:00:22] subscribe and turn on notifications
[00:00:24] to see more sales videos like this,
[00:00:26] and let's go ahead and get started.
[00:00:28] Now, the first thing we gotta cover
[00:00:29] is what exactly is a sales objection?
[00:00:32] And a sales objection is simply a reason
[00:00:34] for why somebody doesn't want to purchase
[00:00:37] your product and service.
[00:00:38] So for example, you might
be in a sales meeting
[00:00:40] whether it's over the phone, or in person,
[00:00:43] and you ask them questions,
you give a presentation,
[00:00:45] and at the end of everything
you ask for the sale.
[00:00:48] And at the end the prospect
might say something like,
[00:00:50] "Oh, I need to think about it.
[00:00:51] "Oh, the price is too high.
[00:00:53] "Oh, I gotta talk to my boss about this."
[00:00:55] They give you a lot of different reasons
[00:00:57] for why they can't actually buy.
[00:00:59] Now, a prospect, someone
you are trying to sell to,
[00:01:02] they may have an infinite
number of reasons
[00:01:04] for why they can't buy.
[00:01:06] So it's your job as a seller
[00:01:08] to uncover the truth behind
why they're not buying,
[00:01:11] and remove that blocker,
[00:01:13] and help them make a purchasing decision.
[00:01:15] Now, where do sales
objections really come from?
[00:01:19] In no matter what it
is that you're selling,
[00:01:21] whether you're in sales,
business development,
[00:01:22] or if you're an entrepreneur,
[00:01:23] sales objections are going
to come from anything
[00:01:26] that wasn't discussed in
the actual sales meeting.
[00:01:28] So think about this,
[00:01:29] when you are let's say
selling something, right?
[00:01:31] And you are in a sales meeting,
[00:01:33] you're basically having a conversation
[00:01:34] and convincing the person
[00:01:35] why they should purchase
your product and service.
[00:01:38] Now, an objection is gonna
come at the end usually,
[00:01:41] because maybe something wasn't covered,
[00:01:43] maybe you didn't talk
about the approval process
[00:01:45] they have to go through to buy
[00:01:47] whatever it is you're selling.
[00:01:48] Or maybe you didn't talk about
the budget quite yet, right?
[00:01:51] So, if you didn't cover those
things in the sales meeting,
[00:01:54] eventually they're going to turn up.
[00:01:56] And so, ideally, you would
want to handle objections
[00:01:58] during the sales meeting,
[00:01:59] but sometimes you might miss something
[00:02:01] or maybe the prospect doesn't tell you
[00:02:03] all the information you
need during that meeting,
[00:02:05] so it comes up at the end.
[00:02:07] But the thing you want
to pay attention to,
[00:02:09] is that a sales objection
[00:02:11] is not necessarily a bad thing, right?
[00:02:13] You might think of it
as a bad thing because,
[00:02:14] oh, someone doesn't wanna
buy your product service.
[00:02:17] However, you wanna look at
it and re-frame the situation
[00:02:20] as an opportunity to
help the customer buy.
[00:02:23] Let's say, someone's trying to get
[00:02:24] from point A to point B, right?
[00:02:26] Like you're walking across the road,
[00:02:27] but an objection comes in the
middle, it's like an obstacle.
[00:02:30] They're trying to walk through,
[00:02:31] and something, for some
reason, they get blocked.
[00:02:33] And it's your job to remove this obstacle,
[00:02:35] so they can walk from point A to point B.
[00:02:38] And if you think about
it in that perspective,
[00:02:41] an objection is not really a bad thing,
[00:02:42] it's just a reason for why
somebody can't buy yet.
[00:02:45] So instead of pushing someone in to buy,
[00:02:47] just remove the obstacle
[00:02:48] and help them make the
purchasing decision.
[00:02:50] Because they already wanna
go from point A to point B,
[00:02:52] you're just unblocking them.
[00:02:54] So, now, let's go ahead
[00:02:55] and get into the three-step framework
[00:02:57] on how to actually handle the objection.
[00:03:00] So, typically in sales training,
[00:03:02] what people have you do is they will,
[00:03:04] let's say, give you all
the common objections
[00:03:06] and then you have to memorize
a script to handle each one.
[00:03:08] For example, the price is too high,
[00:03:10] I already work for my competitor.
[00:03:12] So, traditionally you would
have a immediate response
[00:03:14] to whatever it is, right?
[00:03:16] But, and that does work,
[00:03:17] and you should have responses
to the very common objections.
[00:03:20] But what happens when you
come across an objection
[00:03:22] that let's say, you have never heard of,
[00:03:24] how do you handle an objection
that you didn't prepare for?
[00:03:27] And so this three-step framework,
[00:03:28] you can basically use
for any type of objection
[00:03:32] whether you have already heard it,
[00:03:33] or it's gonna be a brand new one
[00:03:35] and you're gonna be able
[00:03:35] to use this objection-handling
technique on the fly
[00:03:38] for any type of objection.
[00:03:40] All right, so the three-step
framework you're gonna use
[00:03:42] is empathize, get to the truth
[00:03:45] and re-frame the conversation.
[00:03:47] So empathy is kinda understanding
[00:03:49] where the person is coming from
[00:03:50] and really seeing things
from their perspective,
[00:03:52] and making the prospect feel heard.
[00:03:55] It is very important to
build trust and rapport.
[00:03:57] The next step when
you're seeking the truth
[00:03:59] is when someone gives you an objection
[00:04:01] you wanna dive a little bit deeper,
[00:04:03] into what is the real,
real, real objection, right?
[00:04:06] Because the first thing somebody says
[00:04:07] usually is partially true,
[00:04:10] and you wanna dive a
little deeper to understand
[00:04:12] why someone really, cannot
buy right now, right?
[00:04:15] And I'll show you an example of that.
[00:04:16] And the final step is going to re-frame.
[00:04:18] So you wanna re-frame the conversation,
[00:04:20] so instead of, looking at an objection
[00:04:23] from a traditional standpoint,
[00:04:24] you wanna change that and you
wanna see these objections
[00:04:27] as opportunities to help
educate your customer,
[00:04:30] and help them make a purchasing decision.
[00:04:32] So let's go ahead and
get into the role-play,
[00:04:34] so you see how this all works.
[00:04:37] - [John] Patrick, everything
looks good so far,
[00:04:40] but let me think about it.
[00:04:42] - Okay, John, I hear what you're saying.
[00:04:44] I'm guessing you wanna take your time
[00:04:46] before making an important
decision like this, right?
[00:04:49] - [John] Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:50] - Okay, well, hey, since
we are already talking
[00:04:52] over the phone, John, I'm curious,
[00:04:55] I know you don't wanna rush anything here,
[00:04:56] but I wanted to know exactly,
[00:04:59] what exactly you need to think about
[00:05:00] before making a decision.
[00:05:02] Maybe I can help answer
any questions you have
[00:05:04] while we're talking right now.
[00:05:05] - [John] Yeah, so, like I said before,
[00:05:07] everything looks good, but I
can't actually buy this myself.
[00:05:12] I have to talk it over with my boss,
[00:05:14] and she's actually the one
that signs off on everything.
[00:05:18] - Okay, that totally makes sense.
[00:05:19] Hey, you know, if it's easier for you,
[00:05:21] how about we schedule a call with you,
[00:05:23] and your boss and myself,
[00:05:24] and we can talk through the details.
[00:05:27] This way I can be there to help answer
[00:05:28] any questions your boss may have,
[00:05:31] instead of you having to
do it all by yourself.
[00:05:32] How does that sound?
[00:05:33] - [John] Okay, yeah, sure.
[00:05:35] That would actually make
things a lot easier for me.
[00:05:38] - So, in the role-play you
can kinda see that, John,
[00:05:41] it was at the end of the
meeting and John wanted to buy,
[00:05:43] but then for some reason he couldn't.
[00:05:45] And so I had to empathize with
him and I understood like,
[00:05:48] "Hey, you don't have to rush anything."
[00:05:50] But, the next step is I
need to get to the truth.
[00:05:53] Why exactly is he not buying?
[00:05:55] What does he need to think about, right?
[00:05:57] And so I asked, and I said,
[00:05:58] "Hey, what exactly do
you need to think about?
[00:06:00] "You can ask it directly like that."
[00:06:02] And John says, Oh, he needs
to talk it over with his boss,
[00:06:05] because the boss is the one
that signs off on it, right?
[00:06:08] And maybe he didn't tell me that
[00:06:09] in the beginning of the
meeting, but now I know.
[00:06:11] So knowing this, what I need to do
[00:06:13] is I need to re-frame the conversation,
[00:06:15] and schedule another meeting
[00:06:16] with him and his boss and myself,
[00:06:18] so I can talk about my solution.
[00:06:19] And I know that I don't want
John to do it by himself
[00:06:22] because when it comes to selling,
[00:06:23] John cannot sell my
product better than I can,
[00:06:25] because I'm the sales person, right?
[00:06:27] He can kinda relay the message,
[00:06:28] but he won't be as persuasive.
[00:06:31] So that's why I need to
schedule another meeting,
[00:06:33] so I can talk to the person
[00:06:34] who's really gonna make
the decision on that call,
[00:06:37] and persuade them and explain to them
[00:06:39] why they need to purchase
my product or service.
[00:06:41] And so that's pretty much the framework,
[00:06:43] empathize, seek the truth
[00:06:44] and then re-frame the conversation.
