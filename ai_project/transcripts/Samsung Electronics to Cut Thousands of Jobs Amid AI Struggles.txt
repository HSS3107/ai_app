[00:00:00] We lead the revolution making such a
difference for so many companies.
[00:00:03] What else do we know about these layoffs
for Samsung?
[00:00:08] Well, the layoffs we're hearing relate
to the overseas subsidiaries in
[00:00:11] particular.
So we're not talking about the
[00:00:13] headquarters in Korea, but it does
actually affect possibly.
[00:00:17] Well, there are 150,000 staff overseas,
and that's more than half of Samsung's
[00:00:21] entire workforce.
Are the markets, though, where job
[00:00:24] losses are occurring this time we're
hearing are Australia and New Zealand
[00:00:28] and also Southeast Asia?
And about 10% of the market or the
[00:00:32] workforce in those markets could end up
being affected, though the numbers are
[00:00:35] likely to vary among each subsidiary as
well.
[00:00:38] We are hearing, though that they have
got underway, so some of our colleagues,
[00:00:42] for instance, have spoken to someone
familiar in Singapore and they're saying
[00:00:46] that on Tuesday.
So just yesterday different people were
[00:00:49] being pulled into meetings with John,
with the reporting managers, and shared
[00:00:53] what would end up being their severance
or their retrenchment packages.
[00:00:59] We've also heard that Samsung has been
laying off other staff recently.
[00:01:04] Yes, we've had other reporting on this
as well of late.
[00:01:07] Those positions could have been
eliminated in India and also parts of
[00:01:11] Latin America.
It is important, though, to reflect on
[00:01:14] the types of positions that are being
eliminated.
[00:01:16] So we're not talking about manufacturing
roles.
[00:01:18] Actually, we're hearing that Samsung is
really trying to keep those.
[00:01:21] What is the focus is management and also
some support functions.
[00:01:25] It is an interesting moment for Samsung.
I mean, this chart here puts it in
[00:01:29] perspective.
You're looking at a more than 20% drop
[00:01:31] for the company versus what we've seen
from other high flying tech companies
[00:01:36] this year.
I mean, it's really had quite a
[00:01:38] different tale.
What is leading some of those issues for
[00:01:42] Samsung is the perception that it's
falling behind in key markets.
[00:01:45] So
HBM, for instance, is frequently cited,
[00:01:48] high bandwidth memory chips.
And this is really key to powering
[00:01:52] tools.
Samsung is really playing catch up to SK
[00:01:55] Hynix here in Korea in this key area.
It's also trying to build out its
[00:01:59] foundry business, compete with the likes
of TSMC, but it's still a very far cry
[00:02:03] from doing just that.
