Transcript:

[00:00:00] >> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY.
[00:00:01] WE ARE BACK WITH BILL GATES.
YOU HAVE A NEW NETFLIX
[00:00:05] DOCUSERIES THAT'S CALLED "WHAT'S
NEXT, THE FUTURE WITH
[00:00:10] BILL GATES" IN ONE EPISODE THAT
FASCINATED ME WAS YOU TALK TO
[00:00:13] BERNIE SANDERS.
BERNIE SANDERS DOES NOT SAY
[00:00:14] GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE FACT THAT
THERE ARE BILLIONAIRES.
[00:00:17] HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE
IS ANY REASON THAT THERE SHOULD
[00:00:21] BE BILLIONAIRES.
HOW DO YOU --
[00:00:23] SOME PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM RIGHT
HERE.
[00:00:26] WHAT IS IT LIKE HANGING WITH
BERNIE FOR YOU?
[00:00:30] >> WELL, HE IS KIND OF
PREDICTABLE, YOU KNOW, HE WISHES
[00:00:35] WE WERE RICH ENOUGH THAT WE
COULD BE MORE GENEROUS.
[00:00:38] AND SO YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU
RAISE THAT REVENUE WITHOUT
[00:00:46] DESTROYING THE CAPITALISTIC
SYSTEM THAT MAKES THE U.S. THE
[00:00:49] ENVY OF THE WORLD.
FOR THAT EPISODE ON INEQUALITY,
[00:00:53] I TALKED TO MITT ROMNEY, I
TALKED TO BERNIE SANDERS.
[00:00:56] I GET THESE DIFFERENT
VIEWPOINTS.
[00:00:58] I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD MAKE THE
TAX SYSTEM MORE PROGRESSIVE.
[00:01:04] I WOULD'VE PAID TWICE AS MUCH IN
BILLIONAIRE.
[00:01:10] SO HE WOULD GET RID OF 99% OF MY
MONEY.
[00:01:13] I WOULD ONLY GET RID OF 50% OF
IT.
[00:01:16] >> Stephen: BUT 99% OF YOUR
MONEY, YOU WOULD STILL BE A
[00:01:21] MULTIBILLIONAIRE.
$138 BILLION, I CAN DO THE MATH.
[00:01:26] >> Bill: IF YOU GET RID OF
99%, I WOULD HAVE $1.3 BILLION.
[00:01:31] >> Stephen: I AM SO SORRY.
[LAUGHTER]
[00:01:37] I WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE TO HAVE
ONLY $1.3 BILLION.
[00:01:45] ARE WE TALKING MARK CUBAN MONEY
HERE.
[00:01:48] LOVE YOU, MARK.
DO YOU THINK I WOULD ENJOY BEING
[00:01:54] A BILLIONAIRE?
>> Bill: YES.
[00:01:55] >> Stephen: YOU THINK I WOULD
ENJOY IT?
[00:01:58] I AM TELLING YOU FOR THE LOW,
LOW PRICE OF $1 BILLION I AM
[00:02:02] WILLING TO DISAGREE WITH
BERNIE SANDERS RIGHT HERE.
[00:02:04] WHAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUT
BEING A BILLIONAIRE?
[00:02:07] >> Bill: TWO THINGS.
ONE IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[00:02:10] WORRY.
YOU CAN SEND YOUR KIDS TO ANY
[00:02:13] SCHOOL.
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY
[00:02:16] PROBLEMS, AND IF YOU ARE
CHARITABLY MINDED, THEN YOU CAN
[00:02:19] PICK THINGS YOU BELIEVE IN,
MALNUTRITION, WHATEVER IT IS YOU
[00:02:22] WANT TO WORK ON AND YOU CAN BE
INCREDIBLY GENEROUS AND HELP.
[00:02:29] [APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: YOU ARE PLANNING
[00:02:30] ON GIVING MOST OF THE MONEY
AWAY?
[00:02:33] YOU AND A BUNCH OF OTHER
BILLIONAIRES HAVE THIS CHARITY
[00:02:36] PLEDGE THAT YOU SIGNED.
WHAT IS THE PLEDGE SAY?
[00:02:39] >> Bill: IT'S CALLED THE
GIVING PLEDGE, I HAVE COMMITTED
[00:02:42] TO GIVE OVER 95% OF MY MONEY
AWAY TO JOIN THE PLEDGE YOU ONLY
[00:02:46] HAVE TO COMMIT TO GIVE THE
MAJORITY AWAY.
[00:02:50] >> Stephen: 51% AND ABOVE.
>> Bill: THAT'S IT.
[00:02:54] IT'S BEEN ON A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISING AI,
[00:02:59] DOESN'T FRIGHTEN YOU?
>> Bill: SOMEWHAT.
[00:03:01] >> Stephen: WHAT WORRIES YOU?
A ROBOT OVERLORD, OR THE FACT
[00:03:04] THAT WE WILL GET INTELLECTUALLY
LAZY, AND IT WILL STOP BECAUSE
[00:03:08] WE ARE OUTSOURCING TO A MACHINE?
>> Bill: IT IS THE FIRST
[00:03:13] TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS NO LIMIT.
WHEN YOU INVENT A TRACKER OR
[00:03:17] CELL PHONE, YOU FIGURE OUT,
OKAY, WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW
[00:03:21] THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE LIFE.
HERE WHERE THE AI IS VERY
[00:03:26] INTELLIGENT AND WHEN YOU PUT A
ROBOTIC FORMULA, IT CAN DO A LOT
[00:03:30] A BLUE-COLLAR AND WHITE-COLLAR
JOBS, THE FACT THAT THAT IS
[00:03:34] HAPPENING OVER THE NEXT DECADE,
THE IDEA OF DOING REALLY TRUST
[00:03:38] GOVERNMENT TO ADJUST THE TAX
POLICIES AND MAKE SURE THAT
[00:03:41] OKAY, WE ARE SHORTENING THE WORK
WEEK, SO THAT IT IS HAPPENING
[00:03:45] VERY FAST AND IT IS UNLIMITED.
A LOT OF IT IS SUPER GOOD.
[00:03:50] LIKE, YOU KNOW, INNER-CITY
PERSONAL TUTORS FOR ALL OF THE
[00:03:55] KIDS.
GREAT HEALTH CARE, EVEN IN POOR
[00:03:58] COUNTRIES.
SO THE GOOD STUFF, WHICH MAYBE
[00:04:02] GETS CROWDED OUT BY THESE FEARS,
THAT'S SO EXCITING.
[00:04:07] >> Stephen: THAT'S NOT A
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.
[00:04:10] IT IS AI THAT REMINDS ME OF THE
CRUEL EXPERIENCES WITH THE BABY
[00:04:14] MONKEYS THAT HAD A BOTTLE
WRAPPED UP IN CARPET TO SIMULATE
[00:04:18] MOMMY AND I'LL BOTTLE ON A WIRE
FRAME, AND THEY GOT FOOD, BUT
[00:04:24] THE WIREFRAME MONKEYS DIED FROM
THE LACK OF WARMTH FROM THE
[00:04:27] PHYSICAL MOTHER.
AN AI TEACHER IS NOT A HUMAN
[00:04:30] BEING WHO CAN PERCEIVE MY NEEDS.
AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO
[00:04:34] BEDSIDE MANNER, ISN'T THERE A
LITTLE BIT OF A DANGER THERE?
[00:04:39] >> Bill: PROBABLY NOT.
[LAUGHS]
[00:04:44] >> Stephen: I HAD EXAMPLES.
YOU JUST SAID "NO."
[00:04:50] [APPLAUSE]
>> Bill: THE IDEAL FOR
[00:04:52] LEARNING IS TO HAVE A PERSONAL
TUTOR WHO UNDERSTANDS YOUR
[00:04:55] MOTIVATION, WHO IS SEEING WHAT
YOU ARE GETTING RIGHT AND WRONG,
[00:04:59] AND THE AI CAN LEARN FROM THE
VERY BEST PERSONAL TUTORS.
[00:05:04] UNTIL YOU USE THIS STUFF, IT IS
PRETTY SURPRISING.
[00:05:08] IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I
FIRST SAW THIS ChatGPT AND IT
[00:05:11] WAS KIND OF MIND-BLOWING,
BECAUSE IT CAME ALL OF A SUDDEN.
[00:05:17] AND YES, ITS ABILITY TO LEARN
FROM THE BEST AND PROVIDE
[00:05:21] ADVICE.
AND BE THERE 24 HOURS A DAY,
[00:05:23] HAVE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH ADVISER
24 HOURS A DAY, YOUR PERSONAL
[00:05:29] TUTOR MEET AND GIVE YOU
FEEDBACK, IT IS -- THERE'S BEEN
[00:05:34] A LOT OF SCIENCE MOVIES LIKE
"HER" WHERE YOU REALLY ARE
[00:05:39] CONNECTED.
>> Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH FOR
[00:05:41] STOPPING BY AND YOUR EFFORTS TO
MAKE IT A BETTER PLANET!
[00:05:44] YOU CAN READ THE 2024
"GOALKEEPERS" REPORT
[00:05:49] ON THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES
FOUNDATION WEBSITE.
[00:05:53] BILL GATES, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JANE
[00:05:56] GOODALL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
