Description: Today's protagonists are Saleh and Ted from Gravity Climate. Saleh made a name for himself as a skilled product manager at named startups like Salesforce and Samsara, while Ted dropped out of college at a young age and dove straight into the startup world. Gravity Climate began with the question: Why do companies find it so difficult to measure their carbon footprint? Through hypothesis testing, they started with just a few lines of simple code and gathered a cohort of 10 people from their network. Now in its second year, Gravity Climate continues to grow two to three times annually. Let's take a closer look at their product approach!

[00:00:00] any product kind of goes through a few
[00:00:02] phases first one is like selling on
[00:00:04] Vision the next one is really selling on
[00:00:06] a presentation the pilot program was
[00:00:09] somewhere between those two we went to
[00:00:11] people and we said for 3 months we will
[00:00:12] do X in this case was help you submit a
[00:00:15] report to a requesting body in real time
[00:00:18] we were basically building software and
[00:00:19] answering the questions that they had
[00:00:21] around how to measure their scope one
[00:00:22] emissions or their scope two emissions
[00:00:24] completely informed by this first cohort
[00:00:26] as a startup you have so few resources
[00:00:29] and you really can't afford to spend
[00:00:31] spare calories trying to pursue unknown
[00:00:34] return on investment experimenting with
[00:00:36] powerful new databases in my opinion is
[00:00:38] a luxury for people who have more time
[00:00:41] and money to burn it's important to pick
[00:00:42] boring technology hi my name is Salah
[00:00:45] I'm the CEO gravity an industrial
[00:00:47] decarbonization platform we help people
[00:00:49] manage their carbon and manage their
[00:00:50] energy gravity is tackling climate
[00:00:52] change in a scalable way and then
[00:00:55] identify plan and execute real world
[00:00:57] projects to reduce those things last
[00:00:59] year was our second year in existence
[00:01:01] and we grew about four times and this
[00:01:02] year we're on track to about 3 3 and
[00:01:04] 1/2x again which is really
[00:01:07] [Music]
[00:01:21] exciting in college I started off by
[00:01:23] studying physics I ended up graduating
[00:01:25] with a degree in computer Science and
[00:01:27] Mathematics computer science to me was
[00:01:29] the application of math in software
[00:01:32] while physics was the application of
[00:01:33] math to the physical world and uh I
[00:01:35] would say that was kind of the beginning
[00:01:36] of marrying Adams and bits for me so
[00:01:39] fresh out of college I went to a company
[00:01:41] called Salesforce I landed as a software
[00:01:43] engineer there on a team called the iot
[00:01:45] cloud I fell in love with it but my
[00:01:47] favorite times were when we were
[00:01:48] building prototypes and we actually had
[00:01:50] the physical products in our hands and
[00:01:51] so I knew that I wanted to get closer to
[00:01:53] it and so in leaving Salesforce I looked
[00:01:55] to a company called samsar one of the
[00:01:57] most incredible sales machines and go to
[00:01:58] market machines and I them to spearhead
[00:02:01] a product line they called Safety Safety
[00:02:03] was expanding Beyond fuel efficiency and
[00:02:05] GPS tracking and a number of other
[00:02:07] classical telematics offerings into dash
[00:02:09] cameras and safety monitoring in leaving
[00:02:11] samsara I joined an industrial Venture
[00:02:13] Capital firm called Eclipse joined them
[00:02:15] as an entrepreneur and residence
[00:02:17] incubating a number of different ideas
[00:02:18] but the thesis that I really started to
[00:02:20] obsess over was one that centered around
[00:02:22] the ground swell in both actions and
[00:02:25] technologies that energy intensive
[00:02:27] companies could take that were carbon
[00:02:28] reductive but also incredibly aligned to
[00:02:32] competitive business metrics and so
[00:02:33] there was a lot of opportunity for them
[00:02:34] to take action that was aligned to
[00:02:36] climate what really itched me though was
[00:02:38] that increasingly these entities were
[00:02:40] being pressured to disclose or even
[00:02:42] lambasted for being carbon intensive by
[00:02:45] a lot of people who were eagerly pushing
[00:02:47] forward the climate agenda they had this
[00:02:49] incredible opportunity to participate uh
[00:02:51] and weren't doing so I had known solid
[00:02:54] socially for several years he was always
[00:02:56] somebody that I had wanted to start a
[00:02:58] company with and then in late 2021 he
[00:03:01] called me from a very crowded hostel in
[00:03:04] Glasgow he was out there for cop 26 the
[00:03:07] climate conference he told me about how
[00:03:09] he had been an entrepreneur in Residence
[00:03:10] at Eclipse Ventures and at Eclipse he
[00:03:13] had been incubating a thesis about
[00:03:15] pragmatic decarbonization he walked me
[00:03:17] through his thesis and it was like
[00:03:19] getting struck with a bolt of lightning
[00:03:20] I knew that if I didn't leave to pursue
[00:03:22] this opportunity with him I would
[00:03:24] probably come to regret it I learned how
[00:03:26] to code when I was seven around senior
[00:03:29] year of high school interned at a
[00:03:30] company called ibata which is B Toc a
[00:03:33] consumer couponing application and it
[00:03:35] was 20 people in the basement of a
[00:03:37] firehouse in Denver that was the summer
[00:03:39] that iata hit a million users and it was
[00:03:41] just intoxicating seeing us build
[00:03:43] something put it out there watching it
[00:03:45] grow in real time and then I went to
[00:03:47] college for a year I actually dropped
[00:03:49] out of college after freshman year I
[00:03:51] think because I had such a good
[00:03:52] experience at ibata when my friend
[00:03:54] called me and said hey I want to drop
[00:03:56] out of Stanford and start an analytics
[00:03:58] company I said that sounds awesome so
[00:04:00] both my parents are Educators and I
[00:04:02] remember talking to them and saying hey
[00:04:04] I have a once in a-lifetime opportunity
[00:04:06] to move to California and work on this
[00:04:08] company and my mom said you're 19 what
[00:04:10] do you know about once in A- lifetime
[00:04:12] opportunities which I think is a very
[00:04:13] fair point company that I joined after
[00:04:15] freshman year of college was called
[00:04:17] clear graph clear graph was an analytics
[00:04:19] company so we built a natural language
[00:04:21] search tool kind of like Siri but for
[00:04:23] structured data worked at that company
[00:04:25] for several years and got an acquisition
[00:04:27] offer from Tableau so we sold that
[00:04:29] compan to Tableau in 2017 and then I
[00:04:31] stayed there for a couple years one
[00:04:33] thing I learned was that it's very
[00:04:35] important to Niche down for a Target
[00:04:38] customer at Clear graph I think one of
[00:04:39] the challenges we had was the long-term
[00:04:41] ambition was to make data accessible to
[00:04:44] all manner of business users who
[00:04:45] couldn't currently access it but because
[00:04:47] of how broad that ambition was we ended
[00:04:49] up building a product that was quite
[00:04:51] horizontal it wasn't specialized in the
[00:04:53] ways that it needed to be specialized
[00:04:55] and because it was trying to be
[00:04:56] everything to everybody it ended up
[00:04:58] having a lot of trouble adding value
[00:05:00] whatsoever and so if I could go back I
[00:05:02] would have niched down earlier for Clear
[00:05:04] graph we also learned a lot about the
[00:05:06] right way to build software at an early
[00:05:08] stage company we made some decisions
[00:05:10] that really slowed us down like
[00:05:12] splitting the codebase into
[00:05:14] microservices and that sort of thing and
[00:05:16] having the learnings from Clear graph
[00:05:18] definitely influenced the way that we
[00:05:19] operate engineering and product here at
[00:05:24] gravity gravity was born out of the
[00:05:27] thesis that a lot of this growing meure
[00:05:30] that energy or carbon intensive
[00:05:31] companies were feeling to disclose or
[00:05:33] participate in the climate transition
[00:05:35] was rooted in software not being built
[00:05:37] to make that process easier and business
[00:05:40] dots not being connected to make that
[00:05:41] more attractive there's got to be some
[00:05:43] Missing Link rather than having an arm
[00:05:45] twist to pull these people into the
[00:05:46] climate transition we could incentivize
[00:05:48] it it could be attractive we help
[00:05:50] companies measure their carbon footprint
[00:05:52] and energy usage and then identify plan
[00:05:55] and execute real world projects to
[00:05:57] reduce those things the actual math of
[00:05:59] carbon accounting is quite simple you
[00:06:00] need to figure out all the things that a
[00:06:02] business does and then you need to
[00:06:04] figure out how much carbon they Emit and
[00:06:05] then you multiply the quantities by the
[00:06:07] emission factors and then you sum it up
[00:06:09] and that's a carbon footprint but the
[00:06:11] art of building a good carbon counting
[00:06:13] product actually has mostly to do with
[00:06:15] the inputs and the outputs how do you
[00:06:17] get the right data in from the Myriad
[00:06:19] sources throughout a business throughout
[00:06:21] a business's supply chain where it needs
[00:06:22] to come from how do you output it and
[00:06:24] report it in the format that is useful
[00:06:26] that lets a business accomplish its
[00:06:27] goals we built the first version of the
[00:06:29] product really fast uh we were in the
[00:06:31] Market within a month or two of getting
[00:06:33] going we've been generating revenue from
[00:06:35] about that time as well and I think that
[00:06:38] has done really well for us because more
[00:06:40] important than the early Revenue has
[00:06:41] been the feedback and The Real World
[00:06:43] customer Pain any product kind of goes
[00:06:45] through a few phases before it ends up
[00:06:48] becoming the actual costed and sold by
[00:06:51] many sales reps effort first one is like
[00:06:53] selling on vision and that is often to
[00:06:57] new hires that's often to investors that
[00:06:59] next one is really selling on a
[00:07:01] presentation to an extent and so you
[00:07:03] actually go to a buyer and you share a
[00:07:05] slide deck of could be features but you
[00:07:08] pitch them as existing and you try to
[00:07:09] attach some sort of a cost to it the
[00:07:11] pilot program was somewhere between
[00:07:14] those two we went to people and we said
[00:07:15] for 3 months we will do X in this case
[00:07:18] was help you submit a report to a
[00:07:20] requesting body we'll come measure your
[00:07:22] missions efficiently we'll do it through
[00:07:23] the software powered experience and
[00:07:25] we'll generate a report that you could
[00:07:26] share with either your shareholders your
[00:07:28] largest customers or if you were in a
[00:07:30] regulatory Market you could share it to
[00:07:31] a regulatory so the pilot program was
[00:07:33] minimally finding 10 customers is what
[00:07:35] we wanted to do we wanted them to be a
[00:07:37] mix of different organization sizes and
[00:07:39] a mix of going directly to those
[00:07:40] Industrials as well as some private
[00:07:42] Equity firms just to get a feel for like
[00:07:44] the two-sided Market that we were
[00:07:45] starting to see for during that time
[00:07:47] I'll be honest we had only a few lines
[00:07:49] of code and a lot of hypotheses but in
[00:07:52] the spirit of if they come we will build
[00:07:54] it we wanted to be very reactive to the
[00:07:57] initial demands of these organizations
[00:07:59] in real time we were basically building
[00:08:01] software and answering the questions
[00:08:02] that they had around how to measure
[00:08:04] their scope one emissions or their scope
[00:08:05] two emissions thinking about what
[00:08:07] Integrations what automations we wanted
[00:08:09] to actually build completely informed by
[00:08:11] this first cohort of course there's risk
[00:08:12] there that if you choose a cohort that's
[00:08:15] not representative of the rest of the
[00:08:16] market you've built something tailored
[00:08:17] to them and no one else but we tried to
[00:08:19] figure out the lowest common
[00:08:20] denominators that were highly useful and
[00:08:23] at the end of those three months as was
[00:08:24] kind of communicated early on to those
[00:08:26] organizations we said you have the right
[00:08:27] to walk away there's no kind of
[00:08:29] commitment to purchase or if you'd like
[00:08:31] to continue with us here's a highly kind
[00:08:33] of discounted early partner rate um we'd
[00:08:35] love to work with you and over 50% of
[00:08:37] that cohort converted and so the pilot
[00:08:40] program ended up being really impactful
[00:08:41] for us we got revenue in the door within
[00:08:43] the first four months of our existence
[00:08:45] which was astonishing and we built the
[00:08:47] product rapidly in reaction to explicit
[00:08:50] customer feedback and had all these case
[00:08:52] studies that we could use to then
[00:08:54] evangelize not only to net new customers
[00:08:56] but to sales reps who wanted to know
[00:08:58] that they were joining a company that
[00:09:00] was drisk from a selling perspective uh
[00:09:02] and so we started hiring and growing the
[00:09:03] team when hiring I think it's really
[00:09:05] important to look for urgency agency and
[00:09:09] customer Obsession the urgency in the
[00:09:11] agency are because you need people who
[00:09:13] can take a high level objective and
[00:09:15] relentlessly get after it and drive
[00:09:17] results double quick the customer
[00:09:19] obsession is because you also need to
[00:09:21] pair that with a level of self-awareness
[00:09:23] or Focus that lets you see when you're
[00:09:26] going down a rabbit hole and getting
[00:09:28] sucked into something that isn't
[00:09:29] actually going to be valuable to the
[00:09:30] user asking people about speed of
[00:09:33] execution is important you want people
[00:09:35] where when there's a problem they act
[00:09:37] fast and I think to a degree that can be
[00:09:39] learned for some people it's innate
[00:09:42] looking for times that people saw a
[00:09:44] problem on their own or were very close
[00:09:46] to the customer and actually took a
[00:09:48] problem into their own hands deviced a
[00:09:50] solution implemented it and got it out
[00:09:52] the door is important and that is
[00:09:54] inherently a high agency Endeavor a good
[00:09:57] reason to start a company is if you fall
[00:09:58] in love with the problem or the people
[00:10:00] who have that problem I think a big
[00:10:02] failure mode is getting attached to a
[00:10:04] specific solution too early a lot of
[00:10:06] companies want to build something but
[00:10:08] they don't want to solve something and
[00:10:10] if you build something and it doesn't
[00:10:12] actually solve a problem then your whole
[00:10:14] identity can crumble rather rapidly so I
[00:10:17] think it's important to Define your
[00:10:19] identity by a problem and not by a
[00:10:20] solution especially when you're in the
[00:10:22] pre-ra hunting for the solution
[00:10:24] especially the scalable solution days
[00:10:26] that you can bring to Market I do think
[00:10:28] startups are a potent Force for good it
[00:10:30] is perpetually astounding how much can
[00:10:33] come from the work of a small focused
[00:10:35] motivated group of people and as a
[00:10:37] Founder I think it's your job to create
[00:10:39] an environment where people know what
[00:10:41] their Charter is and then to drive
[00:10:43] Relentless tempo of execution so that
[00:10:45] you can capitalize on the
[00:10:49] vision as a startup you have to make so
[00:10:52] many decisions you have to pick the
[00:10:54] right database pick the right Tex stack
[00:10:56] build your software in a certain
[00:10:58] architecture
[00:10:59] and the sheer number of choices presents
[00:11:02] a lot of surface area to get things
[00:11:04] wrong but it's important to pick boring
[00:11:06] technology because as a startup you have
[00:11:09] so few resources and you really can't
[00:11:11] afford to spend spare calories trying to
[00:11:14] pursue unknown return on investment so
[00:11:17] experimenting with powerful new
[00:11:19] databases in my opinion is a luxury for
[00:11:22] people who have more time and money to
[00:11:23] burn it's important to pick
[00:11:25] wellestablished databases keep it very
[00:11:27] simple so that you can spend your
[00:11:30] calories on the innovations that are
[00:11:31] actually meaningful at gravity for
[00:11:33] instance we have a very boring Tech
[00:11:35] stack it's allowed a very small team of
[00:11:38] Engineers to scale to somewhat comical
[00:11:41] amount of data and to drive significant
[00:11:43] Revenue it does allow us to ship code
[00:11:45] dozens of times per day and if problems
[00:11:47] come up we can fix them in minutes not
[00:11:49] hours and if we want to build features
[00:11:51] we can do it in a really predictable way
[00:11:53] because we're never Fighting Tools we're
[00:11:55] never breaking out of a prison of our
[00:11:57] own creation which does sometimes happen
[00:11:59] I think of engineer as a skill set but I
[00:12:01] think that engineering as a sense of
[00:12:03] identity can be limiting for individuals
[00:12:05] as a startup your job isn't to build
[00:12:07] software your job is to build a product
[00:12:09] and that product needs to be useful for
[00:12:11] people the job is to make decisions that
[00:12:14] allow you to maximize the rate of change
[00:12:16] of your product so that you can get the
[00:12:18] most revs so that you can have the
[00:12:20] highest shot of building something
[00:12:21] useful so I would encourage software
[00:12:23] Engineers to think of themselves as
[00:12:25] product people where the way that they
[00:12:27] build product is by using software and I
[00:12:29] think that's an important mindset shift
[00:12:31] because a product person falls in love
[00:12:34] with the problem and the person who has
[00:12:36] the problem in that sense almost every
[00:12:38] problem can be really interesting if you
[00:12:39] get in the weeds enough with it carbon
[00:12:41] accounting somebody would reasonably
[00:12:43] call it dry and a little bit boring but
[00:12:46] if you're really serious about solving
[00:12:48] the problem and if you're really serious
[00:12:49] about building software to solve the
[00:12:51] problem then of course you need to
[00:12:53] understand the problem and the way it's
[00:12:54] laid out the terminology the language
[00:12:57] the people who have it in order to begin
[00:12:59] to create Solutions I think like many
[00:13:01] other companies in the climate space our
[00:13:03] ultimate mission is accelerating
[00:13:05] decarbonization and the transition to a
[00:13:07] sustainable economy but our particular
[00:13:10] contribution is to do so by succeeding
[00:13:13] in making acting on climate extremely
[00:13:15] attractive to the most energy intensive
[00:13:17] organizations more attractive fiscally
[00:13:19] more attractive from a labor perspective
[00:13:21] and easier to comply with the growing
[00:13:23] needs from a regulatory perspective
