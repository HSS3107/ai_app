[00:00:20] [ Applause ]
[00:00:29] >> Hello. Hi, I'm really excited
[00:00:32] to be here to talk to you today
[00:00:33] about The Qualities of Great
[00:00:35] Design.
[00:00:36] My name is Lauren Strehlow, and
[00:00:38] I'm a design evangelist here at
[00:00:40] Apple.
[00:00:41] The evangelism team, our number
[00:00:42] one goal is to help developers
[00:00:44] just like you create great apps.
[00:00:47] And a big part of my job is
[00:00:50] actually to work with the design
[00:00:51] presenters who are putting on
[00:00:53] all of the awesome design
[00:00:54] session content that you see
[00:00:55] here at the conference.
[00:00:58] So when I started to work with
[00:01:01] potential presenters this year
[00:01:03] about their talks, this theme of
[00:01:05] quality kept coming up, but
[00:01:07] nobody was talking about it head
[00:01:09] on, so I decided to.
[00:01:13] But I went about it a little bit
[00:01:14] differently.
[00:01:15] I decided to talk to great
[00:01:17] designers from our developer
[00:01:18] community, such as the creative
[00:01:21] director at The Game Band.
[00:01:24] I also talked to the cofounders
[00:01:27] of the Layers Conference, which
[00:01:28] is actually happening right now
[00:01:30] across the street.
[00:01:32] And I talked to the VP of Design
[00:01:34] at Khan Academy.
[00:01:36] I also talked to some of my
[00:01:37] great colleagues here at Apple
[00:01:39] who work in a wide variety of
[00:01:41] design disciplines.
[00:01:43] They work in type design, sound
[00:01:46] design, motion, visual, and
[00:01:49] interaction design.
[00:01:51] These are all real people who I
[00:01:54] truly admire and respect, and I
[00:01:57] think they have created great
[00:01:58] apps and games that have
[00:02:00] tremendous caliber.
[00:02:02] So I conducted a series of
[00:02:03] interviews.
[00:02:04] I talked to 13 people, and I
[00:02:07] asked them a ton of questions to
[00:02:09] discover what quality means to
[00:02:11] them, what challenges they face,
[00:02:14] and what they do to strive for
[00:02:16] excellence in design.
[00:02:18] So before you think any of this
[00:02:20] is scripted, I actually didn't
[00:02:23] give anybody these questions in
[00:02:24] advance.
[00:02:25] So everything you're about to
[00:02:27] hear today is real reactions to
[00:02:29] these questions.
[00:02:31] I collected over 15 hours of
[00:02:34] interview footage, and I've
[00:02:35] distilled it down to the very
[00:02:37] essence of these responses.
[00:02:40] So the audio clips you're about
[00:02:41] to hear today represent what I
[00:02:44] discovered about quality in
[00:02:46] great design.
[00:02:47] So today, we're going to dig
[00:02:50] into interpretations of quality
[00:02:52] and how it influences our
[00:02:53] perceptions and design
[00:02:55] directions.
[00:02:56] We're also going to talk about
[00:02:58] its effect on people's lives.
[00:03:02] [laughs] Actually, this is
[00:03:03] really exciting because it
[00:03:03] turned out to be so much more
[00:03:05] than what I expected.
[00:03:07] We're also going to hear about
[00:03:09] aspirations from the designers
[00:03:11] that I interviewed, to hear what
[00:03:13] drives them, what goals they
[00:03:14] have when they're striving for
[00:03:15] quality, even if those goals
[00:03:17] seem unattainable.
[00:03:20] And finally, I want to share
[00:03:21] some techniques that were
[00:03:23] revealed while asking people
[00:03:25] about their experiences.
[00:03:27] And I hope that these techniques
[00:03:28] can help you approach the
[00:03:30] challenge of designing for a lot
[00:03:31] of people.
[00:03:33] So this session is all about the
[00:03:35] qualities of great design
[00:03:37] defined by designers.
[00:03:40] So let's kick things off, and
[00:03:43] get started, and hear a few
[00:03:45] answers to this one simple
[00:03:49] question: What is quality?
[00:03:53] >> Quality is nothing else than
[00:03:55] what we agree upon is good.
[00:04:01] >> If something is quality, it
[00:04:03] implies that there is nothing
[00:04:05] random about it.
[00:04:09] >> The number one thing is just
[00:04:10] that something with a lot of
[00:04:13] care and time went into it.
[00:04:18] >> It's one of those things that
[00:04:19] people can feel it when they
[00:04:20] feel it, and it's very hard for
[00:04:22] them to put their finger on it.
[00:04:25] >> All right.
[00:04:25] This one I can really relate to.
[00:04:27] I'm totally a feeler, and so
[00:04:29] this naturally led me to ask a
[00:04:31] follow-on question: What does
[00:04:34] quality feel like?
[00:04:37] >> Does it feel like somebody
[00:04:38] has thought of you already and
[00:04:39] all the things that you need are
[00:04:41] easy to get to and very
[00:04:42] understandable?
[00:04:42] >> I think that when I'm
[00:04:47] thinking about things that are
[00:04:47] quality or handling things that
[00:04:49] are quality, it's things that
[00:04:52] aren't painful to use in any
[00:04:54] way, which could be, like,
[00:04:55] mentally painful, physically
[00:04:57] painful, emotionally painful,
[00:05:00] things that don't make me feel
[00:05:01] uncomfortable, or dumb, or
[00:05:04] [laughs] or inconvenienced.
[00:05:06] >> If you just launch the app
[00:05:09] and you feel, as you use it, oh,
[00:05:11] well, this feels like
[00:05:12] state-of-the-art technology that
[00:05:14] I'm using.
[00:05:15] This feels like it's easier for
[00:05:16] me to get things done.
[00:05:18] I feel more productive.
[00:05:19] I feel like I'm able to achieve
[00:05:21] better results.
[00:05:22] >> All the concentration that
[00:05:25] you're building up goes to the
[00:05:27] task at hand, the thing that you
[00:05:28] actually want to do.
[00:05:30] And that to me feels like
[00:05:31] quality.
[00:05:31] If you're able to achieve that,
[00:05:32] and people can be very creative,
[00:05:34] and make beautiful things, or
[00:05:36] have special moments through a
[00:05:38] device -- for example, by taking
[00:05:41] really good pictures, or sharing
[00:05:42] pictures with friends, or
[00:05:44] finding the right music to play
[00:05:45] at the right moment, or, you
[00:05:47] know, doing fun stuff with
[00:05:48] FaceTime, and seeing people on
[00:05:49] the other side of the world that
[00:05:50] you haven't seen in a long time
[00:05:52] -- all of that is very special.
[00:05:53] And again, none of that is
[00:05:55] around the UI that you're doing.
[00:05:56] None of that is about what
[00:05:58] interaction you chose to do that
[00:05:59] stuff.
[00:06:00] That should all be obvious, and
[00:06:01] blatantly unspoken, and just
[00:06:03] completely in the background.
[00:06:08] >> Wow. I just love that, that
[00:06:11] quality isn't about the UI or
[00:06:13] interactions, that it's about
[00:06:15] the moment, the people.
[00:06:17] You know, these are the people
[00:06:18] that you're designing for, and
[00:06:20] you're helping them create
[00:06:21] memories and share those moments
[00:06:23] with others.
[00:06:25] That is what this is all about.
[00:06:27] So how do you design for that?
[00:06:30] Well, I actually asked that
[00:06:32] question.
[00:06:34] >> It's hard.
[00:06:36] >> [laughter] Yeah.
[00:06:38] I hope you weren't actually
[00:06:39] hoping for a real answer here.
[00:06:40] It's definitely very hard, and
[00:06:42] we have 55 minutes to dig into
[00:06:44] why.
[00:06:45] So we just heard a ton of
[00:06:48] answers to this question, what
[00:06:50] is quality?
[00:06:52] We heard that it is what we
[00:06:54] agree upon is good, that it's
[00:06:58] not random, it's something that
[00:07:01] shows a lot of care and time
[00:07:04] went into it, and it feels like
[00:07:07] somebody has thought of you
[00:07:08] already.
[00:07:10] It can also be not painful in
[00:07:13] any way, and it feels state of
[00:07:16] the art.
[00:07:17] Quality things make it easier to
[00:07:19] get things done.
[00:07:21] And finally, your concentration
[00:07:23] goes to the thing that you
[00:07:24] really want to do, like sharing
[00:07:27] that picture or playing your
[00:07:28] favorite song.
[00:07:29] So by asking about quality, it
[00:07:33] resulted in many different
[00:07:34] answers, but what's so great
[00:07:37] about that is that it reflects
[00:07:39] what each one of these people
[00:07:40] truly care about.
[00:07:42] And of course, people care about
[00:07:44] different things, so it makes
[00:07:46] complete sense that they all
[00:07:47] have different interpretations
[00:07:49] of what quality is when it
[00:07:51] applies to apps and games.
[00:07:54] So we have a lot to get to
[00:07:56] today, but I really want to dig
[00:07:58] into just a couple of these
[00:08:00] responses.
[00:08:01] I think they're all great, but
[00:08:02] let's just dig into this first
[00:08:04] one here.
[00:08:06] And we're going to listen to the
[00:08:07] clip one more time.
[00:08:09] >> If something is quality, it
[00:08:12] implies that there is nothing
[00:08:14] random about it.
[00:08:15] >> During this interview with
[00:08:17] Nicole, she explained that not
[00:08:19] random to her meant not slapped
[00:08:22] together.
[00:08:23] And she used this word
[00:08:25] "considered."
[00:08:26] Great designs are considered.
[00:08:28] They're organized, and they show
[00:08:30] a thought process has taken
[00:08:31] place.
[00:08:32] And what I found really
[00:08:33] interesting is that she said
[00:08:35] that that's really visible to
[00:08:36] people, that that visibility of
[00:08:39] quality in design actually came
[00:08:40] up in another interview when I
[00:08:42] was talking with Mike.
[00:08:44] >> I guess this is probably a
[00:08:46] little clichÃ© sounding, but
[00:08:48] it's often the little things
[00:08:49] that are the telltale signs
[00:08:51] about craftsmanship.
[00:08:52] >> Okay, we have to pause right
[00:08:54] there because we're about to
[00:08:55] talk about craft in a design
[00:08:57] session, and Mike already called
[00:08:59] it out that it's a little
[00:09:00] clichÃ©, but before we listen to
[00:09:03] the rest of this clip, I need
[00:09:05] you to imagine that you're in
[00:09:07] the audio booth with us.
[00:09:09] There's not going to be anything
[00:09:10] on screen, so I want you to
[00:09:12] really focus on the words that
[00:09:14] Mike is about to say.
[00:09:16] Okay, here we go.
[00:09:19] >> We're sitting in this room
[00:09:21] here, and there's these panels
[00:09:22] on the wall, and the panels have
[00:09:24] a little bit of a gap between
[00:09:26] them.
[00:09:26] And we can look at the width of
[00:09:28] the gap as you look from the top
[00:09:31] of the wall to the bottom of the
[00:09:33] wall.
[00:09:33] And if there's variable
[00:09:36] separation or variable width of
[00:09:37] that gap, you just get the sense
[00:09:39] that it wasn't well crafted.
[00:09:43] >> Right. So really, while Mike
[00:09:46] was talking about those variable
[00:09:48] widths in the gaps of the panels
[00:09:50] in the audio booth, you know, I
[00:09:52] understood that he's saying that
[00:09:54] those details are visible, and
[00:09:56] they matter a lot.
[00:09:59] And it's through consideration
[00:10:00] and being really deliberate, and
[00:10:02] thinking through every single
[00:10:04] detail thoughtfully, well, that
[00:10:06] shows.
[00:10:06] And so being really into your
[00:10:09] craft here is the point because
[00:10:11] the best things that we love are
[00:10:13] not random.
[00:10:14] They're not slapped together.
[00:10:16] They're intentional through
[00:10:17] every detail.
[00:10:19] And if you can do that, that's
[00:10:21] quality.
[00:10:23] So let's explore one more answer
[00:10:25] to the question, what is
[00:10:26] quality, and listen to the clip
[00:10:28] again.
[00:10:30] >> The number one thing is just
[00:10:31] that something with a lot of
[00:10:34] care and time went into it.
[00:10:38] >> This one in particular really
[00:10:39] resonated with me because when
[00:10:42] you're writing questions to
[00:10:43] interviews like, what is
[00:10:44] quality, you naturally end up
[00:10:46] asking yourself, and to me,
[00:10:49] quality is all about care.
[00:10:52] So when I heard care connected
[00:10:53] to quality not only from that
[00:10:55] clip we just heard from Travis,
[00:10:57] but it also came up in my
[00:10:59] interview with Gary.
[00:11:01] >> If it's quality, it's better
[00:11:03] than something that's not
[00:11:04] quality by virtue of someone
[00:11:06] caring about it.
[00:11:07] >> Right. I totally agree that
[00:11:10] caring makes things better.
[00:11:12] For example, I care about this
[00:11:14] presentation, so, naturally,
[00:11:16] it's just a little bit better
[00:11:18] than if I didn't care about it
[00:11:19] at all.
[00:11:20] So now, I feel like we should
[00:11:22] dig into, what is care?
[00:11:26] Okay, we're going to stick with
[00:11:27] a few interview clips from Gary
[00:11:28] so you can hear more of the full
[00:11:30] conversation.
[00:11:32] So I asked him, "How would you
[00:11:34] describe care?"
[00:11:36] >> Just that someone, excuse my
[00:11:40] French, gave a [beep].
[00:11:44] >> [laughter] I'm not sure if
[00:11:44] that's a WWDC first, but it's
[00:11:46] simple.
[00:11:47] I like it.
[00:11:48] [laughs] Really, what he's
[00:11:49] saying here is that care is a
[00:11:52] motivator.
[00:11:53] So how do you look at care in
[00:11:56] design?
[00:11:57] >> I look at it from 2 lenses of
[00:12:00] care.
[00:12:00] Did I care enough to make it the
[00:12:02] best it could be?
[00:12:02] But do I also care about what
[00:12:04] your experience is?
[00:12:06] Be it you.
[00:12:07] Be it my mum.
[00:12:08] Be it my next-door neighbor.
[00:12:09] Be it anybody around the world.
[00:12:11] You have to kind of, sort of
[00:12:12] take yourself out of the
[00:12:13] equation, put yourself in their
[00:12:15] shoes so you can be sure that
[00:12:17] their experience is a quality
[00:12:18] experience.
[00:12:19] So you have to care enough to do
[00:12:20] that.
[00:12:21] It's not just about caring about
[00:12:22] your own sense of, "Oh, I like
[00:12:25] my design, and I cared enough to
[00:12:27] make it good for me."
[00:12:28] It's about it being good for as
[00:12:30] many people as possible or for
[00:12:33] the target audience, if it
[00:12:34] happens to be a more narrowly
[00:12:35] focused thing.
[00:12:38] >> Right. So when I heard this,
[00:12:40] I was just, I wanted to know
[00:12:41] how, immediately.
[00:12:43] How do you design that
[00:12:45] experience for others, and how
[00:12:47] do you know when you've made
[00:12:48] progress?
[00:12:49] >> I think sometimes we look at
[00:12:51] a tangled mess of problems that
[00:12:53] we need to solve, and if, at the
[00:12:55] end, you can look at the result
[00:12:57] and go, that is so much better,
[00:12:58] and if it came easy, it wouldn't
[00:13:01] be as fun, but the fact that you
[00:13:02] sweated over it, that you really
[00:13:05] worked hard at it, that it gave
[00:13:06] you sleepless nights, that you
[00:13:08] poured late nights and weekends
[00:13:10] into solving those problems,
[00:13:12] combined effort, team effort,
[00:13:14] the end result is so much more
[00:13:16] satisfying.
[00:13:18] I love it when we work hard and
[00:13:20] get there more than when ideas
[00:13:22] just come easily.
[00:13:24] I worry that we've actually
[00:13:25] missed something by not working
[00:13:27] hard.
[00:13:27] If it's too easy, we've become
[00:13:29] complacent, and I don't think
[00:13:31] you get anywhere rewarding
[00:13:32] without doing hard work.
[00:13:36] >> I really understood this
[00:13:37] point about working hard after
[00:13:40] Gary related this to mountain
[00:13:42] biking.
[00:13:44] We talked about this for a
[00:13:45] while, so I'm just going to
[00:13:46] summarize that conversation here
[00:13:48] for you today.
[00:13:49] Essentially, you have to work
[00:13:51] really hard to get to the top of
[00:13:53] the mountain, and then you can
[00:13:55] have a ton of fun on the
[00:13:56] descent.
[00:13:57] Now, it's not as much fun if you
[00:13:59] just started at the top and went
[00:14:01] down because it's really all of
[00:14:04] that time, and effort, and sweat
[00:14:07] that brings you to the top of
[00:14:08] the mountain that makes the view
[00:14:10] all that more beautiful and
[00:14:12] makes the ride down so much more
[00:14:16] fun.
[00:14:16] So in life, care naturally gives
[00:14:21] more time and effort because you
[00:14:24] have a passion to achieve your
[00:14:25] goals, and you'll do whatever is
[00:14:27] needed to meet your own
[00:14:29] expectations.
[00:14:30] And yeah, that's totally a lot
[00:14:32] of work, but that hard work has
[00:14:35] a payoff, and it's really
[00:14:37] satisfying.
[00:14:38] And the payoff, well, that's why
[00:14:40] you did it in the first place,
[00:14:41] right?
[00:14:42] You have a goal, and you make it
[00:14:45] happen.
[00:14:45] That's just awesome.
[00:14:47] So quality is all about care,
[00:14:51] and because you care, you're
[00:14:53] going to put in that time and
[00:14:55] effort to make things great.
[00:14:57] And that's just one answer to
[00:15:00] the question, what is quality?
[00:15:03] And because there are so many
[00:15:05] different interpretations of
[00:15:06] quality, well, that means it's
[00:15:09] just really hard to achieve.
[00:15:12] A little bit later, we're going
[00:15:13] to get into some techniques to
[00:15:15] hopefully help make the process
[00:15:16] of designing a little bit
[00:15:17] easier.
[00:15:18] But for now, let's just recap
[00:15:20] what we've learned.
[00:15:21] So far, just by asking a few
[00:15:25] simple questions, we've learned
[00:15:27] that quality means something
[00:15:29] different to different people,
[00:15:32] that it's not random -- it is
[00:15:34] crafted and considered.
[00:15:37] Quality is the result of time,
[00:15:40] effort, and care.
[00:15:41] And it is just hard to achieve,
[00:15:46] but that's okay.
[00:15:49] Quality has many different
[00:15:50] interpretations.
[00:15:52] What is yours?
[00:15:53] I think this is really important
[00:15:56] to ask yourself, what is
[00:15:58] quality, and what does it mean
[00:15:59] to you, and what does it mean to
[00:16:01] your app or game, because that's
[00:16:03] going to reveal what you truly
[00:16:05] care about, and that's going to
[00:16:06] help you focus on what you're
[00:16:08] working towards going forward.
[00:16:10] So let's just pause here for a
[00:16:13] moment, and we actually need to
[00:16:15] go back a bit.
[00:16:16] Why does quality matter in the
[00:16:17] first place?
[00:16:18] Why are we even talking about it
[00:16:20] here at WWDC?
[00:16:21] Well, what's the significance?
[00:16:25] Let's just ask, why is quality
[00:16:28] important?
[00:16:30] >> Quality impacts the world
[00:16:34] that we interact with in so many
[00:16:36] different ways all the time
[00:16:37] throughout our day.
[00:16:39] >> Yeah. Travis is totally
[00:16:41] right.
[00:16:42] Throughout our day, there are
[00:16:43] things that we eat, drink, wear,
[00:16:47] I mean, even the air we breathe.
[00:16:49] They all have some level of
[00:16:50] quality that impacts us.
[00:16:53] And we expect quality in our
[00:16:55] friendships, in our family, in
[00:16:57] our relationships.
[00:16:59] We seek out people who show us
[00:17:01] respect, who care about us and
[00:17:03] make us feel good.
[00:17:03] I mean, nobody keeps around
[00:17:06] poor-quality friends.
[00:17:08] We also expect quality from the
[00:17:09] products that we use and the
[00:17:11] things that we use every day.
[00:17:13] We expect them not to break.
[00:17:16] And if they do break, well, we
[00:17:18] tend to think that they're cheap
[00:17:19] and not well made, and we
[00:17:22] typically won't buy them again.
[00:17:25] So yeah, the concept of quality
[00:17:28] impacts our every day, and it's
[00:17:30] really in everything.
[00:17:33] While it's really wide reaching
[00:17:34] and broad, there seems to be
[00:17:36] something so special about
[00:17:39] quality, but what is it?
[00:17:41] What makes quality special?
[00:17:44] >> They say, like, oh, I cooked
[00:17:46] this with love, and it can just
[00:17:47] be eggs or whatever, but it does
[00:17:50] taste different, and I think
[00:17:52] Jessie and I like to think that
[00:17:54] whatever we do, that sort of
[00:17:56] love for what we're doing comes
[00:17:57] through.
[00:17:59] >> Right? I know these two
[00:18:01] ladies absolutely love what they
[00:18:02] do, and I know I can feel it
[00:18:05] when someone really loves
[00:18:07] something.
[00:18:08] And to Elaine's first point, you
[00:18:10] know, I think everyone here
[00:18:11] knows that Mom and Dad's food
[00:18:13] just tastes a little bit better
[00:18:15] because it's made with that care
[00:18:17] and love.
[00:18:19] So what really Elaine means by
[00:18:21] this is your intentions are
[00:18:24] felt.
[00:18:25] So if your intention is to
[00:18:27] create something great and you
[00:18:29] do everything you need to do to
[00:18:31] achieve that, people are going
[00:18:32] to know.
[00:18:33] They're going to feel it.
[00:18:35] And the reverse is true too.
[00:18:37] You know, if you rushed and you
[00:18:38] didn't really care about the
[00:18:40] look of settings in your app UI,
[00:18:42] well, it's going to impact the
[00:18:44] overall feeling that people have
[00:18:47] about your app.
[00:18:50] So throughout the course of
[00:18:52] conducting these interviews, I
[00:18:53] started to see the word
[00:18:55] "quality" everywhere, like
[00:18:57] quality coffee or quality meats.
[00:19:01] And even one night when I was
[00:19:02] working really late, and I
[00:19:03] ordered a pizza, and the pizza
[00:19:05] box said, "Our commitment is
[00:19:07] quality."
[00:19:09] [laughs] So I see the word
[00:19:11] everywhere now.
[00:19:12] It's really pervasive, from
[00:19:14] signs to badges, to labels.
[00:19:17] So I brought this up in a few of
[00:19:19] the interviews, not because I
[00:19:21] wanted to know what people
[00:19:22] thought of labeling, but,
[00:19:23] instead, to ask, why do we tend
[00:19:26] to be drawn towards things that
[00:19:28] are quality?
[00:19:31] >> Well, survival instinct at
[00:19:34] its root.
[00:19:35] On a more deep level, I guess,
[00:19:36] why do we desire quality?
[00:19:38] We desire quality because we
[00:19:39] want to live.
[00:19:41] And a good survival strategy for
[00:19:44] living is to put things into our
[00:19:47] body, to eat things, or to wear
[00:19:50] things, or to drive in things,
[00:19:52] or to live in things that are
[00:19:54] safe and have been well
[00:19:56] constructed so they aren't going
[00:19:59] to cause us bodily harm.
[00:20:01] And so I think purely on a
[00:20:04] survival level, quality is a
[00:20:07] very important concept for us.
[00:20:08] It's a very important attribute
[00:20:10] that we seek in everything.
[00:20:14] >> Mike explained a bit further
[00:20:16] during this interview.
[00:20:17] We were talking about this
[00:20:19] fictitious butcher shop, and if
[00:20:22] we were in this shop, quality
[00:20:24] would be communicated not only
[00:20:25] by the products itself, but also
[00:20:28] the shop being really clean and
[00:20:30] interacting with the really nice
[00:20:32] people that work there.
[00:20:34] Every facet of the entire
[00:20:36] experience would meet your
[00:20:38] expectations, [laughs] and it
[00:20:40] would also be connected to that
[00:20:42] proposition of quality.
[00:20:44] And that evokes trust.
[00:20:49] Trust comes from products
[00:20:51] upholding their promise, and
[00:20:53] that quality experience is far
[00:20:56] more important than any label
[00:20:58] because I am definitely not
[00:21:00] suggesting that you add a label
[00:21:02] to your apps because you
[00:21:04] [laughs] definitely don't need
[00:21:06] to.
[00:21:07] Every facet of your app
[00:21:10] experience, from the screenshots
[00:21:12] on the App Store to the
[00:21:14] description, to how you respond
[00:21:16] to customer reviews, all through
[00:21:19] to your app's interface, these
[00:21:21] experiences, these interactions
[00:21:23] that you have with people, that
[00:21:25] communicates the quality about
[00:21:27] your app or your game.
[00:21:29] And you don't want a label
[00:21:31] anyway.
[00:21:32] Why?
[00:21:35] >> In a way, it's like saying
[00:21:37] you're cool.
[00:21:38] Like, being cool doesn't involve
[00:21:41] saying you're cool.
[00:21:43] [laughs] And, you know, you only
[00:21:46] say that someone else is cool.
[00:21:48] It's only something which can be
[00:21:49] sort of determined by an outside
[00:21:51] party, in a way.
[00:21:53] And even then, there's a certain
[00:21:56] context where it feels more
[00:21:57] appropriate than others.
[00:21:58] Like, if we're talking about
[00:21:59] Thelonious Monk and we're just
[00:22:01] talking about jazz in the '50's,
[00:22:03] like, that's cool.
[00:22:05] That's the birth of cool, right.
[00:22:06] [laughs] That's where it's,
[00:22:08] like, totally appropriate to use
[00:22:10] that kind of term, but that's an
[00:22:13] earned coolness.
[00:22:15] And so quality has to be earned.
[00:22:17] >> I think Mike makes a really
[00:22:19] good point.
[00:22:20] So the significance of quality
[00:22:24] is massive.
[00:22:25] As we heard, it impacts our
[00:22:27] every day, it can be felt, and
[00:22:30] it evokes trust in the people
[00:22:32] that are using your app.
[00:22:35] All right.
[00:22:37] Now, everyone I talked to
[00:22:39] throughout these interviews,
[00:22:40] they all have a passion for
[00:22:42] excellence, so we're going to
[00:22:43] talk about four design
[00:22:45] aspirations, and these four
[00:22:47] aspirations really stood out to
[00:22:49] me because, well, they seemed
[00:22:51] just so incredibly elusive and
[00:22:53] hard to achieve.
[00:22:54] But these designers use them as
[00:22:57] motivation to strive for quality
[00:23:00] in their work, and these
[00:23:01] aspirations are to design things
[00:23:04] that are simple, stunning,
[00:23:09] timeless, and leave a positive
[00:23:12] impact on people's lives.
[00:23:14] So we're going to dig into each
[00:23:16] one of these to discover why
[00:23:18] they're important and also how
[00:23:20] they provide motivation to
[00:23:22] create great design.
[00:23:24] All right.
[00:23:25] Let's start with simplicity.
[00:23:27] This came up in response to this
[00:23:30] question: What makes a great
[00:23:33] app?
[00:23:35] >> It's simple.
[00:23:36] It doesn't try to do more than
[00:23:38] it needs to do.
[00:23:39] And what it does, it does it
[00:23:41] really well.
[00:23:41] >> I don't know about you, but I
[00:23:44] have heard that a lot.
[00:23:46] [laughs] So I'm sure you've
[00:23:47] heard it before too.
[00:23:49] But there's got to be a reason
[00:23:51] why that phrase is on repeat,
[00:23:53] and I was really thinking about
[00:23:56] this after the interview.
[00:23:57] You know, why should apps be
[00:23:59] simple, and why is that a good
[00:24:01] thing?
[00:24:02] Well, it finally clicked for me
[00:24:03] one day after work.
[00:24:06] I got home, I needed to cook
[00:24:08] some dinner, and I needed an app
[00:24:10] to help me with a recipe, to not
[00:24:11] make cooking any harder than it
[00:24:13] already is.
[00:24:14] And as soon as I was home, I
[00:24:16] remembered that I needed to go
[00:24:18] ahead and put, book pet care for
[00:24:20] my two dogs because I'm going on
[00:24:21] vacation after WWDC.
[00:24:22] Aw, aren't they cute?
[00:24:24] [laughs] Okay, we have to stop
[00:24:28] before I get distracted.
[00:24:29] We're talking about two tasks
[00:24:31] here, cooking dinner and pet
[00:24:34] care.
[00:24:35] Why do the apps that help me
[00:24:36] with those, why do they need to
[00:24:38] be simple?
[00:24:38] Well, it's because I don't go
[00:24:41] into them all the time, so they
[00:24:43] need to be instantly
[00:24:44] understandable, as if I already
[00:24:46] know how to use them.
[00:24:47] So familiar navigation and
[00:24:49] gestures really help with that.
[00:24:51] You know, the goal is launch the
[00:24:53] app, I totally get it, and I can
[00:24:55] get the task done.
[00:24:57] But why else should they be
[00:24:58] simple?
[00:25:00] Well, it could be a good day or
[00:25:02] a bad day, but I'm using these
[00:25:04] apps in real life, and that's
[00:25:07] where all of my mental energy
[00:25:08] should be, not wasted on a
[00:25:10] confusing app UI, interaction,
[00:25:13] or interface.
[00:25:14] Apps should not be a burden, and
[00:25:17] it's a lot easier to get back to
[00:25:18] real life when they're simple.
[00:25:21] So how would you describe
[00:25:23] simplicity in apps and games?
[00:25:25] >> It just has to work.
[00:25:28] >> Right. It just has to work
[00:25:31] for the people that are using
[00:25:32] it.
[00:25:32] But there's actually something
[00:25:34] else here.
[00:25:35] You don't want people to feel
[00:25:36] distracted.
[00:25:38] Simple, easy-to-understand apps
[00:25:41] that just work, well, they help
[00:25:43] keep people focused.
[00:25:45] I know for me, I can get really
[00:25:46] easily overwhelmed if
[00:25:47] something's out of place.
[00:25:49] It can just take me out of that
[00:25:50] experience, and that makes
[00:25:52] getting the task done even
[00:25:53] harder.
[00:25:54] I was actually talking to Jessie
[00:25:56] about this, and I asked her,
[00:25:59] what does she look for in great
[00:26:01] apps?
[00:26:01] >> Make my life feel a little
[00:26:04] bit easier or make my life feel
[00:26:06] a little bit nicer or more
[00:26:08] luxurious.
[00:26:09] >> I think that is just spot on.
[00:26:12] Make my life feel a little bit
[00:26:13] easier by being simple, focused,
[00:26:18] instantly understandable, and
[00:26:20] just do one thing really, really
[00:26:22] well.
[00:26:23] That is the goal.
[00:26:25] All right, this next aspiration
[00:26:29] is to be stunning, and this came
[00:26:31] up when I was talking to
[00:26:32] Caroline.
[00:26:33] I asked her, "What communicates
[00:26:36] great visual design?"
[00:26:39] >> Just that polish.
[00:26:42] Does it look great?
[00:26:43] Does it look stunning?
[00:26:45] And then, the other level of
[00:26:46] polish, on a different kind of
[00:26:48] app, like a game or something,
[00:26:50] to me is making it feel
[00:26:52] beautiful as an experience, like
[00:26:54] it feels like a work of art.
[00:26:57] >> Right, yes.
[00:26:59] So we talked a little bit
[00:27:00] further about this, and Caroline
[00:27:02] explained that what she means by
[00:27:04] polish is things lining up just
[00:27:07] the way you intend them to be,
[00:27:09] including how it feels.
[00:27:10] You know, swipe animations
[00:27:12] lining right up with those swipe
[00:27:14] gestures.
[00:27:15] And the best apps appear
[00:27:17] visually perfect, and that is
[00:27:18] just totally remarkable.
[00:27:20] And she also mentioned games.
[00:27:23] Games should absolutely aspire
[00:27:25] to be stunning.
[00:27:27] Games are a perfect escape from
[00:27:29] this world into a different one.
[00:27:32] And they accomplish this through
[00:27:34] stunning, immersive visuals.
[00:27:37] I mean, I love TV and movies,
[00:27:39] but that's a really passive
[00:27:41] escape.
[00:27:42] In games, well, they're an
[00:27:43] active one, and that's why I
[00:27:45] love them.
[00:27:46] But there is one essential thing
[00:27:48] that all games must do.
[00:27:50] They must teach you, the player,
[00:27:53] the rules.
[00:27:53] And this is really a first
[00:27:56] impression that people have of a
[00:27:57] lot of games, so it makes me
[00:27:59] really sad when games make a bad
[00:28:02] first impression because when
[00:28:04] I'm trying to learn, well, the
[00:28:06] rules feel slapped together,
[00:28:09] added on last minute, or it just
[00:28:11] doesn't feel a part of the
[00:28:12] game's world.
[00:28:13] So I decided to ask Sam, who's
[00:28:16] working on an upcoming game
[00:28:18] called Where Cards Fall, "How do
[00:28:20] you learn the rules of the game
[00:28:22] all while staying in the game's
[00:28:24] world?"
[00:28:24] >> With games in particular,
[00:28:27] there's a real joy that can come
[00:28:29] from discovering what they can
[00:28:31] do and learning for yourself.
[00:28:33] People tend to remember things
[00:28:35] the best when they experience
[00:28:37] them themselves, when they learn
[00:28:38] them through some sort of active
[00:28:40] discovery.
[00:28:41] So if we give them too much at
[00:28:43] the beginning, we're robbing
[00:28:45] them of that chance to reward
[00:28:47] their own curiosity.
[00:28:48] So we always want to make sure
[00:28:49] that they stay curious, that
[00:28:51] they stay interested throughout
[00:28:52] the entire experience, and that
[00:28:55] they have a lot of different
[00:28:56] moments where they can be
[00:28:57] rewarded for trying something.
[00:28:58] And when they try something and
[00:29:00] they discover something for the
[00:29:01] first time, they definitely
[00:29:03] won't forget it.
[00:29:03] But if we throw up like a
[00:29:04] tooltip or some way of just
[00:29:06] making sure that we as the game
[00:29:08] designers are comfortable
[00:29:09] knowing that they know
[00:29:10] something, there's a pretty good
[00:29:12] chance that they'll forget it
[00:29:13] later on since they didn't go
[00:29:14] through the process of learning
[00:29:15] it themselves.
[00:29:19] So when I go into a game for the
[00:29:21] first time, I want to learn how
[00:29:24] to navigate the world, if it
[00:29:26] takes place in a world, as
[00:29:29] quickly as possible or just how
[00:29:30] to understand the rules of the
[00:29:31] game as quickly as possible, but
[00:29:34] not so quickly that I'm kind of
[00:29:35] robbed of my curiosity to
[00:29:37] explore them a little bit
[00:29:38] further.
[00:29:39] So I tend to get a sense for
[00:29:42] what the game is, and if the
[00:29:44] game continues to surprise me,
[00:29:46] I'll make it through to the
[00:29:48] finish line.
[00:29:51] >> Wow, that was learning the
[00:29:53] rules in Where Cards Fall, and
[00:29:55] that definitely feels a part of
[00:29:57] the game's world, and I think
[00:29:59] everyone can learn from what Sam
[00:30:01] said about active discovery.
[00:30:03] And this is not just for games.
[00:30:05] Active discovery is so much
[00:30:07] better than reading tooltips or
[00:30:09] chasing a pointing arrow, and to
[00:30:12] Sam's point, being told isn't as
[00:30:14] much fun or, frankly, effective
[00:30:17] as discovering something for
[00:30:19] yourself.
[00:30:20] It's kind of like being told
[00:30:22] about a vacation versus being on
[00:30:24] that vacation yourself.
[00:30:26] It's way more fun, and you're
[00:30:28] just going to remember it better
[00:30:29] if you actually go through that
[00:30:31] experience.
[00:30:33] So whether you're creating an
[00:30:35] app or a game, aspire to be
[00:30:38] stunning.
[00:30:39] Create beautiful experiences,
[00:30:41] polish your visual design so it
[00:30:43] looks and feels just a part of
[00:30:45] your app or game's world.
[00:30:47] Okay, timeless.
[00:30:51] This has been on my mind since
[00:30:54] talking with Hugo, a sound
[00:30:55] designer.
[00:30:56] Most of you will recognize this.
[00:31:00] [ Ringtone ]
[00:31:10] I'm always looking for where
[00:31:11] that phone is.
[00:31:13] But what reminded me of this
[00:31:14] ringtone was this part of the
[00:31:17] interview.
[00:31:18] >> If we create a ringtone for
[00:31:24] the new iPhone, then we don't
[00:31:27] want it to sound dated after a
[00:31:28] year, of course.
[00:31:29] It should still be a great
[00:31:32] ringtone after 5 years, and
[00:31:34] maybe people will still remember
[00:31:35] it after 10 years.
[00:31:37] >> It was actually this section
[00:31:41] of the quote that really made me
[00:31:43] think of timelessness.
[00:31:46] You know, it makes sense for a
[00:31:47] ringtone not to want to sound
[00:31:49] dated, but this could also apply
[00:31:51] to your visual and interaction
[00:31:53] design too.
[00:31:55] Hugo used this word "durability"
[00:31:57] to describe quality during our
[00:32:00] interview, and I think that's
[00:32:01] really great.
[00:32:03] If we all aspire to create
[00:32:04] designs that are just a little
[00:32:06] bit longer lasting, it not only
[00:32:08] would save us time and effort
[00:32:10] now, but it would put us into
[00:32:12] the right mindset to provide
[00:32:14] something that we create with
[00:32:15] the opportunity to be timeless.
[00:32:21] This final aspiration really had
[00:32:23] an impact on me, and it came
[00:32:25] from my colleague Doug when I
[00:32:27] asked him, "What makes great app
[00:32:29] experiences?"
[00:32:32] >> When I think of, like, great
[00:32:34] app experiences and things that
[00:32:36] kind of provide something unique
[00:32:38] and valuable to users, I think a
[00:32:40] lot of it is the substantial
[00:32:43] kind of positive effect that it
[00:32:45] has on the user's life.
[00:32:48] >> Doug, you nailed it.
[00:32:51] Yes, absolutely, apps should
[00:32:53] provide something unique and
[00:32:54] valuable, but, actually, it was
[00:32:57] this part, the positive effect,
[00:32:59] that really resonated with me.
[00:33:01] It made me reassess the apps and
[00:33:03] games on my phone.
[00:33:05] After this interview, I
[00:33:06] literally scrolled through all
[00:33:08] of my apps, and I thought, which
[00:33:10] ones have a positive effect on
[00:33:13] my life?
[00:33:14] You know, wouldn't it be great
[00:33:17] if life just had a little more
[00:33:19] positivity?
[00:33:21] So next time you design, strive
[00:33:24] for simplicity because real life
[00:33:26] if where we need to be spending
[00:33:28] our energy.
[00:33:29] Aspire to be stunning because we
[00:33:32] all need a break from chaos, and
[00:33:34] it's really nice to escape and
[00:33:36] experience something beautiful.
[00:33:38] Design to be timeless.
[00:33:41] Think about how your designs can
[00:33:43] be good now but also years from
[00:33:45] now because we could all design
[00:33:47] to be a little less trendy and
[00:33:49] definitely more durable.
[00:33:51] And finally, think about how you
[00:33:54] could have a positive impact on
[00:33:56] people's lives.
[00:33:58] And, you know, this can manifest
[00:33:59] itself in really different ways
[00:34:01] depending on your app.
[00:34:02] It could be maybe that
[00:34:04] positivity is being really
[00:34:05] accurate, or maybe it's just
[00:34:07] being super entertaining.
[00:34:09] Maybe it's just making someone's
[00:34:10] life or day feel a little bit
[00:34:13] easier.
[00:34:13] I hope that you found some of
[00:34:16] these thoughts to be as
[00:34:17] inspiring as I did.
[00:34:20] I'm sure you're thinking now,
[00:34:21] though, well, sure, this has
[00:34:22] been mildly inspiring and
[00:34:24] somewhat educational, but what
[00:34:26] can I do?
[00:34:27] What can I actually take away
[00:34:29] and apply to my work?
[00:34:30] Well, I wanted to know that too.
[00:34:33] After talking with so many
[00:34:35] different people from different
[00:34:36] backgrounds, I wanted to know
[00:34:38] what they learned -- what they
[00:34:40] learned on the job through their
[00:34:42] experiences.
[00:34:43] So through a series of
[00:34:44] questions, I uncovered a few
[00:34:46] tips and techniques that these
[00:34:48] designers use regularly when
[00:34:50] designing.
[00:34:52] And something important to
[00:34:53] mention about design before we
[00:34:54] get started is, yes, design is
[00:34:58] hard because nobody sets out to
[00:35:01] create a bad app.
[00:35:02] Making great designs is what we
[00:35:04] all strive for, but let's be
[00:35:07] honest.
[00:35:08] We don't always achieve it, and
[00:35:11] that's okay because we keep
[00:35:12] trying and we learn a lot along
[00:35:15] the way.
[00:35:16] Okay, let's go ahead and hear
[00:35:19] this first technique, and it
[00:35:21] really surprised me.
[00:35:22] It came up when I was talking
[00:35:24] with Loic [phonetic], a type
[00:35:25] designer, and I asked him, "What
[00:35:27] helps you with your work?"
[00:35:30] >> So in the case of type
[00:35:32] design, for instance, we've
[00:35:33] developed all kinds of little
[00:35:35] drawing tricks.
[00:35:36] In type design especially,
[00:35:38] subjectiveness I feel can
[00:35:41] [inaudible] even more than in
[00:35:42] other aspects of design because
[00:35:44] we go to the depth of how the
[00:35:46] particular curve of, on the
[00:35:48] shoulder of a lowercase m is,
[00:35:50] for instance.
[00:35:50] And we can have a 10-minute
[00:35:52] discussion only on that.
[00:35:55] But the difficult part is
[00:35:56] describing what you see in words
[00:35:59] that the other person is going
[00:36:01] to understand the way you mean
[00:36:03] it, and that's very difficult
[00:36:05] when you're talking about shape.
[00:36:06] But one way we started doing
[00:36:08] that with some of my colleagues
[00:36:10] was basically redrawing the
[00:36:12] shape we're looking at with
[00:36:14] exaggerated features, where we
[00:36:16] basically kind of make a
[00:36:18] caricature of what we are
[00:36:19] seeing.
[00:36:20] So if I'm pushing what I'm
[00:36:22] seeing to the extreme of why I
[00:36:25] find it ugly or uncomfortable,
[00:36:28] it's because it feels like that
[00:36:30] to me.
[00:36:31] And through that drawing,
[00:36:32] usually the other people can
[00:36:33] start seeing that much more
[00:36:36] toned down but existing feature
[00:36:38] of the design that they weren't
[00:36:40] necessarily perceiving before
[00:36:41] because that's not what they
[00:36:42] were looking at.
[00:36:44] So it is about trying to make
[00:36:46] people see the world through
[00:36:48] your eyes and the other way
[00:36:50] around, like gaining the ability
[00:36:52] to see the world through their
[00:36:53] eyes, so that you can then find
[00:36:55] that third place that is
[00:36:56] actually the joint gaze that you
[00:37:00] have on the world.
[00:37:02] And that's the, that I think to
[00:37:04] me is the key of a successful
[00:37:07] collaboration in design is
[00:37:08] finding that place.
[00:37:13] >> Wow. Before we even dig into
[00:37:15] this technique, have you thought
[00:37:17] about type design?
[00:37:19] I mean, every single letter that
[00:37:20] you text, and email, and that
[00:37:22] you read, that's been designed,
[00:37:25] and type designers care so much
[00:37:27] about detail that they've
[00:37:29] invented ways to communicate
[00:37:31] about shape when there are no
[00:37:33] words.
[00:37:34] That's just so cool.
[00:37:36] So to Loic's point, when you're
[00:37:38] designing for others, it's
[00:37:40] really necessary to see the
[00:37:42] world through their eyes, and
[00:37:44] this technique helps achieve
[00:37:46] that.
[00:37:46] So draw caricatures and ask
[00:37:50] others to do the same.
[00:37:52] It's really the importance of
[00:37:53] putting yourself in others'
[00:37:54] shoes because you can better
[00:37:56] understand their world.
[00:37:58] And this is a great tool for
[00:37:59] communication if words are not
[00:38:01] doing it, and it'll help you
[00:38:03] understand what others are
[00:38:04] seeing.
[00:38:05] This next technique is going to
[00:38:08] be unveiled through a story.
[00:38:10] Actually, even better, a first
[00:38:13] job story.
[00:38:15] Because you learn a lot on your
[00:38:17] first job, and they have a huge
[00:38:19] impact.
[00:38:20] So I asked my colleague Doug
[00:38:22] what he learned at his first
[00:38:24] design job.
[00:38:25] >> One of the real kind of ahas
[00:38:30] for me was a question that I got
[00:38:33] at the Tech Museum from the Head
[00:38:35] of Design that was essentially,
[00:38:37] why is this good?
[00:38:39] Why is this thing that you just
[00:38:41] gave me good?
[00:38:42] And, you know, my initial
[00:38:45] reaction was, well, because I
[00:38:47] think this will be easy for
[00:38:49] people to do.
[00:38:50] And, you know, he responded,
[00:38:53] like, well, how do you know
[00:38:54] that?
[00:38:54] How do you know that this is
[00:38:55] going to be easier than the way
[00:38:57] that we do it now?
[00:38:58] And I kind of realized that I
[00:39:01] didn't know the answer to that.
[00:39:03] And then, I realized what he was
[00:39:05] really asking is, should we put
[00:39:07] all of this energy into making
[00:39:10] the changes that you're
[00:39:11] suggesting?
[00:39:13] How can we be sure that that's
[00:39:14] the right thing to do?
[00:39:15] And to answer that question, I
[00:39:19] opened up -- it might have been
[00:39:21] Microsoft Paint [laughs] -- and
[00:39:23] I drew a picture, and I took it
[00:39:27] out onto the museum floor, and
[00:39:29] basically asked visitors to give
[00:39:32] me their impression of what they
[00:39:35] thought they should do based on
[00:39:37] kind of how I had arranged
[00:39:39] things on the screen.
[00:39:41] >> So what Doug was talking
[00:39:42] about here, and he went on to
[00:39:44] explain, that it was this method
[00:39:46] of prototyping that helped him
[00:39:48] answer that question from his
[00:39:50] boss.
[00:39:51] Why should we put energy into
[00:39:53] your idea?
[00:39:54] So what Doug learned at his
[00:39:56] first design job was that he
[00:39:58] could not assume that his
[00:40:00] designs were going to work.
[00:40:01] And this actually also came up
[00:40:03] in my conversation with Gary.
[00:40:06] >> It wasn't just designed on
[00:40:07] paper, implemented in code, and
[00:40:10] sort of assumed that that was
[00:40:13] going to work.
[00:40:13] You can't just assume from your
[00:40:15] own experience and through
[00:40:18] chatting that something's going
[00:40:19] to work.
[00:40:20] You've really got to go out and
[00:40:20] try it.
[00:40:23] >> And I think this is the part
[00:40:24] that's really important not to
[00:40:25] overlook.
[00:40:27] You know, in this case, we are
[00:40:28] talking about trying designs in
[00:40:30] context out in the real world to
[00:40:32] vet solutions to problems, and
[00:40:35] trying solutions is something
[00:40:36] that Sam mentioned too.
[00:40:39] >> One of our ethos's is to
[00:40:42] solve a problem.
[00:40:43] Put it in front of players and
[00:40:45] see how they react.
[00:40:46] See if they're learning what
[00:40:47] they need to learn.
[00:40:47] And if we need to do more, we'll
[00:40:49] do more.
[00:40:50] It's impossible to rush the
[00:40:53] creative process of making a
[00:40:55] game because so much of what's
[00:40:57] special about the games that you
[00:40:58] remember are decisions that seem
[00:41:01] very obvious and very small but
[00:41:03] take a really, really long time
[00:41:05] to arrive at.
[00:41:06] And you can't hire more people
[00:41:08] to get there faster.
[00:41:09] You just have to sit with it and
[00:41:12] continue working on it until the
[00:41:13] best solutions arise.
[00:41:17] >> So Sam said something here
[00:41:18] that I want to expand on.
[00:41:21] More people are not going to fix
[00:41:22] a creative problem.
[00:41:24] Great artists are patient.
[00:41:27] Sometimes you just get writer's
[00:41:29] block and there's no amount of
[00:41:30] conversation that's going to fix
[00:41:32] it, so you have to wait and just
[00:41:34] let that creative process
[00:41:36] happen.
[00:41:37] And that's okay.
[00:41:38] It's a part of the process, and
[00:41:41] sometimes that's exactly what is
[00:41:42] needed to produce quality.
[00:41:44] So the theme really from these
[00:41:47] last 3 clips is to go out and
[00:41:50] try your designs in context with
[00:41:52] real people.
[00:41:54] Show people prototypes and learn
[00:41:55] from their feedback.
[00:41:57] This is a really essential
[00:41:58] technique to help work through
[00:42:00] your design decisions.
[00:42:01] So we can learn a lot from each
[00:42:05] other, so I wanted to know what
[00:42:07] advice would one designer give
[00:42:09] to another designer.
[00:42:11] >> Learn how to accept, and
[00:42:14] sort, and prioritize the
[00:42:16] feedback as it comes in, whether
[00:42:17] it's from yourself or from
[00:42:19] others.
[00:42:19] You will learn so much more
[00:42:21] quickly than if you are
[00:42:22] defensive and you just, like,
[00:42:23] buckle down.
[00:42:26] >> I personally struggle with
[00:42:27] this.
[00:42:28] I can almost not help becoming
[00:42:30] defensive when I hear feedback
[00:42:32] on a project I'm working on.
[00:42:33] It's like this instinctual
[00:42:35] reaction, especially if I just
[00:42:37] spent late nights and weekends
[00:42:38] working on something.
[00:42:41] But still, I know it's
[00:42:43] important, but I wanted to know
[00:42:46] why.
[00:42:46] Again, why is it important to be
[00:42:49] open to feedback?
[00:42:52] >> I think there's also just a
[00:42:53] reality, which is after you've
[00:42:55] used your own work for some
[00:42:57] amount of time, you naturally
[00:42:58] develop some blind spots.
[00:43:00] And that's where having a really
[00:43:01] great, collaborative team and
[00:43:03] people that you trust around you
[00:43:04] to help critique your work is a
[00:43:07] really important part of the
[00:43:07] design process.
[00:43:09] So you can get fresh eyes on
[00:43:10] stuff and trust that people have
[00:43:12] the good intentions and they're
[00:43:13] going to be able to give you
[00:43:14] great insights of how you can
[00:43:16] improve.
[00:43:17] >> Totally.
[00:43:18] I've been there.
[00:43:19] I've definitely been too close
[00:43:21] on a project and lost sight of a
[00:43:22] big picture or overlooked some
[00:43:24] detail.
[00:43:25] So by being open to feedback,
[00:43:28] it's really easy then to have
[00:43:30] someone else like your team or
[00:43:32] somebody that you asked a
[00:43:33] question to give you something,
[00:43:35] some piece of information that
[00:43:36] can help you improve your
[00:43:37] designs.
[00:43:39] And I really like that May-Li
[00:43:40] said this word, "trust," to
[00:43:42] trust the people around you.
[00:43:44] So be open to feedback.
[00:43:47] It makes everything better and
[00:43:48] just ups the overall quality of
[00:43:50] design in your work.
[00:43:53] So this next technique is more
[00:43:55] of a mindset, and it came up
[00:43:57] when I asked Cas, who works on
[00:43:59] platform patterns, "How do you
[00:44:01] approach designing for so many
[00:44:03] people?"
[00:44:03] >> Knowing what you don't know,
[00:44:08] in a way.
[00:44:08] What I mean is that if you're
[00:44:12] looking at these things or if
[00:44:13] you're designing for these
[00:44:14] things, obviously, you have
[00:44:16] ideas and ways of using a
[00:44:19] certain device or an app in your
[00:44:20] own way, in your own
[00:44:21] environment, in your own habits,
[00:44:23] and you might know a little bit
[00:44:24] about how your friends are using
[00:44:26] it, or how you've seen other
[00:44:27] people use it, or maybe feedback
[00:44:29] you're getting, but it's a
[00:44:30] really big world, and there's a
[00:44:32] lot of people out there, and
[00:44:34] they all have their own needs,
[00:44:35] their own habits, their own way
[00:44:38] of going through life.
[00:44:39] And so you have to be very
[00:44:40] mindful that how you think about
[00:44:42] things or your opinions are not
[00:44:43] always, first of all, correct
[00:44:45] ones, nor the only ones.
[00:44:49] >> I really like how Cas put
[00:44:50] this at the beginning -- know
[00:44:53] that you don't know.
[00:44:54] And he also used this word
[00:44:56] "modesty" through our
[00:44:57] conversation.
[00:44:58] To be unassuming when you're
[00:45:00] designing for so many people.
[00:45:03] And that is a really great
[00:45:05] headspace to be in when you're
[00:45:06] approaching design; to be modest
[00:45:09] and to be mindful.
[00:45:11] So how do you help keep people's
[00:45:14] experiences top of mind when
[00:45:16] you're designing?
[00:45:17] >> So in many ways, I just have
[00:45:19] to be skeptical and ask
[00:45:21] questions if the idea in front
[00:45:23] of me, is that going to work for
[00:45:25] someone in a wheelchair, for
[00:45:27] example?
[00:45:27] Is that going to work for
[00:45:28] someone that has never used this
[00:45:33] app before?
[00:45:33] Is it going to work for someone
[00:45:36] coming from a PC to a Mac?
[00:45:37] You just have to ask lots of
[00:45:39] questions, and it can just start
[00:45:41] people thinking about, oh, yeah,
[00:45:43] did I care enough to consider
[00:45:44] that aspect of it?
[00:45:47] >> Right. So this may seem
[00:45:49] really simple, but it's
[00:45:51] important to ask questions,
[00:45:54] especially from different
[00:45:55] perspectives.
[00:45:56] That's going to help you
[00:45:57] maintain quality throughout your
[00:45:58] work and keep those other
[00:46:00] people's experiences in mind.
[00:46:03] So design is a really
[00:46:05] collaborative process, and
[00:46:06] there's a lot that goes into
[00:46:08] making collaboration work.
[00:46:10] At one point or another, we're
[00:46:12] all going to start on a new
[00:46:13] project or a new team, so what
[00:46:15] helps make that process a little
[00:46:17] bit easier?
[00:46:20] >> I always like to set
[00:46:21] expectations upfront.
[00:46:22] I just say, hey, this is how I
[00:46:24] am.
[00:46:25] This is how I work.
[00:46:28] This is how I communicate.
[00:46:29] How do you work?
[00:46:30] How do you communicate?
[00:46:31] What's your preferred method of
[00:46:32] communication?
[00:46:33] And by the way, here's the goals
[00:46:36] that I think we are working
[00:46:38] toward.
[00:46:38] And here are the things that are
[00:46:39] important to me.
[00:46:40] And please share with me the
[00:46:42] same for you.
[00:46:43] And I'll always sort of say it
[00:46:45] with a caveat like, "We're going
[00:46:46] to get all this business out of
[00:46:47] the way, and we're going to
[00:46:48] speak very directly about it."
[00:46:53] >> I know for me, talking about
[00:46:55] communication can be awkward,
[00:46:57] but after I tried this
[00:46:59] technique, I learned that it
[00:47:00] helps avoid so much drama and
[00:47:03] confusion.
[00:47:04] So talk about communication,
[00:47:07] especially if you're working on
[00:47:08] teams.
[00:47:09] Work towards the same goal about
[00:47:11] creating something great.
[00:47:14] So really, these six techniques
[00:47:16] are all about caring about the
[00:47:18] other people and having tools to
[00:47:20] talk about it, and you have to
[00:47:22] care about other people and put
[00:47:24] yourself second.
[00:47:25] Be mindful of their lives and be
[00:47:27] modest about your own because we
[00:47:29] just learned you can't assume.
[00:47:31] You have to go out and try your
[00:47:33] designs through prototyping and
[00:47:35] also really remain open to
[00:47:36] feedback.
[00:47:37] That's essential to making
[00:47:39] progress in design because, as
[00:47:42] May-Li said, we all develop
[00:47:44] blind spots, and we're not only
[00:47:47] designing to make progress, but
[00:47:50] we want to get closer to
[00:47:51] reaching our own aspirations and
[00:47:52] our own goals.
[00:47:54] So these techniques are used by
[00:47:57] real designers that I talked to,
[00:47:59] and they help them go through
[00:48:00] the process of designing, and it
[00:48:02] makes their days a little bit
[00:48:03] easier, so I hope they can help
[00:48:06] you too.
[00:48:07] So after all of these
[00:48:09] interviews, I learned that
[00:48:12] quality is the result of time,
[00:48:15] effort, and care.
[00:48:17] It's considered, it's crafted,
[00:48:19] and it means something different
[00:48:21] to different people.
[00:48:23] I also learned that quality
[00:48:24] impacts our every day, that your
[00:48:27] intentions are truly felt.
[00:48:29] High quality evokes trust, and
[00:48:32] that's really important, as well
[00:48:34] as it has to be earned.
[00:48:36] It's also important to strive
[00:48:38] for simplicity, to aspire to be
[00:48:41] stunning, and design to be
[00:48:43] timeless.
[00:48:44] Just think about how your app or
[00:48:45] game can have a positive impact
[00:48:47] on people's lives.
[00:48:49] And finally, working towards
[00:48:51] quality is all about
[00:48:53] communication, collaboration,
[00:48:55] and understanding, especially
[00:48:57] understanding the people you are
[00:48:58] designing for.
[00:49:00] So really, quality is a
[00:49:02] principle.
[00:49:03] It is intentional, and it's
[00:49:06] something that you have to ask
[00:49:07] yourself, what does quality mean
[00:49:09] to you?
[00:49:10] And you need to know your
[00:49:11] interpretation to go forward, to
[00:49:14] put in that hard work that meets
[00:49:16] your expectations and hits your
[00:49:18] aspirations because, at the end
[00:49:21] of the day, you're not designing
[00:49:23] for you.
[00:49:24] You're designing for other
[00:49:25] people who are going to use your
[00:49:27] app or your game.
[00:49:29] So make great designs for them.
[00:49:32] Now, there are two important
[00:49:34] statements on quality in great
[00:49:35] design that stand alone.
[00:49:38] These are going to play back to
[00:49:39] back, and I hope each offers
[00:49:41] something different that you can
[00:49:42] take away from today.
[00:49:45] >> Sensing the human behind the
[00:49:49] experience I think is really an
[00:49:52] earmark of something great.
[00:49:58] >> A great design is going to be
[00:50:01] the product of tremendous amount
[00:50:02] of effort, and creativity, and
[00:50:04] skill, and [laughs] late nights.
[00:50:07] It's going to seem effortless,
[00:50:10] and it should hopefully recede
[00:50:12] in people's consciousness.
[00:50:14] And in a way, I think you're
[00:50:16] very aware of an interface which
[00:50:18] has been poorly designed, and
[00:50:20] you're not at all aware of an
[00:50:21] interface which has been well
[00:50:23] designed.
[00:50:28] >> So I talked to a lot of
[00:50:29] people, and I saved something
[00:50:31] special just for the end.
[00:50:34] Since I had the opportunity to
[00:50:35] talk to so many different
[00:50:37] designers, I had to ask them onw
[00:50:39] final question, and it's
[00:50:40] something that I've always
[00:50:42] wanted, wondered myself: What
[00:50:45] are designers' favorite colors?
[00:50:50] >> Oh, wow.
[00:50:52] >> My favorite color?
[00:50:53] >> I have to say--
[00:50:55] >> Is there such a thing?
[00:50:57] I don't think so.
[00:50:58] >> I would have said glitter,
[00:51:00] but it's not a color.
[00:51:01] >> One of the things that I
[00:51:02] really love is Tahitian blue.
[00:51:04] >> But colors to me are like
[00:51:06] moods, and I do not have the
[00:51:09] same mood every day.
[00:51:09] I don't think I even have the
[00:51:10] same mood every hour, so.
[00:51:12] >> I really like white.
[00:51:14] Is it really a color?
[00:51:15] I think that's one of the
[00:51:16] reasons why I like it.
[00:51:17] >> My favorite color has been
[00:51:18] amber.
[00:51:19] >> I mean, lately, it's been
[00:51:20] green for some reason.
[00:51:22] I don't know why.
[00:51:23] >> I got to go back on this
[00:51:25] answer.
[00:51:26] Oh, it's actually Pantone 347.
[00:51:29] >> My favorite color is blue.
[00:51:31] >> Like a happy blue, and blue
[00:51:33] is, like, always such a color of
[00:51:35] responsibility, which is, like,
[00:51:37] so me.
[00:51:38] >> But I just think it's, like,
[00:51:39] soft and friendly.
[00:51:42] And food that's pink tastes
[00:51:44] good.
[00:51:45] >> I'm going to go with red.
[00:51:46] >> Throw out a hex value.
[00:51:47] I don't have a favorite color.
[00:51:49] Every color's great.
[00:51:50] >> [laughs] All right, maybe
[00:51:53] I'll just answer for this moment
[00:51:55] in time.
[00:51:56] >> I don't wear any green.
[00:51:58] My car's not green.
[00:52:00] But I just like the idea of
[00:52:04] green.
[00:52:05] >> And I can't pick one because
[00:52:08] I wouldn't be able to pick a
[00:52:09] single musical note, so I'll use
[00:52:12] all of them where it makes
[00:52:14] sense.
[00:52:15] >> I'll need to check the spec
[00:52:17] on that, I think.
[00:52:19] System blue, of course.
[00:52:20] Yeah.
[00:52:26] >> Special thanks to everyone
[00:52:27] who participated in these
[00:52:28] interviews.
[00:52:29] Thank you all so much.
[00:52:30] Have a great WWDC.
