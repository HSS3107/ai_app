[00:00:00] this is Devin and he is here to steal
[00:00:02] your job your girl your dreams and your
[00:00:04] entire future Devon will finally fulfill
[00:00:06] the ancient Tech prophecy of nine
[00:00:08] developers delivering a newborn in one
[00:00:11] month Devin can reliably test an entire
[00:00:13] application with a single
[00:00:16] assert Devon doesn't follow best
[00:00:18] practices best practices follow
[00:00:20] Devon okay that's enough thanks to the
[00:00:23] promise of Sky High profit in our late
[00:00:25] stage capitalist World dein instantly
[00:00:28] became the wet dream of every venture
[00:00:30] capitalist and manager now they can
[00:00:31] finally replace these sacks of Flesh
[00:00:33] bones pimples and feelings with the
[00:00:35] clean cold Precision of a $500 monthly
[00:00:38] subscription this all sounds great on
[00:00:40] paper but there is one small issue
[00:00:42] despite the company behind the project
[00:00:44] raising $175 million at a $2 billion
[00:00:48] valuation Devin doesn't really work as
[00:00:50] advertised well don't get me wrong it
[00:00:52] works but it has the same results as a
[00:00:54] mentally checked out quietly quitting
[00:00:56] burnout developer who's forced to work
[00:00:58] overtime in a highly competitive
[00:01:00] environment under a charismatic
[00:01:01] Visionary genius a genius who was at
[00:01:04] some point the best Quake player in the
[00:01:05] US was ranked in the top 20 Diablo
[00:01:07] players in the world build one of the
[00:01:09] most powerful characters in Path of
[00:01:11] Exile 2 and is a well-rounded
[00:01:12] trustworthy chill guy Tech billionaire
[00:01:14] Elon Musk has challenged Russian
[00:01:17] President Vladimir Putin to a duel but I
[00:01:19] digress by all metrics Devon is just
[00:01:22] like the rest of us he takes hours to
[00:01:24] fix simple bugs works during the night
[00:01:26] to make up for procrastinating during
[00:01:27] the day and thanks to the excellent work
[00:01:29] from the internet of bugs Channel we
[00:01:31] know Deon commits spelling errors so
[00:01:33] that he can fix them later in the
[00:01:35] industry we call this ensuring your job
[00:01:37] security but Deon calls this efficiency
[00:01:40] the AI Revolution doesn't stop here just
[00:01:42] a few weeks back Jensen hang the CEO of
[00:01:44] Nvidia rocking what he thought to be an
[00:01:46] extremely cool looking jacket told the
[00:01:48] entire world that software departments
[00:01:50] will become aihr departments do you like
[00:01:52] my
[00:01:54] jacket is it just me or are all these
[00:01:56] big Tech billionaires more cringe than
[00:01:58] ever you know what they say despite the
[00:02:00] chain the newly found manly hobbies and
[00:02:02] the jenz broccoli haircut once a geek
[00:02:04] always a geek Venture capitalists rush
[00:02:07] to invest in similar Tech AI agents and
[00:02:09] companies gladly jumped on the hype
[00:02:10] train they announced hiring freezes to
[00:02:13] impress investors while continuing to
[00:02:15] hire and post new tech jobs all
[00:02:17] objective analysis shows that we are
[00:02:18] still far from AI agents that can
[00:02:20] reliably replace developers and that the
[00:02:22] most efficient model is a collaboration
[00:02:25] process where AI assists you in solving
[00:02:27] very specific tasks however we can't
[00:02:29] deny AI is on The Fast Track just today
[00:02:31] the newly elected Donald Trump together
[00:02:33] with the heads of open AI soft bank and
[00:02:35] Oracle announced Stargate a$ 500 billion
[00:02:38] private sector investment in AI
[00:02:40] infrastructure and this time around AI
[00:02:43] will not take jobs away it will create
[00:02:44] thousands of new ones instead the key
[00:02:47] takeaway of this video is not that your
[00:02:49] job as a developer is safe what you
[00:02:51] really need to understand is that with
[00:02:53] the right connections and enough
[00:02:54] confidence you too can become a
[00:02:56] successful snake oil salesman in the AI
[00:02:58] era probably in 2025 we at meta as well
[00:03:01] as the other companies that are
[00:03:02] basically working on this are going to
[00:03:04] have an AI that can effectively be
[00:03:07] a sort of mid-level engineer that you
[00:03:09] have at your company
