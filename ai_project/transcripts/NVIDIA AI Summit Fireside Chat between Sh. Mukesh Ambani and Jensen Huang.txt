[00:00:00] of data creating these models generating
[00:00:03] and producing intelligence and tokens at
[00:00:05] scale for all kinds of different
[00:00:07] Industries this is what we're seeing
[00:00:10] happening in front of our in front of us
[00:00:12] as we speak and so I hope to partner
[00:00:14] with all of you to enable India to be at
[00:00:18] the center of this new Industrial
[00:00:20] Revolution now to talk to you about some
[00:00:22] more of this and how it applies to India
[00:00:25] I have another special guest and you
[00:00:27] will surely know him as well and
[00:00:30] industry
[00:00:31] Pioneer an industry
[00:00:35] Pioneer someone someone we can genuinely
[00:00:39] said digit help digitalize India
[00:00:45] and yeah
[00:00:50] please and help build the fabric of the
[00:00:54] modern internet India that we know
[00:00:57] ladies and gentlemen mesh Amani
[00:01:08] my friend mesh how are you so good very
[00:01:11] nice to see you very very nice to see
[00:01:14] you please sit
[00:01:15] down well you know we've been this
[00:01:17] morning we've been talking about
[00:01:19] Ai and the last time you and I spent
[00:01:21] time together we were talking about Ai
[00:01:24] and uh the time before that we were
[00:01:25] talking about Ai and uh I now you could
[00:01:29] see we don't really have much to talk
[00:01:31] about aside from
[00:01:33] Ai and and
[00:01:36] um no one no one has contributed more
[00:01:40] Mukesh to help India become a high tech
[00:01:47] and a deep Tech India now you're at the
[00:01:50] beginning of that Journey you have great
[00:01:53] aspirations I know you have deep
[00:01:55] aspirations to help India become a deep
[00:01:58] tech industry and and uh what gives you
[00:02:01] that conviction and why is artificial
[00:02:03] intelligence that moment for
[00:02:07] India so Jensen first let me welcome you
[00:02:11] to our city of Mumbai a city with the
[00:02:15] large
[00:02:17] heart we are in what is the Geo World
[00:02:21] Center which is new which is built by my
[00:02:24] wife so if I don't say it's built by my
[00:02:26] wife I was instructed to say that
[00:02:31] I'm at her
[00:02:32] house in her house is bigger than your
[00:02:37] house and I thought your house was
[00:02:39] pretty big just so you know from mesha's
[00:02:43] house I could see my house in
[00:02:48] California so and you know while I was
[00:02:51] listening to you you talked about Nvidia
[00:02:56] being
[00:02:57] a exotic place
[00:03:00] and I was thinking that when you are in
[00:03:03] India I've got to give you my version of
[00:03:07] what uh Nvidia means to me and I was
[00:03:11] just thinking about it backstage there's
[00:03:13] a very important word link which is
[00:03:17] called Vidya p i d y a right and
[00:03:21] [Music]
[00:03:24] in in Indian in Hindi as we are all
[00:03:28] determined to make the best llm in Hindi
[00:03:33] right in Hindi Vidya means
[00:03:36] knowledge I knew I named the company
[00:03:41] right I knew it so everybody said Nvidia
[00:03:46] what a horrible name you will never make
[00:03:49] it so what it means I knew it I stuck
[00:03:52] with it so you you can take credit for
[00:03:54] this interpret gosh no problem right so
[00:03:58] it still is
[00:04:00] it it gets better Jensen so if we think
[00:04:04] about Vidya Vidya is sarasti and
[00:04:07] Saraswati is our goddess of knowledge so
[00:04:13] when you actually devote yourself
[00:04:17] sincerely to the goddess of knowledge
[00:04:21] and you acquire
[00:04:23] knowledge then in our tradition the
[00:04:26] goddess of prosperity which is Lakshmi
[00:04:35] follows so what you are doing 32 years
[00:04:39] ago I knew
[00:04:41] this so and now the story of Nvidia has
[00:04:44] been revealed to all of
[00:04:47] you so our first principles right are
[00:04:53] what you are driving thank you
[00:04:56] is the knowledge Revolution conver
[00:04:59] putting into the international into what
[00:05:02] I call the intelligence
[00:05:03] Revolution and that drives
[00:05:07] Prosperity across the world for all all
[00:05:10] the 8 billion people and I think that
[00:05:13] what we are at the doorsteps of is the
[00:05:17] new intelligence age and on behalf of
[00:05:21] everybody I very proud to have you as my
[00:05:24] friend and welcome to India and thank
[00:05:27] you for actually contributing to the
[00:05:30] world to bring the intelligence Age In
[00:05:34] Our Lifetime and
[00:05:37] hopefully together with everybody this
[00:05:41] can drive to more prosperity for all the
[00:05:44] 8 billion people in the world and
[00:05:46] particularly the 1 and a half billion
[00:05:49] people in
[00:05:51] [Applause]
[00:05:56] India mesha it is it is such an honor
[00:05:59] and such a great privilege and an
[00:06:01] incredible joy to be able to contribute
[00:06:03] in this way and and um as as you know uh
[00:06:10] the IT industry of India is world world
[00:06:13] renowned for its very large
[00:06:17] scale and not just in size but in deep
[00:06:20] expertise of computer science very few
[00:06:24] countries in the world has this natural
[00:06:26] resource this amazing natural resource
[00:06:29] called it
[00:06:30] and computer science
[00:06:31] expertise in the last couple of years
[00:06:34] we've been working together to upskill
[00:06:37] and we've now upscaled about
[00:06:39] 200,000 it professionals into the world
[00:06:42] of AI you know what what do we have to
[00:06:44] do together and how can we work together
[00:06:47] to help transform India at the speed of
[00:06:50] light really because everything is
[00:06:53] moving so fast to to to to transform
[00:06:57] India into a center not of just it but a
[00:07:01] center of
[00:07:03] AI so from my point of view uh Jensen
[00:07:08] let me tell you my own uh experience uh
[00:07:12] in
[00:07:13] India first right as our prime minister
[00:07:18] has said that this is a new aspirational
[00:07:24] India what we have today is we are among
[00:07:28] the only country in the world where the
[00:07:30] average age of 1.4 billion Indians is
[00:07:34] below
[00:07:35] 35 so what is driving our economy is not
[00:07:40] only new technologies like AI but also
[00:07:44] aspirations and I believe that uh you
[00:07:48] know the Prime Minister and I believe
[00:07:51] that his leadership in terms of
[00:07:55] converting India to a premier Digital
[00:07:58] Society has been vital and continues to
[00:08:03] drive activity at the ground level so
[00:08:06] it's demography it's
[00:08:08] leadership the third factor is that we
[00:08:14] as Indians have the raw talent you
[00:08:17] talked about converting 200,000 people
[00:08:20] into this but I believe there are
[00:08:22] millions right if we now see India has
[00:08:26] become home right among all the
[00:08:29] companies across the world we are our
[00:08:33] fastest in growing industry is global
[00:08:36] competency centers so we do space
[00:08:40] research in India we do pharmaceutical
[00:08:42] research in India I'm sure that you're
[00:08:45] thinking of building chips in India we
[00:08:49] are in our own energy industry we do bio
[00:08:53] energy industry all the energy major
[00:08:56] shell BP right actually do do their
[00:08:59] innovation in India MH so India is fast
[00:09:04] becoming a Innovation Hub for the world
[00:09:08] in terms of where we are and not the
[00:09:10] manufacturing
[00:09:13] house and and so you know we have we
[00:09:16] have over 10,000 Engineers here in India
[00:09:19] ourselves so that's like our challenge
[00:09:23] what we've also have
[00:09:26] is we also have what I call the
[00:09:30] necessary infrastructure and we've been
[00:09:33] fortunate that we have the connectivity
[00:09:38] infrastructure which I is equivalent to
[00:09:42] the roads so if you don't have roads you
[00:09:45] will not reach your destination so I
[00:09:47] believe that today apart from the US and
[00:09:52] China right India has the best digital
[00:09:56] connectivity infrastructure 4G 5 5G and
[00:10:00] Broadband in the world
[00:10:03] yeah when people talk about Gio and you
[00:10:08] know we said we goo took India from
[00:10:15] number8 in the world to number one in
[00:10:18] the world in 8
[00:10:24] years we as a single company didn't know
[00:10:28] anything about this domain right but
[00:10:32] today we are the largest data company in
[00:10:35] the world right yeah our volumes are
[00:10:39] equivalent to AT&T mobile and Verizon
[00:10:42] combined yeah
[00:10:52] so I I would I would say I would say uh
[00:10:56] uh size of local market is quite an
[00:11:01] advantage but let me tell you like the
[00:11:04] most satisfying piece and well having
[00:11:07] one and a half billion customers part
[00:11:09] the best part still coming that's pretty
[00:11:11] satisfying so the most satisfying piece
[00:11:15] is
[00:11:16] that as
[00:11:18] Gio we delivered about 16 exabytes of
[00:11:25] data this year we will deliver this year
[00:11:29] and the average in the US you pay $5 a
[00:11:34] GB in the world average for data is
[00:11:39] about $35 a
[00:11:42] GB in
[00:11:43] India Geo delivers data at 15 cents a
[00:11:50] GP and
[00:11:53] what and what that means is you don't do
[00:11:57] you encourage your customers to use use
[00:11:59] their phones we do and what really that
[00:12:03] means Jensen is a Perpetual value yeah
[00:12:07] right that technology has delivered
[00:12:10] customer value yeah of between 500 and
[00:12:14] 700 billion dollars a year year on year
[00:12:18] every year to Indians and this is the
[00:12:20] gift of technology to the people of
[00:12:22] India and this is what right what you
[00:12:26] described as intelligence
[00:12:29] we can do to
[00:12:32] actually bring prosperity to all the
[00:12:36] people and bring equality to the world
[00:12:38] and that is the opportunity why I
[00:12:40] described this and this is the reason
[00:12:44] that India will be one of the biggest
[00:12:47] intelligence markets and it's not only
[00:12:50] our aspirations but I think it is just
[00:12:55] the raw gene pool and the raw Gene power
[00:12:59] that exists in India the youth power
[00:13:01] that exists in India that is actually
[00:13:04] going
[00:13:05] to and drive intelligence and hopefully
[00:13:10] once we drive intelligence for our
[00:13:12] domestic market right yeah we will use
[00:13:17] intelligent Services Beyond software to
[00:13:21] integrate with the rest of the world
[00:13:23] right and Indians now will not only
[00:13:26] export CEOs to the world's largest
[00:13:28] companies but hundreds of millions of
[00:13:38] Indians it's it's true it's true all of
[00:13:41] my all of my colleagues all of my
[00:13:43] friends back home they're all
[00:13:45] Indians all all of my CEOs and and
[00:13:48] hundreds of millions will deliver to the
[00:13:51] world AI
[00:13:53] servic help a better world and uh that
[00:13:58] is why your being here thank you right
[00:14:01] is important your commitment to this
[00:14:03] country is important and working
[00:14:07] together right this cannot be done by
[00:14:09] any one company any one individual but
[00:14:13] we all have to work together to bring
[00:14:17] this intelligence age safely to the
[00:14:20] world so that we can create a more equal
[00:14:24] World a prosperous world and allow the
[00:14:27] global South to catch up with the rest
[00:14:30] of the world yeah that's really
[00:14:34] terrific and you know one one of the
[00:14:36] things that that that uh you you've
[00:14:39] highlighted is just the immense amount
[00:14:41] of Digital Data that's available um
[00:14:44] surely at Gio and in India and this is
[00:14:47] leads to leads to one of the things that
[00:14:50] I want to announce uh with you uh as you
[00:14:53] as you know in order to lead in
[00:14:55] artificial intelligence you need to have
[00:14:57] uh AI model technology that uh India has
[00:15:02] you need to have data massive quantities
[00:15:06] of data and using a uh the last thing
[00:15:10] you need is uh AI infrastructure and uh
[00:15:14] uh we're we're announcing that that
[00:15:16] Reliance and Nvidia are partnering uh to
[00:15:19] build AI infrastructure here in India
[00:15:25] absolutely uh and then and then the the
[00:15:28] thing that I will say is that in order
[00:15:30] ultimately to create that into a
[00:15:31] flywheel is one of the great advantages
[00:15:34] that India has which is a very large
[00:15:36] population of
[00:15:37] users and and so now you you have the
[00:15:40] fundamental ingredients uh
[00:15:43] AI data and AI infrastructure uh and you
[00:15:48] have a large population of users that
[00:15:50] ultimately creates your AI flywheel the
[00:15:54] thing that that I really love and um uh
[00:15:57] when I met modii the first time he asked
[00:16:00] me to meet his cabinet uh was to this
[00:16:03] this has got to be about six years ago
[00:16:05] he asked me to address this cabinet
[00:16:08] about artificial
[00:16:10] intelligence and I was so surprised it
[00:16:12] was the literally the first time any
[00:16:15] government leader uh any national
[00:16:17] leaders asked me to address uh his
[00:16:19] cabinet on um uh this particular topic
[00:16:22] it was long before anybody was talking
[00:16:23] about artificial intelligence and my
[00:16:25] last visit with him he said he said this
[00:16:27] and it was really quite profound he said
[00:16:30] I I was explaining to him uh the concept
[00:16:33] of uh AI infrastructure and why it's
[00:16:35] essential for every nation to have their
[00:16:38] own AI infrastructure like their own
[00:16:40] communication their internet
[00:16:41] infrastructure their roads uh energy of
[00:16:45] course and of course intelligence should
[00:16:48] be part of your infrastructure and the
[00:16:49] manufacturing of intelligence should be
[00:16:51] part of your infrastructure and and he
[00:16:53] said this he said he
[00:16:56] said it makes completely complete sense
[00:17:01] that India should
[00:17:04] manufacture its own AI manufacture your
[00:17:08] own AI you should not Outsource you
[00:17:11] should not export data to import
[00:17:14] intelligence that India should not
[00:17:16] export data to import intelligence and
[00:17:20] he
[00:17:21] said absolutely and and mo Modi said
[00:17:26] it's like India should not just export
[00:17:29] flour to import
[00:17:32] bread we should add value to the data
[00:17:36] ourselves and and uh and the partnership
[00:17:40] uh that we have is to start that journey
[00:17:42] to build the underlying infrastructure
[00:17:44] so that India could have your own
[00:17:46] infrastructure you surely have your own
[00:17:48] computer science expertise and you also
[00:17:51] have your data you have a giant
[00:17:53] population of users uh to to drive that
[00:17:56] flywheel and then one one more comment
[00:17:58] uh
[00:18:00] this is the thing that that that he was
[00:18:03] he was most inspired by uh six years ago
[00:18:05] he said he said that artificial
[00:18:07] intelligence has the ability to
[00:18:10] elevate um the entire population of
[00:18:13] India and the reason for that I was
[00:18:15] talking earlier to him about the fact
[00:18:18] that there are so few people in the
[00:18:20] world who knows how to program a
[00:18:24] computer programming is not easy uh here
[00:18:27] in India it's the lest population of any
[00:18:30] pro of programmers in the world however
[00:18:32] still programming is not easy most
[00:18:34] people don't know how to program python
[00:18:36] or C++ or you know Pascal or Fortran but
[00:18:39] or Java but everyone knows how to
[00:18:42] program an
[00:18:44] intelligence and so the ability to
[00:18:46] program computers is available to a
[00:18:48] small population but the ability to
[00:18:50] program AI is something that everyone
[00:18:53] can do and if if AI could be put into
[00:18:57] the hands of every citizen it would
[00:18:59] Elevate and put into the hands of
[00:19:02] everyone this incredible capability you
[00:19:04] and I get the benefit from called
[00:19:06] computers and this computer could now
[00:19:09] benefit everybody in society and and
[00:19:11] that he he explained that back to me
[00:19:14] absolutely and I think that that is why
[00:19:16] I started by saying that we are very
[00:19:19] fortunate to have a Visionary leader who
[00:19:23] believes not only in Vision but in
[00:19:27] execution yeah and where
[00:19:33] I and you know Jensen where I
[00:19:36] see our partnership and
[00:19:39] uh
[00:19:41] is really in a sense I was waiting for
[00:19:46] your gb2 200s to mature because like you
[00:19:50] from first principles I don't
[00:19:52] like uh doing anything but the best
[00:19:55] technology and now your gb2 200 right is
[00:20:00] undoubtedly the best technology I'm
[00:20:02] looking forward all of my technology is
[00:20:05] the best
[00:20:06] [Laughter]
[00:20:08] technology India India including the
[00:20:11] next one India will start with what is
[00:20:15] the absolute best that you have and I'm
[00:20:17] happy to like what we are doing at Jam
[00:20:21] nagar is we are now ready for big
[00:20:26] scaleup so we are building
[00:20:29] infrastructure right and we think big so
[00:20:32] we're building infrastructure for 1
[00:20:35] gwatt which can be expandable to
[00:20:37] multiple gws at one
[00:20:40] location we already have the green power
[00:20:44] so that we are not dependent on anybody
[00:20:48] else for Power we are building this so
[00:20:52] that we can scale this and as your
[00:20:56] multiple order of magnitude technology
[00:20:58] te Oles come we will build our
[00:21:01] infrastructure and uh we will one
[00:21:04] important piece that I believe is
[00:21:06] important is that for India and Indians
[00:21:11] right we have to repeat a Geo for
[00:21:13] intelligence to be really affordable
[00:21:17] available to the common people yeah
[00:21:24] and towards that it
[00:21:26] is important that we design and build
[00:21:30] infrastructure so that to use AI our
[00:21:35] customers don't have to change a phone
[00:21:37] don't have to change their computers but
[00:21:40] they can still get good quality Ai and
[00:21:44] we take the burden of putting that
[00:21:46] infrastructure together yeah and I think
[00:21:49] that is what uh we are counting on you
[00:21:52] and us to do on top of
[00:21:56] that I have again
[00:21:59] great respect for my friend Mark
[00:22:02] zukerberg
[00:22:03] because by bringing open
[00:22:06] source to the world of
[00:22:09] intelligence he has
[00:22:12] given you
[00:22:14] know everybody the opportunity to
[00:22:17] participate in this revolution Lama 3
[00:22:21] has activated every single company every
[00:22:23] single industry around the world it's
[00:22:24] incredible and what you have done with
[00:22:26] Lama 3 also right thank you is and all
[00:22:29] of us we can build on top of that and to
[00:22:33] my mind this move of Mark will be
[00:22:38] written in the history right when we
[00:22:40] look at it 100 years from now that open
[00:22:43] source all the big things in the world
[00:22:45] have have helped on open source like
[00:22:47] Linux was open source and I think that
[00:22:50] uh at least from India point of view we
[00:22:55] can use llama as a base model it allows
[00:22:59] all of us to develop on top of a state
[00:23:03] of the
[00:23:04] art uh model and surely then we can fine
[00:23:08] tune train retrain do everything else
[00:23:12] and I am sure that there is somebody in
[00:23:16] this audience who is very bright and
[00:23:18] very young and we will have right into
[00:23:22] the future an Indian model right as you
[00:23:25] very rightly said which might be 10x of
[00:23:27] Lama and that will happen from India and
[00:23:30] I hope and pray that our young people
[00:23:32] will do that but to start off with open
[00:23:35] source is great that's right on top of
[00:23:38] that right all your tools so The Foundry
[00:23:42] tools that we have we are looking
[00:23:45] forward to a Development Center where we
[00:23:49] take core of your tools and train
[00:23:52] hundreds of thousands of developers in
[00:23:54] India to use all the Enterprise tools to
[00:23:57] use the Omniverse verse tools so that we
[00:24:00] can really apply intelligence in a
[00:24:03] practical way and to me this is just the
[00:24:07] starting of this intelligence age it's a
[00:24:11] multi- decadal journey Kesh is talking
[00:24:13] like an
[00:24:15] engineer you guys listen listen to him
[00:24:19] go he's starting to sound like a 28-
[00:24:22] yearold engineer what do you guys
[00:24:24] think I like it I like it and that's
[00:24:29] that's what we're going to do together
[00:24:31] and uh true I can like assure you that
[00:24:35] like like we did in data in a few years
[00:24:39] from now right we will surprise the
[00:24:41] world with what India and Indians can
[00:24:43] achieve in the intelligence Market thank
[00:24:49] you mesh the it it will it will um uh
[00:24:55] certainly certainly we would agree that
[00:24:57] this is an extraordinary time for the
[00:25:01] world and this is an extraordinary
[00:25:03] opportunity for India um to have
[00:25:06] precisely the conditions that have such
[00:25:09] a large population and large industry of
[00:25:12] computer
[00:25:13] scientists at a time when this industry
[00:25:17] the Computing industry is going to
[00:25:18] become the intelligence
[00:25:20] industry leveraging on everything that
[00:25:22] you have leveraging on everything that
[00:25:24] you know and your indigenous
[00:25:29] Advantage enormous amounts of data a
[00:25:32] large population of consumers to drive
[00:25:35] that flywheel of intelligence to data
[00:25:38] data to intelligence intelligence to
[00:25:40] data and have the national will to go do
[00:25:43] something about it this is such an
[00:25:45] extraordinary time and I am honored and
[00:25:49] privileged to be partnered with you to
[00:25:51] do this and let's let's uh let's make it
[00:25:56] a promise today that that we will work
[00:25:59] together so that India could take
[00:26:01] advantage of the intelligence Revolution
