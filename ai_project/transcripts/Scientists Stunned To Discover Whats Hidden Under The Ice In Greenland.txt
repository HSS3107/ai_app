[00:00:02] Throughout history, our planet has been through
multiple ice ages and fully covered in ice
[00:00:07] at least twice.
[00:00:09] From the poles to the equator, the Earth was
a giant snowball at least several times.
[00:00:15] Today, the landscape has transformed, the
ice is starting to rapidly melt, and scientists
[00:00:21] are wondering what secrets could be concealed
beneath this frozen tundra.
[00:00:27] This is the second-largest ice sheet on Earth.
[00:00:30] It has an impressive thickness of nearly 2
miles [3.2 kilometers], covering 80% of the
[00:00:34] area of Greenland.
[00:00:36] Here, rapid glaciers like Jakobshavn move
at an astonishing 150 feet [45 meters] per
[00:00:42] day, reshaping the landscape, while coastal
waters create icebergs towering 300 feet [90
[00:00:48] meters], about the height of the Statue of
Liberty.
[00:00:51] But these things are not what makes the island
unique.
[00:00:55] To this day, the frozen surface hides all
kinds of secrets.
[00:00:59] But scientists have already started uncovering
some of them, and what they’ve found was
[00:01:03] difficult to predict…
[00:01:10] [LOGO]
[00:01:15] Although Greenland is [836,000 square miles
2.17 million square kilometers] over 3 times
[00:01:17] the size of Texas, its total population is
just 56,000 people – the lowest population
[00:01:23] density in the world.
[00:01:26] Frigid temperatures make the majority of the
island uninhabitable.
[00:01:30] But along the southwest coast, the warming
effect of the Gulf Stream results in moderate
[00:01:35] temperatures, creating a comfortable habitat.
[00:01:38] That’s where the third of the population
resides.
[00:01:42] In the central part of Greenland, temperatures
remain below zero at all times.
[00:01:46] The snow there never melts, gradually accumulating
instead.
[00:01:51] When new snow falls on the Greenland Ice Sheet,
it’s initially light and fluffy, with a
[00:01:55] density about 50-70 kilograms per cubic meter.
[00:01:59] As it gets covered with new layers, all this
weight compresses the layers below, increasing
[00:02:05] their density.
[00:02:06] At a depth of over 260 feet [80 meters], air
bubbles within the snow cannot compress any
[00:02:11] further, and snow solidifies into glacier
ice.
[00:02:16] In total, there’s 695,000 cubic miles [2.9
million cubic kilometers] of ice in Greenland,
[00:02:21] which is thought to have been there for hundreds
of thousands to millions of years.
[00:02:25] But Greenland wasn’t always frozen.
[00:02:28] Beneath its icy cover lies a colossal rocky
island that was once a flourishing haven where
[00:02:34] life thrived amidst valleys, rivers, and numerous
lakes.
[00:02:39] Even today, not all of Greenland is ice-covered.
[00:02:43] Moving to the southernmost reaches of Greenland,
there’s the Qinngua Valley – the only
[00:02:48] forested area on the island.
[00:02:50] As temperatures continue to rise, it’s possible
that this green patch of land will trigger
[00:02:55] the spread of vegetation to other parts of
the island, gradually making it green again.
[00:03:01] In 1966, US military scientists drilled through
nearly a mile of ice in northwestern Greenland,
[00:03:08] discovering a once-green past.
[00:03:10] They found twigs, leaves, and unique, perfectly
preserved fossil plants.
[00:03:17] Scientists describe their state as freeze-dried.
[00:03:20] If you pour some water on them, they unfurl,
looking almost as if they were frozen just
[00:03:24] yesterday.
[00:03:26] About 400,000 years ago, parts of Greenland
had spruce forests and tundra — a flat,
[00:03:32] cold and windy area without trees, but with
resilient low-lying plants.
[00:03:38] Today, all this serves as a time capsule,
allowing us to peek into Greenland's ancient
[00:03:44] ecosystems.
[00:03:46] Greenland's thick ice sheet acts as an insulator
– the ground beneath remains shielded from
[00:03:51] the frigid temperatures and winds above.
[00:03:53] Meanwhile, the Earth’s internal heat warms
the ground from below.
[00:03:57] In some areas, the ice sheet is firmly attached
to frozen ground, providing stability.
[00:04:03] But closer to the edges of the ice sheet,
where it's thinner, the base has thawed, and
[00:04:07] the ice is laying over a moist soil.
[00:04:11] If there's enough water beneath, it can make
the ice flow faster.
[00:04:14] And this more rapid flow rate can potentially
accelerate melting rate.
[00:04:20] Currently the ice sheet in Greenland melts
away at a rate of over 200 billion tons per
[00:04:25] year – enough to fill almost 91 million
Olympic Swimming Pools which hold 660,430
[00:04:33] gallons of water each!
[00:04:35] And if it melts entirely, the global sea level
will rise approximately 23 feet [7 meters],
[00:04:41] causing devastating damage to millions of
people who live along the world’s coasts.
[00:04:46] According to a study made in 2019, around
680 million people reside in low-lying coastal
[00:04:52] regions.
[00:04:53] By 2050, this number could surpass well over
a billion.
[00:04:58] Right now, Greenland loses more ice than it
accumulates.
[00:05:02] Although, it will probably take a long time
for all the ice to melt.
[00:05:06] The staggering magnitude of the ice sheet
is hard to grasp – its weight has built
[00:05:11] so much pressure that it led to a depression
in the central part of the island 1000 feet
[00:05:17] [300 meters] below sea level.
[00:05:19] And the same thing happened about 20,000 years
ago – a colossal weight pushed parts of
[00:05:25] Earth lower into the crust.
[00:05:27] Ice sheets were all over the world: Scandinavia,
the Arctic, and a large part of the USA and
[00:05:33] Canada were all covered in ice.
[00:05:36] And currently, something interesting happens
to these areas.
[00:05:39] Think of our planet's surface as a massive,
shape memory mattress.
[00:05:43] Press down on it, and it'll compress, but
once you remove the pressure, it'll slowly
[00:05:48] start going back to its initial form.
[00:05:51] In a similar way, as ice sheets shrink, the
land under the ice rises, while the neighboring
[00:05:56] territories adjust by sinking.
[00:05:59] This process is very slow, and some regions
are still recovering, while others like the
[00:06:04] United States East Coast will continue sinking
for thousands of years.
[00:06:09] Compared to other parts of the Earth, regions
like these are at a much higher risk of higher
[00:06:14] sea levels.
[00:06:16] Today, Greenland is anything but green.
[00:06:20] But scientists have already been able to have
a look underneath its ice cover, revealing
[00:06:25] what the island’s been hiding for centuries.
[00:06:28] In 2013, a new canyon was discovered.
[00:06:31] It’s over 460 miles [750 kilometers] long,
6 miles [10 kilometers] wide, and about 2,600
[00:06:37] feet [800 meters] deep.
[00:06:38] This makes it more than one and a half times
longer than the Grand Canyon in Arizona [277
[00:06:43] miles 446 kilometers].
[00:06:44] Up to this date, it’s the longest canyon
ever found on Earth.
[00:06:48] Although you can’t see it just yet, the
canyon is buried beneath billions of tons
[00:06:52] of ice.
[00:06:54] The subglacial canyon was probably once the
channel of a massive river, created by frequent
[00:06:59] flood events that pushed water through the
bedrock some 2 million years ago.
[00:07:04] And it can still carry melted water deep below
the ice sheet and into the sea.
[00:07:09] Once, Greenland even had a massive lake, covering
an area [2,700 square miles 7,000 square km]
[00:07:13] as large as Rhode Island and Delaware combined.
[00:07:17] It drew water from at least 18 streams, reaching
depths of 800 feet [250 meters].
[00:07:22] Today, the ancient lake is a depression filled
with sediment, holding secrets of a time when
[00:07:27] it was water, instead of ice, that shaped
Greenland's landscape.
[00:07:31] Decades of ice-penetrating radar surveys revealed
a network of mountain ranges, extending thousands
[00:07:37] of meters above sea level.
[00:07:39] Their sharp ridges and deep valleys affect
the movement of the massive ice sheet above,
[00:07:44] which takes on the shape of the hidden mountainous
terrain.
[00:07:48] And then, there are submerged fjords – hundreds
to over a thousand meters deep channels carved
[00:07:53] by the glacial forces.
[00:07:56] Greenland's glaciers are constantly moving,
and how and where they go depends on the subglacial
[00:08:01] mountains that act like obstacles.
[00:08:04] They guide the flow of the melting ice, changing
its speed and direction.
[00:08:09] And fjords are like pathways that icebergs
follow to escape into the ocean.
[00:08:16] The island’s icy veil doesn’t only hide
a mysterious past, but also a rich reservoir
[00:08:22] of natural resources.
[00:08:24] Geological surveys suggest the presence of
rare earth elements and precious metals.
[00:08:29] Elements found in Greenland's bedrock, such
as neodymium, dysprosium, and europium are
[00:08:35] crucial in the production of modern electronics,
renewable energy technologies, and different
[00:08:40] high-tech applications.
[00:08:42] The island's subglacial terrain could also
harbor precious metals, such as gold, silver,
[00:08:48] and platinum.
[00:08:49] But also, there’s water, and a lot of it.
[00:08:53] Locked within the vast expanses of the Antarctic
and Greenland Ice Sheets, it holds more than
[00:08:58] 68% of the Earth's freshwater supply.
[00:09:03] Greenland's unique geological features hold
massive potential for geothermal energy development
[00:09:08] – a sustainable alternative to traditional
energy sources.
[00:09:12] The idea is to harness heat from Earth's interior
that escapes to the surface.
[00:09:17] The process is known as heat flow, and the
area along Greenland's west coast shows heat
[00:09:23] flow three times higher than the island's
average.
[00:09:27] Unlike fossil fuels, geothermal power generation
produces minimal greenhouse gas emissions.
[00:09:32] Perhaps, one day, Greenland will be humanity's
ticket to a carbon-free lifetime.
[00:09:39] All this makes Greenland a treasure trove
of valuable resources.
[00:09:42] But it’s also a place where Mother Nature
reveals just how creative it can be.
[00:09:47] In 2010, scientists stumbled across peculiar
formations beneath the Greenland ice sheet.
[00:09:53] At first, they thought these might be Ghost
Mountains, like those found in Antarctica.
[00:09:58] But as it turned out later, they were wrong.
[00:10:03] Known as jellyroll sculptures, they are icy
formations [Height: 3,000 feet 900 meters
[00:10:06] Thickness: 3,300 feet 1,000 meters] as big
as Manhattan’s skyscrapers, and there are
[00:10:09] dozens of them in Greenland.
[00:10:12] Just imagine how vast the space between the
island’s icy cover and its bedrock should
[00:10:16] be to fit something this massive.
[00:10:19] The gigantic features are made of an unusual
ice – it doesn’t consist of layers, but
[00:10:24] is rather twisted or rolled, and it can be
as old as 120,000 years.
[00:10:31] Using radar imaging, researchers discovered
that jellyroll sculptures can be found just
[00:10:36] 0.6 miles [1 kilometer] below Greenland's
white landscape.
[00:10:39] The island was long considered like a layered
cake, but one that’s made of snow.
[00:10:43] Although as you go deeper, peeling off layer
after layer, at some point, they are no longer
[00:10:48] flat.
[00:10:49] The ice down there looks more like it’s
been bent or folded several times.
[00:10:53] Now, there’s a lot of science behind how
it happens, but in simple terms, ice grows
[00:10:59] from the bottom up when the ice sheet melts
and refreezes.
[00:11:03] It’s somewhat like building a sand castle
– the wet sand you pour solidifies at the
[00:11:08] base, adding substance to the lower layers.
[00:11:11] Similarly, the refrozen ice adds to the layers,
creating a complex, folded structure beneath
[00:11:16] the seemingly flat surface that’s been forming
for hundreds or even thousands of years.
[00:11:22] But deep below the mighty ice sheet, there’s
something much, much older.
[00:11:27] Back when Greenland was still a temperate
rainforest, the island was struck by an asteroid
[00:11:32] 0.9 miles across [1.5 kilometers].
[00:11:34] The impact was probably millions of times
more powerful than an atomic bomb – enough
[00:11:39] to cause earthquakes of magnitude 9 and massive
wildfires.
[00:11:43] Luckily, it all happened after the dinosaurs
had already gone extinct, and long before
[00:11:48] the first humans.
[00:11:50] The asteroid left behind what’s known today
as a 19-mile [31-kilometer] wide Hiawatha
[00:11:55] crater, which is currently sitting below 3,000
feet [900 meters] of ice.
[00:12:00] Discovered in 2018, its location played a
significant role.
[00:12:04] The crater is lying under the northwestern
edge of the ice sheet; the flowing stream
[00:12:08] from below the sheet contained sediments that
suggested they were once exposed to rapid
[00:12:13] and extreme heating.
[00:12:14] By studying sand grains, researchers determined
just how long ago the impact took place – a
[00:12:20] mind-blowing 58 million years ago.
[00:12:26] Greenland stands as one of the Earth's most
extraordinary landscapes, guarding the mysteries
[00:12:30] of our planet's past.
[00:12:32] We have barely scratched the surface of this
barren terrain, but in years to come, countless
[00:12:37] studies will be conducted.
[00:12:39] And who knows what other secrets may lie dormant
beneath the vast expanse of ice, waiting to
[00:12:45] be unveiled…
[00:12:46] What secrets might this almost alien expanse
of land hide?
[00:12:50] Clues to our planet's future, extraordinary
species of animals, or even a long-lost civilization?
[00:12:56] Let us know in the comments section below.
[00:12:59] Stay tuned for more thrilling discoveries
