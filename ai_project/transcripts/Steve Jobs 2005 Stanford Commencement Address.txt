[00:00:22] Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement
[00:00:30] from one of the finest universities in the world.
[00:00:35] Truth be told I never graduated from college
[00:00:41] and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
[00:00:47] Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.
[00:00:52] No big deal. Just three stories.
[00:00:55] The first story is about connecting the dots.
[00:01:01] I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,
[00:01:03] but then stayed around as a drop-in
[00:01:05] for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
[00:01:09] So why did I drop out?
[00:01:12] It started before I was born.
[00:01:15] My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,
[00:01:19] and she decided to put me up for adoption.
[00:01:22] She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,
[00:01:26] so everything was all set for me to
[00:01:28] be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
[00:01:31] Except that when I popped out they decided
[00:01:34] at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
[00:01:37] So my parents, who were on a waiting list,
[00:01:40] got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected
[00:01:44] baby boy; do you want him?"
[00:01:47] They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that
[00:01:53] my mother had never graduated from college
[00:01:55] and that my father had never graduated from high school.
[00:01:59] She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
[00:02:03] She only relented a few months later when
[00:02:05] my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.
[00:02:12] And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college
[00:02:19] that was almost as expensive as Stanford,
[00:02:22] and all of my working-class parents'
[00:02:24] savings were being spent on my college tuition.
[00:02:27] After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
[00:02:30] I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life
[00:02:32] and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
[00:02:36] And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved
[00:02:40] their entire life.
[00:02:42] So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
[00:02:46] It was pretty scary at the time,
[00:02:49] but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
[00:02:54] The minute I dropped out I could stop
[00:02:56] taking the required classes that didn't interest me,
[00:02:59] and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
[00:03:04] It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,
[00:03:08] so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,
[00:03:10] I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with,
[00:03:14] and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday
[00:03:17] night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna
[00:03:21] temple. I loved it.
[00:03:23] And much of what I stumbled into by following
[00:03:26] my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
[00:03:29] Let me give you one example: Reed College at that
[00:03:34] time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
[00:03:38] Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,
[00:03:42] was beautifully hand calligraphed.
[00:03:45] Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,
[00:03:49] I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
[00:03:53] I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,
[00:03:56] about varying the amount of space
[00:03:57] between different letter combinations,
[00:03:59] about what makes great typography great.
[00:04:03] It was beautiful, historical,
[00:04:05] artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,
[00:04:09] and I found it fascinating.
[00:04:12] None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
[00:04:17] But ten years later,
[00:04:18] when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
[00:04:21] it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.
[00:04:25] It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
[00:04:29] If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,
[00:04:32] the Mac would have never had multiple
[00:04:34] typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
[00:04:37] And since Windows just copied the Mac,
[00:04:39] it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
[00:04:47] If I had never dropped out,
[00:04:51] I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,
[00:04:54] and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography
[00:04:57] that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect
[00:05:00] the dots looking forward when I was in college.
[00:05:02] But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.
[00:05:07] Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;
[00:05:10] you can only connect them looking backwards.
[00:05:12] So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect
[00:05:15] in your future.
[00:05:16] You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,
[00:05:20] whatever.
[00:05:22] Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart
[00:05:28] Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.
[00:05:38] My second story is about love and loss.
[00:05:44] I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.
[00:05:48] Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.
[00:05:51] We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of
[00:05:55] us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
[00:05:59] We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh
[00:06:03] a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.
[00:06:06] And then I got fired.
[00:06:09] How can you get fired from a company you started?
[00:06:12] Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought
[00:06:15] was very talented to run the company with me,
[00:06:18] and for the first year or so things went well.
[00:06:20] But then our visions of the future began
[00:06:22] to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
[00:06:25] When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.
[00:06:29] So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.
[00:06:32] What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,
[00:06:35] and it was devastating.
[00:06:38] I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
[00:06:41] I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs
[00:06:43] down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.
[00:06:47] I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce
[00:06:50] and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
[00:06:54] I was a very public failure,
[00:06:55] and I even thought about running away from the valley.
[00:06:58] But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.
[00:07:03] The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
[00:07:07] I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
[00:07:12] And so I decided to start over.
[00:07:14] I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from
[00:07:17] Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
[00:07:21] The heaviness of being successful was
[00:07:23] replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,
[00:07:26] less sure about everything.
[00:07:27] It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
[00:07:31] During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,
[00:07:34] another company named Pixar,
[00:07:35] and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.
[00:07:39] Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature
[00:07:42] film, Toy Story,
[00:07:44] and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
[00:07:49] In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,
[00:07:53] I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at
[00:07:56] NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
[00:07:59] And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.
[00:08:03] I'm pretty sure none of this would
[00:08:05] have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.
[00:08:08] It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.
[00:08:12] Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.
[00:08:18] I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved
[00:08:21] what I did. You've got to find what you love.
[00:08:24] And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.
[00:08:28] Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
[00:08:30] and the only way to be truly satisfied
[00:08:32] is to do what you believe is great work.
[00:08:35] And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
[00:08:38] If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
[00:08:43] As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
[00:08:47] And, like any great relationship,
[00:08:49] it just gets better and better as the years roll on.
[00:08:52] So keep looking. Don't settle.
[00:09:05] My third story is about death.
[00:09:09] When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:
[00:09:12] "If you live each day as if it was your last,
[00:09:15] someday you'll most certainly be right."
[00:09:20] It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,
[00:09:25] I have looked in the mirror every morning
[00:09:27] and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,
[00:09:30] would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
[00:09:34] And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row,
[00:09:37] I know I need to change something.
[00:09:40] Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important
[00:09:43] tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
[00:09:47] Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride,
[00:09:52] all fear of embarrassment or failure -
[00:09:54] these things just fall away in the face of death,
[00:09:58] leaving only what is truly important.
[00:10:00] Remembering that you are going to die is the best
[00:10:03] way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
[00:10:08] You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
[00:10:13] About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:10:16] I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,
[00:10:20] and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
[00:10:23] I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
[00:10:26] The doctors told me this was almost
[00:10:28] certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,
[00:10:30] and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
[00:10:35] My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
[00:10:40] which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
[00:10:42] It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought
[00:10:47] you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.
[00:10:51] It means to make sure everything is buttoned
[00:10:53] up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
[00:10:56] It means to say your goodbyes.
[00:11:01] I lived with that diagnosis all day.
[00:11:04] Later that evening I had a biopsy,
[00:11:06] where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,
[00:11:08] through my stomach and into my intestines,
[00:11:11] put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
[00:11:14] I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,
[00:11:18] told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope
[00:11:21] the doctors started crying because it turned out to be
[00:11:24] a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
[00:11:29] I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.
[00:11:40] This was the closest I've been to facing death,
[00:11:43] and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.
[00:11:46] Having lived through it,
[00:11:48] I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when
[00:11:51] death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:
[00:11:55] No one wants to die.
[00:11:58] Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
[00:12:02] And yet death is the destination we all share.
[00:12:06] No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,
[00:12:10] because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.
[00:12:15] It is Life's change agent.
[00:12:16] It clears out the old to make way for the new.
[00:12:19] Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,
[00:12:24] you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
[00:12:28] Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
[00:12:32] Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
[00:12:38] Don't be trapped by dogma which is living
[00:12:40] with the results of other people's thinking.
[00:12:42] Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner
[00:12:46] voice. And most important,
[00:12:48] have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
[00:12:51] They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
[00:12:55] Everything else is secondary.
[00:13:09] When I was young,
[00:13:11] there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,
[00:13:15] which was one of the bibles of my generation.
[00:13:18] It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here
[00:13:21] in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.
[00:13:25] This was in the late 1960's,
[00:13:27] before personal computers and desktop publishing,
[00:13:30] so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
[00:13:34] It was sort of like Google in paperback form,
[00:13:36] 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,
[00:13:41] overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.
[00:13:45] Stewart and his team put out several
[00:13:47] issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,
[00:13:48] and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.
[00:13:53] It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
[00:13:58] On the back cover of their final issue
[00:14:00] was a photograph of an early morning country road,
[00:14:04] the kind you might find yourself
[00:14:05] hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
[00:14:08] Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
[00:14:13] It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.
[00:14:18] Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.
[00:14:23] And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
[00:14:28] Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
[00:14:31] Thank you all very much.
