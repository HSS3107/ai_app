[00:00:10] head of Outreach at y combinator so I've
[00:00:14] been at YC for about nine years now and
[00:00:16] that means I've seen over 3 500
[00:00:18] companies go through the program and
[00:00:20] launch at YC one of the things my team
[00:00:23] does is help companies with their first
[00:00:25] launches and today I want to change the
[00:00:28] way you think about launching most
[00:00:31] Founders overthink their first launch
[00:00:33] they think they have just one shot at
[00:00:36] launching their product publicly and
[00:00:38] that the messaging has to be perfect or
[00:00:40] that no one will ever buy or use or
[00:00:44] invest in their product
[00:00:45] I talked to Founders constantly who
[00:00:48] lovingly prepare their launch for months
[00:00:51] but if you're like most startups you'll
[00:00:54] launch something and no one will care
[00:00:56] and if it takes you six months to get
[00:00:58] the first version of your product in
[00:01:00] front of anyone your startup may be dead
[00:01:02] before you get another chance to launch
[00:01:04] So In The Same Spirit of always be
[00:01:07] shipping I want you to think about
[00:01:09] launching as something that you do
[00:01:11] continually so here's what we're going
[00:01:13] to talk about today first we'll talk
[00:01:15] about when to launch and why second
[00:01:17] we'll walk through some strong one-line
[00:01:19] company descriptions including some that
[00:01:22] I pulled from the startup School
[00:01:23] community and third we'll talk about the
[00:01:25] types of launches you can do during
[00:01:27] startup school so first a lot of people
[00:01:30] ask when should I launch and the answer
[00:01:33] is ASAP it's probably right now why so
[00:01:38] Founders are really good at lying to
[00:01:41] themselves a lot of you have really
[00:01:43] strong convictions about what you're
[00:01:45] building and that's good Founders need
[00:01:48] that conviction but many of you have
[00:01:50] strong but theoretical Notions of how
[00:01:53] you're going to solve a problem and how
[00:01:55] people are going to interact with what
[00:01:57] you're building so putting your product
[00:01:59] out there even in its earliest state
[00:02:01] will help you determine whether you're
[00:02:03] solving a big enough problem that
[00:02:05] someone is willing to pay for you or use
[00:02:07] you even in the products really
[00:02:10] unpolished state so if you launch too
[00:02:13] early what's the worst case scenario
[00:02:16] what's the worst thing that can happen
[00:02:17] people might think the product is ugly
[00:02:20] or it sucks investors might hear about
[00:02:23] the product before it's ready you know
[00:02:24] competitors might see it or Worse no one
[00:02:28] will see it or no one will care and
[00:02:30] that's fine just launch again
[00:02:33] Airbnb launched three times before they
[00:02:36] really started to get users launching
[00:02:38] and having no one care that feels
[00:02:40] terrible but it's not a reason to give
[00:02:42] up it's a reason to iterate and launch
[00:02:45] again launch and iterate launch and
[00:02:48] iterate until you have a core of users
[00:02:50] who really love you Paul Buchheit he's
[00:02:53] the creator of Gmail and a long time YC
[00:02:56] group partner he has said it's better to
[00:02:58] make a few people really happy than to
[00:03:01] make a lot of people semi-happy
[00:03:04] so early on as long as you've made
[00:03:06] something that a few users absolutely
[00:03:09] love you are on the right track it'll be
[00:03:13] good for your morale to have even a
[00:03:14] handful of users who really love what
[00:03:16] you're doing and it'll help you figure
[00:03:19] out what to focus on
[00:03:20] what is it about your product that they
[00:03:22] love and how can you do more of that
[00:03:25] where can you find more users who love
[00:03:28] that sort of thing that you're doing if
[00:03:30] you have a core of users even 10 users
[00:03:32] who really love you all you have to do
[00:03:34] is expand that number and it might take
[00:03:36] a while but if you keep going cockroach
[00:03:39] style you can win in the end so now that
[00:03:42] we've determined you should all launch
[00:03:44] let's talk about something every one of
[00:03:47] you needs before you launch to create a
[00:03:50] strong one sentence pitch you need
[00:03:53] Clarity of vision
[00:03:54] we believe that people who have thought
[00:03:56] deeply and about about an idea can
[00:03:59] explain it clearly and succinctly they
[00:04:02] use less words they can explain con
[00:04:05] complex Concepts in a way that a
[00:04:07] five-year-old can understand and having
[00:04:09] a clear idea is important because a
[00:04:12] clear idea is the best foundation for
[00:04:14] growth the best companies and movements
[00:04:17] grow organically by word of mouth and
[00:04:20] that's good news because Word of Mouth
[00:04:22] growth is the cheapest way to grow and
[00:04:24] if you think back to the first time you
[00:04:26] heard about something like say tick tock
[00:04:27] or a slack there's a good chance you've
[00:04:30] heard about it through a friend or
[00:04:32] co-worker talking about what you do
[00:04:34] clearly and succinctly is going to be
[00:04:36] one of your most important jobs as a
[00:04:38] Founder it's a skill that you'll need to
[00:04:41] convince potential co-founders investors
[00:04:44] users employees and eventually hopefully
[00:04:47] shareholders to believe in you it's also
[00:04:50] a skill you'll need to grow to grow you
[00:04:52] need to get all these groups of people
[00:04:53] talking about you to help you spread the
[00:04:56] word that's why it's necessary to make
[00:04:58] it easy for anyone your grandfather or
[00:05:00] the person that you meet at the airport
[00:05:02] to talk about what you're doing so that
[00:05:05] word can spread about you virally when
[00:05:07] people sit down at the dinner table they
[00:05:09] should be talking about you and your
[00:05:11] company and you don't have to be
[00:05:13] naturally good at talking about your
[00:05:14] company at first it takes some of our
[00:05:16] Founders at YC months to get comfortable
[00:05:18] doing this so here's how we think about
[00:05:20] coming up with a short memorable
[00:05:22] description of your company so first we
[00:05:25] recommend leading with what not with why
[00:05:28] and this may seem counterintuitive
[00:05:31] because we tell most stories
[00:05:33] chronologically it's natural to start
[00:05:36] with you know how you discover the
[00:05:38] problem you're solving and why it's
[00:05:40] important
[00:05:41] and one reason a lot of you do this is
[00:05:43] because you're all very ambitious people
[00:05:45] and you want to solve these big problems
[00:05:47] and that's really awesome and Founders
[00:05:49] need that ambition but
[00:05:51] when you only have a limited time with
[00:05:54] someone it's important to give them
[00:05:55] context up front so start with the
[00:05:58] company name and what you do and there's
[00:06:00] no need to set up the problem just get
[00:06:02] to the point so I'll use a real example
[00:06:05] from a YC companies application the
[00:06:07] company is called pave if they'd started
[00:06:09] with why they were building this company
[00:06:11] they would have said many of my friends
[00:06:13] are super confused about their stock
[00:06:15] options and it pisses me off how
[00:06:18] stressed they get thinking about them
[00:06:19] but before you give me the back story
[00:06:21] again start with one sentence that tells
[00:06:23] me what you're building First Press
[00:06:25] people and investors and even other
[00:06:28] Founders get pitched tens of times per
[00:06:31] you know per day definitely per week and
[00:06:34] they have particularly short attention
[00:06:36] spans so here's the actual description
[00:06:39] of the company pave pave lets companies
[00:06:41] plan communicate and Benchmark your
[00:06:44] compensation in real time this is a
[00:06:47] straightforward description of what
[00:06:48] they're building and who they're
[00:06:49] building for they are building 2 tools
[00:06:52] to make compensation and pay more
[00:06:54] transparent for companies uh and and
[00:06:57] their employees so hopefully whoever
[00:06:59] you're talking to asks follow-up
[00:07:02] questions and then you can get to the
[00:07:04] why later so the second mistake Founders
[00:07:07] make is adding a lot of meaningless
[00:07:09] marketing speak to their pitches so this
[00:07:11] is a tweet from Gary tan he said
[00:07:13] meaningless jargon is the number one
[00:07:16] issue I spend time trying to fight when
[00:07:18] helping startups so here is an actual
[00:07:21] description of a company don't worry
[00:07:23] it's not a startup School company or a
[00:07:25] YC company indiecloud is a know-how and
[00:07:28] Synergy platform don't say like
[00:07:31] this it has zero informational content
[00:07:33] about what you actually do when you're
[00:07:36] describing your company the person
[00:07:38] you're talking to should have some idea
[00:07:40] of you know what they'd have to build to
[00:07:42] reproduce what you're talking about a
[00:07:45] know-how Synergy platform could
[00:07:46] literally be anything it could be a
[00:07:48] collaborative edtech company or it could
[00:07:50] be a Marketplace for experts like you
[00:07:53] literally have no idea what you what
[00:07:54] you'd have to build to reproduce a
[00:07:57] know-how Synergy platform another
[00:07:59] mistake Founders make is rambling they
[00:08:01] just go on and on and on and don't do
[00:08:03] this the person you're talking to will
[00:08:05] have already zoned out so here's the
[00:08:08] actual description Airbnb used on their
[00:08:10] YC application we built the first Online
[00:08:13] Marketplace that lets Travelers book
[00:08:15] room to locals instead of hotels this is
[00:08:18] a tight description it describes the
[00:08:21] problem they're solving and who they're
[00:08:22] solving it for so here's one I pulled
[00:08:25] from the startup School Forum open queue
[00:08:28] find and talk to your target B2B users
[00:08:31] fast again they tell you the problem
[00:08:33] they're solving and who they're solving
[00:08:36] it for they're making it easy for B2B
[00:08:38] companies to reach potential customers
[00:08:40] and you can sort of imagine what you
[00:08:42] might have to build to reproduce what
[00:08:44] they're doing okay here's another one I
[00:08:46] pulled from the startup School Forum yum
[00:08:49] it's a clever name adaptive ml driven
[00:08:51] mental health for your team and I get
[00:08:53] this what this is It's a digital mental
[00:08:56] health tools to help your team cope with
[00:08:58] stress and burnout but I think you can
[00:09:01] Workshop it a little bit if you're
[00:09:03] showing this to potential customers I
[00:09:05] think they'll care less about the fact
[00:09:07] that the product is ml driven and more
[00:09:09] about the fact that it's personalized
[00:09:11] digital therapy so I I changed it up to
[00:09:13] personalized digital therapy programs
[00:09:16] for your team some people ask me whether
[00:09:18] the X for y construction is too cliche
[00:09:21] to use when describing their company and
[00:09:24] let's be honest the term you know Uber
[00:09:27] for x or Airbnb B for X has been a bit
[00:09:29] overused
[00:09:30] I want to emphasize that all of you
[00:09:32] should have a one-line description that
[00:09:34] does not use the X for y construction
[00:09:36] but the X for y construction can be used
[00:09:40] in certain cases so for example paisy
[00:09:43] which is a YC Alum can describe
[00:09:46] themselves as stripe for his former
[00:09:48] Soviet Union countries but they could
[00:09:50] also describe themselves as payment
[00:09:53] processing for former Soviet countries
[00:09:55] but let's talk about when it's okay to
[00:09:58] use the X for y Construction
[00:10:00] going back to paisy if the founders are
[00:10:03] talking to people in Silicon Valley so
[00:10:05] investors or press for example uh then
[00:10:08] it might make sense you might use the X
[00:10:10] for y analogy if it really is the best
[00:10:13] way to paint a picture of what you're
[00:10:15] building very quickly if you go with
[00:10:17] this construction you need three
[00:10:19] ingredients first of all X should be a
[00:10:22] household name
[00:10:24] second it should be reasonably clear why
[00:10:26] y might want X
[00:10:28] and third y should be a huge market so
[00:10:32] one YC company described themselves
[00:10:34] early on as buffer for Snapchat even
[00:10:37] know buffer is doing well as a company
[00:10:39] it's not a company that not everyone
[00:10:41] necessarily knows when I was reading
[00:10:43] this description in their YC application
[00:10:45] I literally had to go to Google and
[00:10:47] Google buffer so in this case you're
[00:10:49] better off describing the problem that
[00:10:52] you're solving so here's an X for y
[00:10:54] example from the startup School
[00:10:55] community that I think works hark alive
[00:10:57] is Airbnb for dance and movement classes
[00:11:00] it paints a fast picture of what Harker
[00:11:03] live is but honestly you could also just
[00:11:05] as easily say harkalive is a Marketplace
[00:11:08] for dance and movement classes so to
[00:11:10] review the best one-liners are
[00:11:12] descriptive they describe what you do
[00:11:14] the problem and who you're solving it
[00:11:16] for
[00:11:17] they're conversational and don't use
[00:11:19] jargon or marketing language and there's
[00:11:21] no long-winded lead up they're concise
[00:11:24] short and sweet so now that you know
[00:11:27] what you need for a good one sentence
[00:11:29] pitch let's talk about why you want to
[00:11:32] launch continuously even before you have
[00:11:34] a fully functioning product
[00:11:36] launching early gives you the chance to
[00:11:39] practice and refine your idea you can a
[00:11:42] B test the idea or messaging on people
[00:11:44] you get an opportunity to see how people
[00:11:47] respond to it and then once you have a
[00:11:50] product launching through different
[00:11:51] channels will give you an opportunity to
[00:11:54] see how people respond to the actual
[00:11:55] product and launching on different
[00:11:57] channels will also help you determine
[00:11:59] whether you're even talking to the right
[00:12:01] users different channels will naturally
[00:12:03] reach different audiences so let's talk
[00:12:06] about some of the types of launches you
[00:12:09] can do in your early stages here are
[00:12:11] different types of launches and I'm
[00:12:12] going to go through each one of these
[00:12:14] briefly so first is the silent launch
[00:12:17] and this is something every one of you
[00:12:19] should do while you're in startup school
[00:12:20] I clicked on 10 random startup School
[00:12:23] companies today and only half of them
[00:12:25] had landing pages so you don't need
[00:12:28] anything fancy at the very least you
[00:12:31] need a domain name your company name a
[00:12:33] short description a way for users to
[00:12:36] contact you and a call to action your
[00:12:38] call to action might be sign up for a
[00:12:40] newsletter or sign up to here when we
[00:12:42] launch here's an example of a startup
[00:12:44] School company landing page Lara they
[00:12:47] have their domain name a company name
[00:12:49] short description and a call to action
[00:12:51] sign up for the wait list and this is
[00:12:54] all you really need the next type of
[00:12:56] launch is to friends and family
[00:12:58] even if you're at idea stage you can
[00:13:00] test out your one to two sentence pitch
[00:13:02] on friends and family and once you have
[00:13:04] an MVP you should do a friends and
[00:13:07] family launch as quickly as possible so
[00:13:10] in its earliest days Reddit was shared
[00:13:13] among the founders of the first YC batch
[00:13:16] I use the Wayback machine to find the
[00:13:18] earliest view of Reddit I can find from
[00:13:20] 2005. so this was even before they
[00:13:23] called upvotes upvotes so share your
[00:13:26] product with friends and family watch
[00:13:28] them use the product and ask them for
[00:13:30] feedback but one thing about the friends
[00:13:32] and family launch don't stay in this
[00:13:34] phase for too long because your friends
[00:13:36] and family might not be the ideal users
[00:13:38] for what you're building and sometimes
[00:13:40] their feedback isn't going to be as
[00:13:42] helpful as a real users next type of
[00:13:45] launch launching to strangers I want to
[00:13:48] share the MVP for doordash this is the
[00:13:50] very first version of the doordash site
[00:13:52] when they first started out the founders
[00:13:54] were building other things they were
[00:13:56] building tech for small business owners
[00:13:58] and so they started approaching store
[00:14:00] owners for feedback and they spent a lot
[00:14:03] of time talking to this one store
[00:14:05] manager Chloe she was the manager of a
[00:14:07] macaron store in Downtown Palo Alto in
[00:14:10] talking to Chloe they realized that the
[00:14:11] app they were building really didn't
[00:14:13] solve any of her problems but just as
[00:14:15] they were about to leave Chloe always
[00:14:16] said hey there's just one thing I want
[00:14:18] to show you and it was this thick
[00:14:20] booklet with pages and pages of pages of
[00:14:23] delivery orders
[00:14:24] she said this drives me crazy I have no
[00:14:26] drivers to fulfill them and I'm the one
[00:14:28] doing all the deliveries over the course
[00:14:30] of the next few weeks the founders
[00:14:32] interviewed over 200 small business
[00:14:35] owners across the bay area and they kept
[00:14:37] hearing the same issue deliveries are
[00:14:40] painful
[00:14:41] then after they you know absorbed enough
[00:14:44] information about the product they built
[00:14:46] this their MVP in just a few hours
[00:14:50] so if they'd waited too long to get
[00:14:53] direct feedback from their customers
[00:14:54] they might have spent way longer you
[00:14:56] know six months plus building out the
[00:14:59] wrong solution for small business owners
[00:15:01] so I'd recommend you get out there even
[00:15:03] if it makes you slightly uncomfortable
[00:15:04] and start talking to your potential
[00:15:06] customers as soon as possible do what
[00:15:08] doordash did and talk to 200. so next is
[00:15:11] one of my favorite ways to launch
[00:15:13] through online communities so I think
[00:15:16] you should plan a launch for every
[00:15:17] single community that you are part of
[00:15:19] when a company goes through YC for
[00:15:21] example they have the option of
[00:15:23] launching on Bookface before they launch
[00:15:25] publicly Bookface is our internal
[00:15:27] platform for Founders it's like Facebook
[00:15:29] meets LinkedIn meets quora all for YC
[00:15:32] Founders and there are currently over 6
[00:15:35] 000 Founders on bookbase so for many
[00:15:37] companies in YC it's a good way to get
[00:15:39] some first users and some early feedback
[00:15:42] and it's a fairly low risk way to launch
[00:15:44] because you're launching in front of a
[00:15:46] friendly community of other Founders
[00:15:47] there are countless examples of
[00:15:49] companies that have launched and gotten
[00:15:51] their first or first thousand customers
[00:15:53] through online communities another
[00:15:55] community that you have access to is
[00:15:57] Hacker News they have something called
[00:15:59] show hn so many YC alumni Dropbox and
[00:16:03] git lab for example and hundreds more
[00:16:05] have launched on Hacker News Robin Hood
[00:16:08] is an example of another company that
[00:16:10] successfully launched on hn so back in
[00:16:13] December 2013 they had a really simple
[00:16:15] site and all it said was commission free
[00:16:18] trading stop paying up to ten dollars
[00:16:20] per trade
[00:16:21] at the time they only had a button that
[00:16:24] let you join a waitlist the waitlist
[00:16:26] would show you how many people were
[00:16:28] ahead of you in line and how many people
[00:16:29] were behind you in line
[00:16:31] so it was a Friday night and they'd been
[00:16:33] working on building this wait list in
[00:16:35] preparation for a launch they were
[00:16:37] planning the following week with someone
[00:16:39] totally random posted them on hn and
[00:16:41] boom they got to number one on hn and
[00:16:44] ended up getting 10 000 signups the
[00:16:46] first day and then over 50 000 over the
[00:16:49] next week so each Community is different
[00:16:52] they have different tones audiences
[00:16:54] interests launched communities you're
[00:16:57] genuinely genuinely engaged with so be
[00:17:00] authentic don't get bogged down and too
[00:17:03] much marketing and promo language people
[00:17:06] these days just shut off when they see
[00:17:08] that do your research and get an
[00:17:10] understanding of what will compel
[00:17:12] members of that Community to be
[00:17:13] interested in what you're doing so we
[00:17:15] don't have time to do a huge Deep dive
[00:17:18] into these next types of launches but I
[00:17:20] wanted to skim them briefly and share
[00:17:23] some resources and things that I found
[00:17:24] recently so in a q a we did with the
[00:17:27] replit founders a few weeks ago you
[00:17:29] asked amjad and Haya how did you get
[00:17:31] your first users and they said you just
[00:17:34] have to be everywhere Hacker News
[00:17:36] Twitter Reddit Etc so I wanted to share
[00:17:40] a thread that YC Alum Catherine cross
[00:17:42] tweeted out about building her community
[00:17:44] on Tick Tock Anja Health Catherine's
[00:17:46] company helps parents freeze their
[00:17:48] babies umbilical cords and placentas for
[00:17:50] there's some stuff for their stem cells
[00:17:52] so she wrote This Thread about how she
[00:17:55] committed to posting tick tocks to start
[00:17:57] building a community in advance of the
[00:17:59] company's launch and in just a month she
[00:18:02] hit 10 000 followers so she shared this
[00:18:04] thread on tips for building a community
[00:18:07] on Tick Tock which uh we will link to in
[00:18:10] the chat there is of course the
[00:18:12] pre-order launch and if you are a
[00:18:15] hardware or product or physical product
[00:18:17] you can do a pre-order campaign on a
[00:18:19] platform like Kickstarter or Indiegogo
[00:18:22] so preparing uh for a pre-order launch
[00:18:25] could honestly be a whole presentation
[00:18:27] of its own and honestly there's a little
[00:18:30] bit more skepticism about crowdfunding
[00:18:32] and pre-orders than there was say five
[00:18:34] years ago so it's worth thinking about
[00:18:36] whether it's the right thing for your
[00:18:38] company but YC Alum ship Bob wrote a
[00:18:42] guide on pre-orders that talks about why
[00:18:44] you should or should not consider doing
[00:18:46] this type of campaign there are a lot of
[00:18:48] great you know sort of guides that walk
[00:18:50] you through uh pre-order campaigns and
[00:18:52] how to prepare for them online as well
[00:18:53] all right and then there's the waitlist
[00:18:55] launch we talked about a really good
[00:18:57] example of that with Robin Hood earlier
[00:18:59] and there are other examples like
[00:19:01] superhuman uh that launch successfully
[00:19:03] with a wait list one note on the
[00:19:06] waitlist launch the longer you wait to
[00:19:08] launch an actual product and the longer
[00:19:11] you wait to onboard people the harder it
[00:19:14] is to convert people from your waitlist
[00:19:16] so please don't sit on your waitlist for
[00:19:19] too long okay so why are we not going to
[00:19:23] talk about press it all in this talk
[00:19:25] these days if you were an early stage
[00:19:27] company that hasn't raised you know say
[00:19:29] a million or more it's going to be
[00:19:32] incredibly hard to land press stories at
[00:19:34] least in the U.S but that said even if
[00:19:37] you do land press it's not a silver
[00:19:39] bullet it's not a scalable way to get
[00:19:42] users it might help you get in front of
[00:19:44] some early users and investors but as
[00:19:46] you see press can't be counted on for
[00:19:49] sustained growth it will not get you to
[00:19:52] product Market fit so don't spend a ton
[00:19:55] of your time during startup School
[00:19:56] worrying about getting press what I do
[00:19:58] want to emphasize is while you're in
[00:20:01] startup school you should start to build
[00:20:03] your own Community it can be as simple
[00:20:06] as starting an email list of your
[00:20:07] supporters and figuring out you know how
[00:20:10] to engage them on an ongoing basis and
[00:20:13] you may be surprised who reads the email
[00:20:15] and shows up to help and in the future
[00:20:16] every time you release a new product or
[00:20:19] a new feature you can use all these
[00:20:22] channels to launch on them again
[00:20:24] stripe has always been great at engaging
[00:20:27] with the community each time a new
[00:20:29] product launches they blog about it
[00:20:32] they've the founders get on Hacker News
[00:20:34] and they talk to the hn community they
[00:20:36] spread the word on social media they
[00:20:38] pitch press
[00:20:39] stripe they are Masters at launching
[00:20:42] again and again so to sum up I want you
[00:20:45] to stop thinking about launching as just
[00:20:48] one moment in time if you launch and no
[00:20:51] one pays attention do what Airbnb did
[00:20:54] and launch again and again
