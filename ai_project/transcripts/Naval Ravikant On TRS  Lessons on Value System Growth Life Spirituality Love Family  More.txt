Transcript:

[00:00:00] this was one of the biggest days of my
[00:00:01] podcasting career that's the magic of
[00:00:02] naal ravikant Nal rant Nal ravikant
[00:00:06] founder of Angel Del no rikan Naro rakan
[00:00:10] the founder of angelist which is a giant
[00:00:12] business I mean Global I I wonder if
[00:00:14] you've ever thought of that reality if
[00:00:16] your parents didn't leave India and go
[00:00:18] to the US how would your life be
[00:00:19] different according to you the first
[00:00:20] time I used an Apple computer it was an
[00:00:22] old Macintosh I just fell in love with
[00:00:25] it at some point if you have high agency
[00:00:27] you will end up where you're meant to go
[00:00:29] it's just going to take some effort did
[00:00:30] it do anything for your mind I kind of
[00:00:32] sometimes have these near-death
[00:00:33] exercises where it's just like I imagine
[00:00:35] myself dying it's like you can see
[00:00:36] things fading out they call orgasm the
[00:00:38] petite more The Little Death right did
[00:00:40] you ever smoke weed you know I live in
[00:00:43] California well the common belief now is
[00:00:45] that like mushrooms are harmless right
[00:00:46] they're
[00:00:48] not do you miss your childhood I don't
[00:00:51] have a it's like a dream is it real
[00:00:54] actually
[00:00:55] happened B has had a great saying in
[00:00:57] every human there is a sense that
[00:01:00] something infinite has been lost wow has
[00:01:03] marriage brought further understanding
[00:01:05] when it comes to life there's a secret
[00:01:07] to a happy relationship is to happy
[00:01:09] people you know what I've learned about
[00:01:11] marriage one's wife is always right and
[00:01:14] that's the rule one should follow yes I
[00:01:15] reject that completely uh yeah people
[00:01:17] say like happy wife happy life that's
[00:01:19] all propaganda that's all feminine
[00:01:21] propaganda you're being brainwashed no
[00:01:24] both people have to be equally happy
[00:01:26] really you know from the outside looking
[00:01:29] in I personally have this impression of
[00:01:32] Naval rikan the brand and the human and
[00:01:34] I feel like nothing hurts that guy I'm a
[00:01:36] very paranoid person so my rule is I
[00:01:39] don't fight with people if somebody
[00:01:40] wants to fight with me we get one fight
[00:01:42] and then it's over there's a lot of
[00:01:44] people out there and life is long do you
[00:01:45] pray if you are older in life and you
[00:01:48] don't have the Next Generation to look
[00:01:50] forward to then you better find God fast
[00:01:54] because I don't think like your own mind
[00:01:55] and your own life will be kind to you as
[00:01:57] you get older
[00:02:03] if you know who Naval ravikant is please
[00:02:04] head straight into the conversation this
[00:02:06] intro is primarily crafted for those of
[00:02:09] you who are being introduced to Naval
[00:02:10] ravikant for the first time surprisingly
[00:02:13] there's a lot of people in India who are
[00:02:16] yet to be introduced to who I consider
[00:02:18] to be the greatest philosopher of our
[00:02:21] times I genuinely believe that history
[00:02:23] will remember him as one of the greatest
[00:02:26] Minds that lived in the 21st century
[00:02:30] he's an extremely humble extremely
[00:02:33] relaxed individual so I know that this
[00:02:35] intro is going to bother him on some
[00:02:37] level that's the side of Naval that I
[00:02:40] got to know through this conversation
[00:02:42] this is the most casual conversation
[00:02:45] that the internet has ever seen with
[00:02:47] this man it was one of the biggest
[00:02:50] honors of my own podcasting career to be
[00:02:52] sharing screen space and podcasting
[00:02:54] space with Naval ravikant if I had to
[00:02:56] introduce him professionally of course
[00:02:57] I'd tell you how he's one of the most
[00:02:59] iconic Angel Investors in the world of
[00:03:01] course i' tell you about how he's one of
[00:03:04] the most important thought leaders for
[00:03:06] Silicon Valley and the world of Global
[00:03:09] Twitter or X it's Naval ravikant on the
[00:03:12] RV show this is one of the most
[00:03:14] memorable episodes for me on a personal
[00:03:16] level but if you're looking for depth in
[00:03:19] conversation it doesn't get deeper than
[00:03:21] Naval rikan's mind it's Naval on
[00:03:24] TRS huge day for my career honestly huge
[00:03:28] day for my own Human Experience
[00:03:30] enjoy the
[00:03:32] [Music]
[00:03:47] episode this is one of the biggest days
[00:03:50] of my podcasting career but I'm also
[00:03:52] feeling supremely comfortable that's the
[00:03:54] magic of Nel ravian oh you're very nice
[00:03:56] welcome to the ren show sir thank you
[00:03:57] thanks for having me uh visualize this
[00:04:00] moment so much over the years so as I
[00:04:02] told you in the car ride on the way here
[00:04:04] uh I'm full of gratitude and as we go
[00:04:07] forward in this conversation I'm going
[00:04:08] to pour more and more gratitude on you
[00:04:10] uh when we were on our way here from the
[00:04:12] network state conference I saw how much
[00:04:13] you were hounded uh people just want to
[00:04:16] come up and say that they love you uh
[00:04:18] this takes me back to that Joe Rogan
[00:04:20] episode you did in 2019 are you aware of
[00:04:23] how many young men's lives that episode
[00:04:26] affected I have no idea why to be honest
[00:04:29] I feel like I just said the same things
[00:04:31] I was saying they're kind of obvious and
[00:04:34] maybe uh don't be so easily influenced
[00:04:37] really yeah think for yourself you know
[00:04:39] decide for yourself you know how I look
[00:04:41] at it so in 2019 I was 26 running four
[00:04:44] businesses parall getting extremely
[00:04:46] stressed out but those two hours of that
[00:04:48] episode created switches in me and my
[00:04:50] journey from age 26 to age 31 has been
[00:04:54] much more lubricated especially from a
[00:04:56] mental health perspective so you've done
[00:04:58] a lot for the mental health of many men
[00:05:00] all over the world how how much do we
[00:05:02] really figure out ourselves right
[00:05:03] there's like there there's what are the
[00:05:06] different kinds of knowledge this weth
[00:05:07] thinking through right I'm just thinking
[00:05:08] it through with you so there's Knowledge
[00:05:10] from direct experience right you
[00:05:12] experience something and that generates
[00:05:15] knowledge inside of you there's
[00:05:17] knowledge that you pick up from other
[00:05:19] sources you just a vessel that's passing
[00:05:21] through you you picked it up you
[00:05:22] synthesize it you
[00:05:23] regurgitate there's uh knowledge that
[00:05:27] you create which is rare um um I don't
[00:05:30] know if I said anything original really
[00:05:33] yeah I don't know I don't know but I
[00:05:35] think you accumulated a lot of data
[00:05:37] which is back by years of reading and
[00:05:39] research I think if I were to look back
[00:05:43] I would say that the only true knowledge
[00:05:45] I have is the knowledge that is uh
[00:05:50] directly verified by me and uh fits in
[00:05:54] with the other pieces so I view myself
[00:05:57] as a very basic thinker really yeah I
[00:06:00] don't view myself as an advanced thinker
[00:06:02] I'm not an expert in anything but what I
[00:06:04] like to do is everything that comes my
[00:06:06] way I like to deeply understand it as
[00:06:08] simply as possible I have to be able to
[00:06:10] put it in simple words and simple
[00:06:12] Frameworks and simple Concepts and I
[00:06:15] have to be able to do it uh almost
[00:06:18] visually in my mind and exponentially
[00:06:21] have to map it to some experience that I
[00:06:22] have and then I have to be able to take
[00:06:24] that and I have to be able to plug it
[00:06:26] into something else I understand it has
[00:06:27] to fit in a steel frame of understanding
[00:06:30] at the basics of knowledge uh so for
[00:06:33] example mathematics I was never very
[00:06:34] good at mathematics I wanted to be a
[00:06:36] physicist but I I wasn't good at
[00:06:37] calculus but my basic math is really
[00:06:39] really good um the same way I don't have
[00:06:42] the largest vocabulary but I have a very
[00:06:44] solid vocabulary and I can be very
[00:06:46] precise with my words even when I speak
[00:06:48] I'm not the fastest speaker I'm not the
[00:06:50] slowest speaker so I think for me it's
[00:06:53] just about I don't take there's a great
[00:06:55] uh motto from the Royal Society which
[00:06:58] was the Society of scientists in uh
[00:07:01] Britain during their Enlightenment era
[00:07:03] and uh the motto of the royal so Society
[00:07:05] is nullus and verba I'm sorry if I'm
[00:07:07] mangling the Latin but it means take no
[00:07:09] one's word for it and I love that uh
[00:07:12] take no one's word for it so I think uh
[00:07:16] we are encouraged these days to take in
[00:07:19] knowledge pour it into our heads like a
[00:07:20] bucket and uh we regurgitate it and we
[00:07:24] use fancy words to cover up what we
[00:07:25] don't mean what we don't know and I
[00:07:28] don't accept that unless I understand
[00:07:30] something at its core fundamental level
[00:07:33] I don't understand it and then beyond
[00:07:34] that level I get bored I don't care to
[00:07:36] understand it so I think just being able
[00:07:39] to be very particular about what you
[00:07:42] take in make sure you truly understand
[00:07:45] it and that it is true truth is the most
[00:07:47] important thing because if you're going
[00:07:49] ahead with falsehoods because they're
[00:07:51] convenient you're just going to walk
[00:07:52] around bumping your head against reality
[00:07:53] and wondering why it hurts so it's
[00:07:55] important to just always look for the
[00:07:57] truth figure it out for yourself make
[00:08:00] sure it fits into your understanding be
[00:08:02] open to revising it because you're
[00:08:03] always wrong it's just question of how
[00:08:05] wrong you are uh and then using that to
[00:08:09] uh find the commonalities in life and
[00:08:10] and navigate it and I think that's why
[00:08:13] uh you're better off asking someone like
[00:08:17] me about very basic things uh than about
[00:08:20] very Advanced things can I ask you a
[00:08:23] basic question sure yeah please what's
[00:08:25] the meaning of
[00:08:26] life we talk about this for hours I
[00:08:28] think about it all the time I think
[00:08:29] about it I I want to kind of reframe it
[00:08:32] a little bit sure yeah uh what's new
[00:08:34] right now in life for you it's been 5
[00:08:37] years since that Joe Rogan episode and
[00:08:38] we got to know you so deeply then yeah
[00:08:40] but what's happened in the last five
[00:08:42] years I don't I don't I don't uh
[00:08:43] retrospect on myself I don't think about
[00:08:45] myself that's what's new no no I just
[00:08:48] don't I I couldn't tell you because I
[00:08:49] don't think about myself I don't think
[00:08:51] about what's changed in my life and if
[00:08:52] my life is good or bad or if this
[00:08:54] happened or that happened and I don't
[00:08:55] look at all photos of me and I don't
[00:08:57] think about old trips and I think about
[00:08:59] people that are gone you know I don't I
[00:09:01] don't think about the past I just don't
[00:09:02] live in the past at all do you pray uh
[00:09:06] not in the traditional sense no uh I
[00:09:08] think prayer implies some kind of an
[00:09:10] external entity that I'm asking
[00:09:12] something for and sure like every person
[00:09:14] I might have done that here or there um
[00:09:16] usually we're fair weather friends with
[00:09:18] any God that's out there right when we
[00:09:19] need help we're like all prayer and when
[00:09:21] we don't we're like everything's good
[00:09:22] it's all me right so no I don't I don't
[00:09:24] pray in the traditional sense
[00:09:27] uh but I am very deeply I hate the word
[00:09:30] but it's spiritual right and I would
[00:09:32] Define spiritual in a negative way it
[00:09:34] just means not mental not physical right
[00:09:36] so but why do you hate the
[00:09:38] words because it's overloaded with a lot
[00:09:40] of religiosity um all of a sudden you're
[00:09:43] supposed to be a spiritual being you're
[00:09:44] supposed to do yoga you're supposed to
[00:09:46] meditate and you're supposed to sit
[00:09:47] cross- lugged and you're supposed to you
[00:09:48] know then you argue about is the bagat
[00:09:50] Gita or the asash Gita or the you know
[00:09:53] all of these roads lead to the same
[00:09:55] place um the the the best way I would SU
[00:09:59] Ariz my thinking on this is that I think
[00:10:01] existence itself is a miracle the oldest
[00:10:04] questions are why is there something
[00:10:06] instead of nothing why are we here
[00:10:07] what's the meaning of life these are all
[00:10:08] just variants in the same question and
[00:10:12] there is no answer to that does that
[00:10:14] mean there can never be an answer to
[00:10:15] that no not necessarily but if you start
[00:10:17] going down that road you'll find all
[00:10:19] kinds of contradictions for example with
[00:10:21] just the meaning of life right if there
[00:10:22] was a single meaning of life then we
[00:10:24] would all be slaves to it suppose the
[00:10:26] meaning of life was to help others and
[00:10:27] we would all be running around trying to
[00:10:28] help others and you know there'd be no
[00:10:29] room for the individual if the meaning
[00:10:31] of life was to you know be strong and
[00:10:33] fit and healthy then we'd all be working
[00:10:35] out um we'd all be I don't know how beer
[00:10:38] and biceps go together but you know we'd
[00:10:39] all be building our biceps so it's
[00:10:43] better that there is no overarching
[00:10:44] singular meaning of life it's better
[00:10:46] that there are personal interpretations
[00:10:48] got um however within those personal
[00:10:50] interpretations you know we we all have
[00:10:53] even though we have complete freedom to
[00:10:54] choose any meaning that we want and we
[00:10:56] can create our own meaning at any moment
[00:10:59] um
[00:11:00] there are certain common things in what
[00:11:01] we all want as well and so that's kind
[00:11:03] of the Paradox of being a human
[00:11:06] individual where you're completely an
[00:11:07] individual but you're also completely
[00:11:09] Interlink to everything and anything
[00:11:11] that exists you couldn't change you
[00:11:13] couldn't change a particle in the
[00:11:15] universe without changing this moment
[00:11:17] right not in any meaningful way um
[00:11:20] although that's not entirely true there
[00:11:22] are error correcting mechanisms built
[00:11:23] into into the structure of the universe
[00:11:25] so uh but a lot of things had to cons in
[00:11:29] a very particular way to bring us here
[00:11:31] together today right um so in that sense
[00:11:35] everything is very interconnected on the
[00:11:37] other
[00:11:38] hand my life is and your lives are
[00:11:40] single player games inside our heads you
[00:11:42] know we interpret everything from birth
[00:11:44] to death uh your experience of uh your
[00:11:47] experiences are singular to you uh no
[00:11:49] one will truly ever understand you or
[00:11:51] get you uh and you're always searching
[00:11:54] for that Unity that connection that that
[00:11:56] going back to uh you know Oneness Source
[00:12:00] togetherness whatever you want to call
[00:12:01] it Community there's many words for
[00:12:03] it in terms of uh you know back to
[00:12:06] meaning of life the way I think of it is
[00:12:08] that existence itself is a miracle and
[00:12:10] everything else is science and I think
[00:12:12] that's the best of all possible worlds
[00:12:14] so spirituality is a side that lies on
[00:12:17] what who am I why am I here how long
[00:12:20] have I got what am I here for and these
[00:12:22] are questions that are really only
[00:12:24] answerable at a personal level this
[00:12:26] miraculous little world that we're in is
[00:12:29] beautifully put together I couldn't I
[00:12:31] couldn't do a better job for sure for
[00:12:33] sure I couldn't even begin to do the job
[00:12:35] and just to give you some ideas as to
[00:12:37] you know just some observations how well
[00:12:39] it's put together the fact that science
[00:12:41] works that's magic technology works that
[00:12:44] is Magic you go back and you read books
[00:12:46] on magic or magicians or fantasy books
[00:12:48] they don't have a hundred of the power
[00:12:49] that we have they don't have
[00:12:50] self-driving cars they don't have
[00:12:52] smartphones they don't have antibiotics
[00:12:53] they don't have Rockets um they don't
[00:12:55] even have fantasy novels they don't even
[00:12:57] have clean running water they don't have
[00:12:59] reliable food they don't have food
[00:13:01] delivery services right uh so we are
[00:13:04] already living in an age of Miracles
[00:13:06] that the best part is we can control and
[00:13:08] the magic spells that we cast are under
[00:13:10] the opice of science the Wizardry that
[00:13:12] we create is through technology and
[00:13:15] that's all manipulable through laws and
[00:13:17] and rules and systems that we discover
[00:13:19] and we discover and we create and that
[00:13:22] is incredible we're all magicians I
[00:13:24] wouldn't I couldn't ask for a better
[00:13:25] system if an actual Miracle showed up
[00:13:28] afterwards supposed somebody showed up
[00:13:30] and turned uh loaves into fish or water
[00:13:33] into wine that would destroy our world
[00:13:35] because all of a sudden you be like oh
[00:13:36] my God there's all these rules for this
[00:13:38] new thing that we don't understand how
[00:13:39] it works so now science is junk and you
[00:13:41] wouldn't know how to navigate the world
[00:13:42] and now You' be the mercy of demons and
[00:13:44] angels and spirits and you'd be running
[00:13:45] around worshiping and praying then you
[00:13:46] would pray because you'd be like how do
[00:13:48] I make sense of this world so I think we
[00:13:50] live in the best of all possible worlds
[00:13:52] okay uh I think the geography that one
[00:13:54] grows up in definitely determines their
[00:13:57] mindset in life to a large degree
[00:13:59] and uh personally my take on
[00:14:01] spirituality is affected by growing up
[00:14:05] in India you read books like the
[00:14:07] autobiography of your Yogi you read the
[00:14:09] life of the Buddha uh I definitely feel
[00:14:12] that there's a higher stage of
[00:14:13] Consciousness and I don't feel like
[00:14:14] we've reach the final state of evolution
[00:14:17] uh there is definitely an end point
[00:14:19] which is also beyond the next stage of
[00:14:20] evolution uh and I do believe that you
[00:14:23] know you say that Cal a calm mind is
[00:14:24] earned MH I think that's one of the
[00:14:27] steps on the ladder and then there's
[00:14:28] like higher stage
[00:14:29] mhm I I don't know how useful it is to
[00:14:32] prognosticate about where humanity is
[00:14:34] headed unless you get there yourself
[00:14:37] first uh and and you don't have the
[00:14:40] ability to do anything for anyone unless
[00:14:43] you embody it yourself uh so so to the
[00:14:46] extent that you think humanity is headed
[00:14:47] there I say get there first and then
[00:14:49] show them the way I definitely think
[00:14:52] that Nal rant is already on that ladder
[00:14:54] as compared to other human beings I have
[00:14:56] no idea where I'm on that ladder you
[00:14:58] don't think you're slightly more
[00:14:59] evolved no I I
[00:15:02] don't that's a loaded question
[00:15:06] uh first of all I don't think of myself
[00:15:09] I I just want to be clear on that and
[00:15:10] that's not a rule it's just a habit I've
[00:15:12] kind of developed because I found that
[00:15:14] thinking about yourself is a source of
[00:15:16] all unhappiness and misery really yes
[00:15:18] self-obsession is the root of all
[00:15:20] unhappiness what did Buddha do conquer
[00:15:22] the self what does that mean means that
[00:15:24] he saw through the illusion of the
[00:15:25] separate self what does that did Buddha
[00:15:27] think about himself not for an instant
[00:15:29] you know anyone that you think of as an
[00:15:31] enlightened being does not think about
[00:15:32] themselves for an instant the happiest
[00:15:34] people in life when people are their
[00:15:36] best is because uh they love something
[00:15:38] more than they love themselves they love
[00:15:39] their children they love God they love
[00:15:41] their mission what have you and all
[00:15:43] misery comes from rumination from
[00:15:44] sitting around being depressed going in
[00:15:46] circles in your own head about me me me
[00:15:48] me is a disease and uh you need the a
[00:15:52] concept of a me to be effective and to
[00:15:56] keep track of things you have a memory
[00:15:57] you have certain predictions your
[00:15:59] personality patterns but the more you
[00:16:00] self- obsessed the less happy you're
[00:16:02] going to be I guarantee you that and I'm
[00:16:03] not doing I'm not saying I don't think
[00:16:05] about myself to be happy I can't even
[00:16:07] tell you why I don't think about myself
[00:16:08] I think it just comes from having
[00:16:09] thought through a lot of things and then
[00:16:11] just I I get interested in topics and
[00:16:14] Concepts and ideas and understandings
[00:16:16] and the more that I sort of focus that
[00:16:19] way the less I just end up thinking
[00:16:21] about myself so even like you know
[00:16:23] people ask me like oh how's your day
[00:16:24] going I'm like I have no idea I don't
[00:16:26] think about it really yeah good maybe if
[00:16:29] I'm really tired I'll say okay I'm tired
[00:16:31] you know if something really bad
[00:16:32] happened like oh it wasn't a great day
[00:16:34] but most of the time I couldn't even
[00:16:35] tell you my own State of Mind okay cuz
[00:16:37] I'm not interested in it I don't think
[00:16:40] it's interesting it's interesting for us
[00:16:42] and I'll give you some perspective here
[00:16:44] yeah we were one of the first podcasts
[00:16:46] in India uh currently the biggest and I
[00:16:50] feel that's an outcome of constantly
[00:16:51] tearing apart people's chest getting
[00:16:53] into their hearts and getting to know
[00:16:55] them because in India we're emotional
[00:16:57] people and we want to know the emotions
[00:16:59] of others we want to know what's in
[00:17:00] other people's mind or it's dumb luck
[00:17:01] cuz you started early I'm just kidding
[00:17:04] or or that of course not I'm just joking
[00:17:06] with you luck is definitely a part of me
[00:17:08] I mean look luck favors are prepared uh
[00:17:11] Joe Rogan uh is incredibly successful
[00:17:13] because he was doing podcasting before
[00:17:16] his podcasting he was the top guy on
[00:17:18] Ustream which was just like a streaming
[00:17:19] thing on the internet before podcasting
[00:17:21] came along so uh there's a certain kind
[00:17:24] of person that it takes to be
[00:17:25] early you make your own luck in that
[00:17:27] sense I actually
[00:17:29] luck is luck is one of those things that
[00:17:31] you shouldn't believe in even if it's
[00:17:33] true because believing it will hurt your
[00:17:35] agency just like victim mentality right
[00:17:37] thinking you're a victim even if it's
[00:17:39] true don't believe it because it'll just
[00:17:40] hurt your agency because you have no
[00:17:42] power as a victim you have no power if
[00:17:43] things are up to luck uh whatever power
[00:17:46] you have in life comes from believing
[00:17:48] that you can change things and do things
[00:17:50] and even if you can't change the outside
[00:17:51] you can at least change the inside No
[00:17:53] One controls your mind but you um so
[00:17:57] yeah it's it's not luck I was jok
[00:17:59] talking the question I have for you is
[00:18:02] while all of us sit in India and view
[00:18:04] Naval ravikant ruling the internet in so
[00:18:08] many ways uh a lot of Indians feel very
[00:18:10] proud okay to see someone from India uh
[00:18:14] you know who shares genetics with us uh
[00:18:17] kind of kill it on a world stage uh so
[00:18:20] I've had this thought experiment lately
[00:18:22] as I've been researching for this
[00:18:23] episode I thought to myself that what if
[00:18:25] Noel's parents didn't leave India and
[00:18:28] what if he was in Delhi I'm pretty sure
[00:18:30] you'd still uh take up some form of
[00:18:32] Entrepreneurship knowing your
[00:18:33] personality because I think there's some
[00:18:34] traits that don't change uh but then
[00:18:37] there's a lot that changes because of
[00:18:38] geography I I wonder if you've ever
[00:18:41] thought of that reality if your parents
[00:18:42] didn't leave India uh and go to the US
[00:18:45] how would your life be different
[00:18:47] according to you I don't I don't want to
[00:18:48] downplay geography at all I actually
[00:18:50] think where you live is the single most
[00:18:52] important decision you make uh but the
[00:18:54] first part of that is making a decision
[00:18:56] uh I like to think that even if my
[00:18:59] parents had not immigrated to the US I
[00:19:01] would have probably done so at a later
[00:19:02] age because I was ambitious uh and I
[00:19:05] wanted to be around smart people and I
[00:19:07] wanted to build things uh when I
[00:19:08] immigrated to the US I was not in any
[00:19:10] position to go to Silicon Valley and
[00:19:11] build things I had to kind of you know
[00:19:13] claw my way there um and I got there a
[00:19:15] little later than I should have frankly
[00:19:17] but at any given time in the world's
[00:19:19] history there's usually only one or two
[00:19:21] places that really matter in terms of
[00:19:23] moving the world forward so there was a
[00:19:25] time when it was Athens in ancient
[00:19:27] Greece there's a time when it was
[00:19:28] Florence in Italy there's a time when it
[00:19:30] was uh London in the United Kingdom and
[00:19:34] the the time when I was kind of coming
[00:19:36] into my formative years it was Silicon
[00:19:38] Valley and I knew that I the first time
[00:19:40] I used an Apple computer it was an old
[00:19:42] Macintosh in uh the computer room in my
[00:19:45] high school I just fell in love with it
[00:19:47] and I and I just knew that I had to get
[00:19:49] closer to uh Apple that that was the
[00:19:52] thing that pulled me in when I got to
[00:19:53] Silicon Valley the first thing I did was
[00:19:55] with my bags I went in a taxi straight
[00:19:57] from the airport to app's headquarters
[00:19:59] and I wandered around um and I'd read
[00:20:01] this book by Guy Kawasaki called the
[00:20:03] Macintosh way that was very
[00:20:04] inspirational to me so at some point if
[00:20:07] you are if you have high agency if
[00:20:09] you're a person that's selfmotivated
[00:20:11] which I think almost everybody watching
[00:20:13] this is um you will end up where you're
[00:20:16] meant to go it's just going to take some
[00:20:18] effort the universe drops plenty of
[00:20:20] opportunity around you but it's not
[00:20:22] necessarily on your head and you have to
[00:20:24] walk over there and pick it up your
[00:20:26] podcast didn't build itself for example
[00:20:29] counterfactuals are impossible to do
[00:20:30] like uh yes if you had gone if you had
[00:20:33] immigrated to the US early you'd
[00:20:35] probably be doing a podcast in the US um
[00:20:37] or uh you know if you weren't born a
[00:20:40] podcaster you found your way to being a
[00:20:42] podcaster so even though yes there's
[00:20:44] luck involved there's counterfactuals
[00:20:46] involved there's immigration involved
[00:20:48] don't believe that stuff you know it's
[00:20:50] better to uh just kind of take
[00:20:53] responsibility both externally and
[00:20:55] internally externally for what you manag
[00:20:57] to do and internally for how you feel
[00:21:00] about it uh like one of my little tweets
[00:21:03] to myself and all the good ones are to
[00:21:05] myself was I and I alone am responsible
[00:21:07] for everything I think and feel um so
[00:21:10] for example if I get mad at somebody
[00:21:12] about something it's my fault why am I
[00:21:14] mad why am I making myself angry um why
[00:21:17] can't I just deal with the same
[00:21:19] situation in a cool calm and collected
[00:21:20] way why do I have to show to or not even
[00:21:23] show why do I have to lose control
[00:21:25] because anger is a loss of self-control
[00:21:27] why why am I still so broken inside that
[00:21:29] that happens so I I kind of reject this
[00:21:33] line of questioning to be honest you
[00:21:35] know what if what if what if who cares
[00:21:37] what if we're here um you know you
[00:21:39] constantly talk about that steel
[00:21:40] framework thing you say that learn the
[00:21:42] first principles yes um while we were at
[00:21:45] the event a lot of the people backstage
[00:21:47] were like ask navel about how he
[00:21:50] achieved this level of clarity and I
[00:21:52] understand that you focus on first
[00:21:53] principles thinking but what's
[00:21:55] underneath that thought like did you
[00:21:57] read a book at some point in life that
[00:21:59] pointed you towards it no no no no no I
[00:22:01] I think uh when I was young my dad
[00:22:04] wasn't around much and uh he was gone he
[00:22:07] had to he immigrated to the US before
[00:22:09] the rest of us did it took four years
[00:22:11] where he could pull us there and then my
[00:22:12] parents went through divorce and so on
[00:22:14] so one good thing was I never had
[00:22:16] anybody telling me what to do ever um
[00:22:18] and I had to figure everything out for
[00:22:20] myself and I think that helps a lot it
[00:22:23] makes you very high agency um I also
[00:22:26] nobody in my like my aunts and my mom
[00:22:28] they loved us to death but there was
[00:22:30] nobody saying this is right that's wrong
[00:22:32] do it this way don't do it that way so
[00:22:34] you figure it out for yourself and
[00:22:35] started with reading but eventually just
[00:22:37] goes to thinking but I don't think
[00:22:39] there's anything special I I think I
[00:22:41] think deep down everybody wants to
[00:22:44] understand things right everybody wants
[00:22:45] to learn everyone's curious all children
[00:22:47] are curious any young child they'll be
[00:22:49] asking questions all day long and I
[00:22:52] think the trick is just don't stop
[00:22:53] asking questions and keep asking
[00:22:55] questions until you can answer something
[00:22:58] your own
[00:22:59] satisfaction um maybe I had the luxury
[00:23:02] of the time to read you know that's
[00:23:05] helpful because it helps answer
[00:23:06] questions when you're younger at least
[00:23:07] some some reading a lot of too much
[00:23:09] reading or reading the wrong things can
[00:23:10] be bad too right because you can stuff
[00:23:12] your head with the wrong things I I I
[00:23:13] guess for for decades I did not feel
[00:23:17] like I was that smart because what would
[00:23:20] happen is I would talk to somebody and
[00:23:23] they'd say well there's this and that
[00:23:24] and there's this and they would just
[00:23:25] start using big terms and big words and
[00:23:27] defining huge things and and it took me
[00:23:29] a long time to figure out they didn't
[00:23:30] know what they were talking about if
[00:23:32] someone's using a lot of big words you
[00:23:34] know it's the mark of a charlatan to
[00:23:36] explain simple things in a complex way
[00:23:39] and uh it's a mark of a Genius Like
[00:23:41] Richard Fineman to to explain
[00:23:42] complicated things in simple ways the
[00:23:44] smartest people actually understand what
[00:23:46] they're talking about so they can
[00:23:48] explain it in plain English they don't
[00:23:49] need to resort to abstractions they
[00:23:51] don't need to impress and a lot of times
[00:23:54] with abstractions are leaky you poke at
[00:23:56] them and it doesn't quite map or it
[00:23:57] doesn't mean what what they think it
[00:23:59] means um I'd rather like stick and I'm a
[00:24:03] failed physicist I wanted to be a
[00:24:04] physicist so and my ma math wasn't good
[00:24:07] enough plus I wanted to make money so it
[00:24:08] didn't work out but uh I was surrounded
[00:24:11] by a lot of physicists and I read a lot
[00:24:13] of physics and so I felt dumb compared
[00:24:15] to the other physicists and so I I well
[00:24:18] I you're not going to trick a physicist
[00:24:19] you're not going to walk in and start
[00:24:21] talking physics and then suddenly like
[00:24:23] you you say something that's wrong
[00:24:24] they're going to call you on it physics
[00:24:26] is very rigorous and same thing with
[00:24:28] computer science which I did end up
[00:24:29] studying is the code has to compile the
[00:24:32] code has to run the code has to work you
[00:24:33] can't you can't trick the machine using
[00:24:35] words and so I think having a grounding
[00:24:38] in scientific disciplines around
[00:24:39] scientific people forces you to be
[00:24:42] rigorous and humble about your actual
[00:24:43] sphere of knowledge uh you can't Bluff
[00:24:46] people um systems in which you get
[00:24:49] feedback like real feedback uh free
[00:24:52] markets and nature right you can't trick
[00:24:54] nature I can't lie to Nature uh and I
[00:24:57] can't trick free markets all end up
[00:24:58] broke so these systems give you very
[00:25:01] good feedback and they force you into
[00:25:02] being rigorous um but it's very easy to
[00:25:05] trick people so if you're in politics if
[00:25:07] you're in law if you're in journalism if
[00:25:08] you're in media uh if you're just you
[00:25:11] know bsing with your friends it's very
[00:25:13] easy to trick people and then you get
[00:25:15] social rewards you don't get the
[00:25:16] negative feedback and that gets baked
[00:25:18] into your personality your identity your
[00:25:20] way of thinking uh so I think I was
[00:25:22] fortunate enough to be
[00:25:24] scientifically uh to get scientific
[00:25:26] feedback and to be pushed back upon
[00:25:29] through science and scientific people um
[00:25:32] also grew up in a tough environment so
[00:25:33] it was a no BS environment you had to be
[00:25:35] correct so you know when you're trying
[00:25:37] to survive you have to be correct uh
[00:25:40] when you have an abundance of resources
[00:25:42] and things are easy you don't have to be
[00:25:43] right because you there's cushions
[00:25:45] everywhere in the environment for you um
[00:25:47] so maybe I was forged that way but like
[00:25:48] I said I don't I don't introspect much I
[00:25:50] don't it doesn't really matter to me
[00:25:51] it's ancient history all that matters is
[00:25:53] here because this is all there is so
[00:25:55] let's talk about the Hein now yeah uh
[00:25:58] you're 50 now yeah has your definition
[00:26:00] of Love changed at all love is just it's
[00:26:05] one of these overloaded words it's like
[00:26:06] Freedom you know it means anything you
[00:26:08] want but what does love mean okay I I
[00:26:10] think so what is love
[00:26:13] okay this romantic love which we're all
[00:26:15] familiar with Bollywood thrives on that
[00:26:18] right that's that's an attachment thing
[00:26:20] it's like I love you if you love me
[00:26:21] let's go have kids together yes this a
[00:26:24] biological programming it's there it's
[00:26:26] important it's good to have that's not
[00:26:27] the real love or you love like a fanboy
[00:26:29] like how all of us love you yeah love
[00:26:31] love is a feeling of unity it's the it's
[00:26:33] the attraction to yourself actually it
[00:26:36] is seeing yourself in something else and
[00:26:38] then kind of wanting to complete with it
[00:26:40] um so you can have a spiritual love
[00:26:42] which is a love for Oneness or God you
[00:26:44] can have a love for your children
[00:26:45] because they're just part of you you can
[00:26:47] have a love for your community because
[00:26:48] it's it's like you you can have love for
[00:26:50] your ideas so love is attraction in that
[00:26:53] sense it's like a it's a positive
[00:26:55] attraction where you you see the unity
[00:26:57] in the thing with you and you don't
[00:26:58] necess want anything out of it and you
[00:27:00] know that's a that's a genuine love um
[00:27:03] the nice thing about love is if you
[00:27:05] think back in your life to when you were
[00:27:07] loved a lot right like you were loved by
[00:27:09] your parents great wonderful to be loved
[00:27:12] by your parents some point you took it
[00:27:13] for granted let's be honest we all take
[00:27:15] our parents for granted that's one of
[00:27:16] the things you learn as a parent
[00:27:17] yourself you're like oh my God my
[00:27:19] parents put up with all of this they
[00:27:20] were Saints right um You you really only
[00:27:24] start valuing your parents when you have
[00:27:25] your own children then you realize what
[00:27:27] a one-way relation relationship that
[00:27:28] love relationship and it's fine that's
[00:27:30] the way it's meant to be even your
[00:27:31] parents they want what's best for you
[00:27:32] they want you to love your kids not to
[00:27:34] love them back at the same level so uh
[00:27:38] one of the things you learn about love
[00:27:39] is okay when you're receiving love you
[00:27:41] take it for granted and it can even be a
[00:27:43] little too much like for example
[00:27:45] someone's attracted to you and you're
[00:27:46] not attracted to them you're like right
[00:27:49] the overzealous fan you know the girl
[00:27:51] the guy who's like chasing you around
[00:27:52] you're like I don't really know I don't
[00:27:54] I'm not really into this so that kind of
[00:27:57] love is the love that we think we want
[00:27:59] but we don't really I mean yes we want a
[00:28:01] little bit of it so we don't feel
[00:28:02] completely alone and and it makes us
[00:28:04] feel safe but it's not really the love
[00:28:06] that you want now think back to when you
[00:28:08] were in love when you're in love with an
[00:28:11] idea how you just work on it
[00:28:12] passionately when you're in love with
[00:28:14] let's say God or spirituality how you're
[00:28:17] just taken and you're you're you're
[00:28:18] swept away or when you're even in love
[00:28:20] with a person you're in love with a
[00:28:22] woman or your love with a man and all of
[00:28:23] a sudden everything is brighter and
[00:28:25] everyone's happier and you're just like
[00:28:26] walking on Cloud9 the feeling of being
[00:28:29] in love is greater than the feeling of
[00:28:31] being loved is my point okay and you can
[00:28:34] be in love anytime you want and how do
[00:28:37] you be in love well you can't be forced
[00:28:41] right you can't buy love you can't force
[00:28:43] love but I will say a commonality is
[00:28:46] generally the less you are thinking
[00:28:47] about yourself going back to what I was
[00:28:49] saying earlier the more you're going to
[00:28:50] be able to love other people and other
[00:28:52] things so for example the Buddhas uh you
[00:28:56] know I you know people will sometimes
[00:28:58] say well that's not a Buddha cuz that
[00:28:59] person is not loving enough well that's
[00:29:00] that's not necessarily true love is not
[00:29:02] a requirement for being a Buddha but it
[00:29:04] is an output of being a Buddha because a
[00:29:06] Buddha is a person who has seen through
[00:29:08] the illusion of the separate self uh and
[00:29:10] once they've seen through the illusion
[00:29:11] of the separate self they're no longer
[00:29:13] self- obsessed and therefore their love
[00:29:16] that was earlier turned inwards and
[00:29:19] became ego love for the self went
[00:29:22] outwards and it still flows uh as a very
[00:29:26] simple example you know here's something
[00:29:28] I uh uh is a little embarrassing but
[00:29:31] I'll be vulnerable you like vulnerable
[00:29:32] vulnerability right so I I I I kind of
[00:29:35] sometimes have these near-death
[00:29:36] exercises right where it's just like I
[00:29:38] imagine myself dying and it's not
[00:29:41] something that I do deliberately just
[00:29:43] kind of happens the the moments when you
[00:29:46] go into bed but before you fall asleep
[00:29:48] are really interesting because your mind
[00:29:49] goes into a really hazy almost
[00:29:51] psychedelic State and and I used to
[00:29:53] meditate a lot and somewhere along the
[00:29:55] way I just found that state between
[00:29:57] sleeping and waking to be really
[00:29:59] entertaining and entertaining
[00:30:00] entertaining yeah it's just entertaining
[00:30:02] so next time you're falling asleep just
[00:30:05] make a just just the smallest effort
[00:30:07] because if you make any real effort
[00:30:08] you'll fall you won't be able to sleep
[00:30:09] but make the smallest effort just to be
[00:30:11] aware of your thoughts as you're falling
[00:30:12] asleep as you're going to sleep and your
[00:30:15] thoughts start going wackier and wackier
[00:30:16] and wackier and they will just get wild
[00:30:18] like I'll have cats talking to me and
[00:30:20] you know just like weird stuff going in
[00:30:22] and out just it's like dreams you're
[00:30:24] you're basically lucid dreaming as
[00:30:25] you're falling asleep and they're the
[00:30:27] craziest dream they don't make any sense
[00:30:29] it's all nonsense You observe your own
[00:30:30] thoughts as you're about to fall asleep
[00:30:32] as I'm about to fall asleep that's when
[00:30:33] that's when your thoughts start going
[00:30:34] off the rails you stop thinking about
[00:30:36] like what am I doing tomorrow and how to
[00:30:38] work go today and you just start having
[00:30:40] these wacky random Connections in your
[00:30:42] head and it can be really fun to watch I
[00:30:44] was doing it just as an entertainment
[00:30:46] thing the an exploratory thing what have
[00:30:48] you found out I'm not looking to find
[00:30:50] anything so I think that's part of
[00:30:52] curiosity you have to be a little
[00:30:53] careful because if you go looking for
[00:30:55] something in particular then you're only
[00:30:56] open to seeing that thing and that's not
[00:30:58] how you find anything that's true um but
[00:31:00] it it's just pure mere curiosity it's
[00:31:02] it's an entertaining State that's that's
[00:31:04] a fine reason to do it right we do
[00:31:06] everything because we enjoy it at the
[00:31:07] end of the day if you didn't you
[00:31:08] wouldn't do it right or you want to not
[00:31:11] NE enjoy it but you do it because you
[00:31:12] want to um so I did it just because I
[00:31:15] wanted to and once in a while once in a
[00:31:18] while and I'm not trying to suggest
[00:31:19] anything because again if I suggest
[00:31:21] something then it's not going to happen
[00:31:23] for you but you know I'll basically feel
[00:31:25] like I'm dying so I'm falling asleep but
[00:31:28] I feel like I'm dying it's like you can
[00:31:29] see things fading out right and as you
[00:31:32] fall asleep the the French uh no that's
[00:31:35] not they call orgasm the petite more The
[00:31:37] Little Death right but uh but it's also
[00:31:40] because your mind shuts down right so
[00:31:42] what's happening is your your mind is
[00:31:43] shutting down from waking to sleeping
[00:31:45] State and that's kind of a death
[00:31:47] transition you can kind of feel like
[00:31:48] you're dying and you can literally see
[00:31:52] thoughts going offline your mind goes
[00:31:54] offline and as your mind goes offline
[00:31:57] pay atten attention to what
[00:31:59] remains pay attention to what actually
[00:32:02] remains and don't be afraid of it don't
[00:32:04] be AF you're just falling asleep but
[00:32:06] like I said sometimes it feels like
[00:32:08] you're dying and don't be afraid of
[00:32:10] death right you just kind of go with it
[00:32:12] it's what's just what's happening and
[00:32:14] then as your mind disappears as things
[00:32:17] disappear as things Fade Out of
[00:32:19] existence see what remains okay there's
[00:32:22] a version of something like this that I
[00:32:24] do for me the last two thoughts are
[00:32:27] always
[00:32:28] the girl I'm seeing and or uh the God I
[00:32:32] know MH which is just Universal energy
[00:32:34] yeah these are all manifestations of
[00:32:36] what you would call love right this is
[00:32:38] this is you stop thinking about yourself
[00:32:40] because thoughts are what Drive the
[00:32:41] self- obsession the self is ultimately
[00:32:43] just a thought it's a it's a the self is
[00:32:45] a thought that I am a separate creature
[00:32:47] I'm a body I'm a mind and if you truly
[00:32:49] were not thinking like you're in deep
[00:32:51] meditation or you're on a psychedelic or
[00:32:53] you're a Buddha you wouldn't have a
[00:32:55] thought of the self and you would just
[00:32:56] be you just be be aware that's all
[00:32:59] that's all there is I think the
[00:33:00] difference in your state of
[00:33:02] consciousness and mine is one you're
[00:33:04] much older and you've seen life and by
[00:33:06] older I mean brain older not physical
[00:33:08] body older you're a wiser human being
[00:33:11] and I think over the years you've just
[00:33:12] learned to observe and pick up data from
[00:33:15] everywhere U my early life experiences
[00:33:17] kind of catered me towards a deep sense
[00:33:19] of what we call bti in India which is uh
[00:33:22] nisat prame or unselfish love towards
[00:33:25] the Divine it's just an outcome of
[00:33:27] living in India in my eyes yeah no I I
[00:33:30] what matters is truth not who says what
[00:33:33] or what where you lived or what book you
[00:33:35] read what just matters is what's true
[00:33:37] and that you can figure out for yourself
[00:33:39] and you can figure it out just as well
[00:33:40] as me and you probably have your your
[00:33:42] core experience of of your awareness
[00:33:45] same as mine every emotion you felt I
[00:33:48] felt every emotion I felt you felt we're
[00:33:50] human no Human Experience is alien to us
[00:33:52] so we can have all the same feelings and
[00:33:55] thoughts just in different levels and
[00:33:56] different bases um i s i s I sort of
[00:33:59] reject this idea that I'm Wiser or more
[00:34:01] advanced I don't think that's true no if
[00:34:03] I was wise I'd be a Buddha I'm not so
[00:34:05] it's like you know two ants debating
[00:34:07] like you know who's smarter and there's
[00:34:09] like a there's like a human walking
[00:34:11] around over there right what ises it
[00:34:14] matter okay not in our eyes because for
[00:34:16] a lot of dudes in their 20s and 30s you
[00:34:18] are what we want to become especially
[00:34:21] from a peace perspective I'm the same
[00:34:23] guy I've always been and I wouldn't even
[00:34:24] say I'm that peaceful my mind is a wreck
[00:34:27] really yeah I'm always like my mind's
[00:34:29] always running all over the place it's
[00:34:30] it's it's always active you know how you
[00:34:32] said that happiness is peace and motion
[00:34:34] mhm uh that's something that stayed with
[00:34:36] me over the years and it's something I
[00:34:38] practiced the the person who's going to
[00:34:39] know the most about weight loss is the
[00:34:41] person who was fat as a kid the person
[00:34:43] who's going to know the most about peace
[00:34:44] and happiness is the one who was the
[00:34:45] most miserable inside so don't take from
[00:34:49] anything I write to say that I'm some
[00:34:51] peaceful Zen Buddha inside I'm not my
[00:34:52] mind still runs out of control it's I'm
[00:34:54] a crazy person I'm a I'm a crazy person
[00:34:56] who's trying to be a little less crazy
[00:34:58] and observing my own craziness that
[00:35:00] that's how I can come back to you and
[00:35:01] say like you know when I started
[00:35:03] tweeting a lot uh about anything other
[00:35:06] than technology so I I you know I was an
[00:35:08] investor in Twitter early on small
[00:35:09] investor in 2007 and Twitter really
[00:35:13] launched and started getting big around
[00:35:14] 2010 not even big it was still small but
[00:35:17] I was active on Twitter from the start
[00:35:19] but around 2012 2013 I was going through
[00:35:22] a tough period and that's when I started
[00:35:24] tweeting uh the stuff that I was
[00:35:27] supposed to tweet and I you know I
[00:35:30] started getting feedback from people in
[00:35:32] the environment who were like hey that's
[00:35:33] weird you know you're like a VC you're
[00:35:35] like an entrepreneur people not going to
[00:35:37] trust you they think you're strange are
[00:35:38] you high you know that was like a
[00:35:40] constant uh thing and I was just like I
[00:35:43] I don't care I'm just writing to myself
[00:35:45] right and and I was writing down my
[00:35:47] crazier and crazier thoughts uh and I
[00:35:51] for a long time I got no positive
[00:35:52] feedback on it which is fine it's
[00:35:54] actually fine because if you if you're
[00:35:55] doing it for positive feedback you're
[00:35:57] eventually going to end up doing the
[00:35:58] right the wrong thing right I like
[00:35:59] burning my audience I like occasionally
[00:36:01] I'll tweet things that I don't
[00:36:03] completely believe that are a little
[00:36:04] incendiary because I want to find all
[00:36:06] the people who get easily triggered so I
[00:36:08] can block them uh I just want to blow
[00:36:09] them out I don't care about followers
[00:36:11] followers are worthless right if easy
[00:36:13] mechanism to adjust your friend list
[00:36:16] yeah if you're if you're if you're doing
[00:36:18] anything for followers your followers
[00:36:20] are worthless uh you know who would you
[00:36:22] have rather follow you 10 people that
[00:36:23] you respect that are intelligent and
[00:36:25] interesting and wise or like a million
[00:36:26] monkeys so the the follower count thing
[00:36:29] is utterly worthless and I don't even
[00:36:31] want followers I only want peer
[00:36:33] relationships um because follower is
[00:36:35] kind of a weird thing now this this
[00:36:37] person's not thinking for themselves and
[00:36:39] uh no what what every intelligent person
[00:36:41] craves is other intelligent people right
[00:36:44] to help things things through uh and to
[00:36:47] kind of bond with but um I don't know
[00:36:50] where I was going with this but yeah
[00:36:51] screw followers anyway yeah I was I was
[00:36:53] tweeting and I was tweeting like the
[00:36:54] craziness in my mind right I was I'm a
[00:36:56] crazy person
[00:36:58] and so I was just going through my own
[00:36:59] head and trying to sort out my own
[00:37:00] thoughts and it's a complete mess and uh
[00:37:03] it turns out that we all have the same
[00:37:06] internal thoughts and we all have the
[00:37:07] same internal experiences we all do we
[00:37:09] have them in different order maybe we
[00:37:11] interpret different things from them but
[00:37:12] we all have the same feelings so every
[00:37:14] time I put out some late night tweet
[00:37:16] with some crazy thought you know people
[00:37:18] around the world would just be like yeah
[00:37:19] I'm thinking that too um I forget who
[00:37:22] said this there was a great line that I
[00:37:23] read a long time ago but it was
[00:37:25] something like oh I think it was Emerson
[00:37:27] uh and he said uh you know in every
[00:37:30] genius we see our own ordinary thoughts
[00:37:33] but they come back to us with a certain
[00:37:35] alienated
[00:37:36] Majesty right so it's it's just the
[00:37:39] willingness to say it combined with
[00:37:42] saying it in an interesting way so what
[00:37:45] I realized was that what I liked about
[00:37:49] Twitter it was like an open Journal
[00:37:51] which forced me to craft my thoughts it
[00:37:53] would give me feedback obviously because
[00:37:55] people will come out and correct you
[00:37:56] even if you're correct
[00:37:58] and what I enjoyed writing was I liked
[00:38:01] saying things that I thought were true
[00:38:04] that were novel to me in that moment
[00:38:07] obviously anything I can think of
[00:38:08] somebody else has probably thought of
[00:38:10] with very few exceptions
[00:38:13] so it was something novel to me
[00:38:15] something that was true and I would say
[00:38:17] it in an interesting way so that I would
[00:38:20] remember it uh and because I read a lot
[00:38:22] as a kid I tried writing I wasn't I
[00:38:24] didn't have the patience to be a long
[00:38:25] form writer I wrote a few blog posts and
[00:38:27] never even wrote a book and uh I tried
[00:38:30] poetry um because I like reading poetry
[00:38:33] but I didn't care to learn meter and
[00:38:34] Rhythm and rhyme I just cared about the
[00:38:36] words and the and how evocative they
[00:38:38] were and so Twitter was a perfect medium
[00:38:41] for me it allowed me to be to use word
[00:38:44] selection and simple Framing and
[00:38:47] explanation to really hone down things
[00:38:50] that I thought to be true and were
[00:38:51] interesting to me and write them as
[00:38:53] notes to myself and to this day like
[00:38:55] every day I go on Twitter and someone's
[00:38:58] quote tweeted me on something or there's
[00:38:59] like some Nal bot that's like thrown up
[00:39:02] a noal quote and I look at them I'm like
[00:39:03] oh I should follow that advice damn that
[00:39:05] was good like that was written to me
[00:39:07] that's a note to sell from me from five
[00:39:08] years ago I should take my own advice
[00:39:11] it's kind of like you're growing up in
[00:39:12] front of the world yeah it's and we're
[00:39:15] all always growing up right we're all
[00:39:17] we're all always on this journey of
[00:39:20] self-discovery this single player game
[00:39:21] or we're alone inside but yet we're
[00:39:24] deeply interconnected because we're all
[00:39:25] having the same thoughts the same
[00:39:27] emotions the same experiences with maybe
[00:39:29] different interpretations often the same
[00:39:31] interpretations the great questions in
[00:39:33] life the meaning of life or you know
[00:39:36] what am I doing here or what should I do
[00:39:38] uh they all have paradoxical answers uh
[00:39:41] so for example you know does life have
[00:39:43] any meaning uh I could say no life is
[00:39:45] meaningless you you arrive with nothing
[00:39:47] you die nothing survives you you don't
[00:39:50] remember anything as far as you're
[00:39:51] concerned the moment you close your eyes
[00:39:53] at last time the entire universe
[00:39:54] disappears it's like a dream that never
[00:39:56] happened poof no meaning
[00:39:57] okay on the other hand I could say
[00:39:59] actually life has infinite meaning uh
[00:40:01] every moment is connected to every other
[00:40:03] moment you can this it's the only thing
[00:40:06] that actually exists uh you can ascribe
[00:40:09] complete and utter meaning to it right
[00:40:11] uh another question you ask is am I
[00:40:13] alone and yeah of course you're
[00:40:14] completely alone no one else knows your
[00:40:15] thoughts you're single point of
[00:40:17] awareness nobody else can have that same
[00:40:19] point of awareness and any two points
[00:40:21] are infinitely different in space on the
[00:40:23] other hand it could say no of course
[00:40:24] you're not alone the entire universe had
[00:40:26] to conspire to to bring you here at this
[00:40:28] moment it's all particle collisions from
[00:40:29] The Big Bang till now and then poof here
[00:40:31] you are and uh how can you and
[00:40:34] everything that you do is a function of
[00:40:35] your environment and your genes neither
[00:40:37] of which you selected so you're not
[00:40:39] alone you're just you're you're part of
[00:40:41] everything you're you're indispensable
[00:40:43] part of everything um so all of these
[00:40:46] great questions are paradoxical answers
[00:40:49] uh and that's one of the ways that you
[00:40:50] know you're dealing with one of the
[00:40:51] great questions uh and it turns out you
[00:40:54] know if you think it through the reason
[00:40:56] when when you see these par OES often
[00:40:58] what you'll find is that the question is
[00:41:00] being asked you know what is the meaning
[00:41:02] of life but then it's being answered at
[00:41:04] two different levels and one level is a
[00:41:06] level of the individual separate self
[00:41:09] which says oh the meaning is just what I
[00:41:11] ascribe to it um and then sometimes you
[00:41:14] answer it there's a slate of hand and
[00:41:16] you answer it the level of the universal
[00:41:17] self where you say well of course you
[00:41:19] know the meaning is the universe or the
[00:41:21] meaning is life itself um or like am I
[00:41:23] alone if you answer that at the
[00:41:25] individual level then the answer is yes
[00:41:27] if you answer at the universal level the
[00:41:29] answer is no so the paradoxical answers
[00:41:31] come from do you choose to take do you
[00:41:34] choose to adopt the Viewpoint of
[00:41:35] yourself as a separate person or do you
[00:41:38] take the Viewpoint of your spiritual
[00:41:41] self uh and we jump between those those
[00:41:45] contradictions very Loosely without
[00:41:47] paying attention and we end up with
[00:41:49] these paradoxical answers and we think
[00:41:51] the the question is not solvable but
[00:41:53] that's not entirely true it is solvable
[00:41:55] it's just which level are you speaking
[00:41:57] from so for example going back to the
[00:41:59] Buddha a Buddha not the Buddha but a
[00:42:01] Buddha any Buddha any enlightened person
[00:42:03] they don't have any sense of persistent
[00:42:06] separate self and so they're always
[00:42:08] answering at the universal level and in
[00:42:10] that sense they're freed of
[00:42:12] contradictions and I think the reason we
[00:42:14] admire those people is because we
[00:42:15] ourselves want to be freed of this
[00:42:17] internal contradiction uh Bor has had a
[00:42:19] great saying that uh in every human
[00:42:22] there is a sense that something infinite
[00:42:24] has been lost wow and uh I love that
[00:42:27] phrase uh because to me that's kind of
[00:42:31] if if I think about kind of what's going
[00:42:33] on here right I can't prove it so at the
[00:42:36] end of the day you should figure it out
[00:42:37] for yourself but I think what's going on
[00:42:38] here is that there is a universal self
[00:42:41] which is just raw awareness and that's
[00:42:43] all there is everything in your
[00:42:44] experience is awareness in my eyes based
[00:42:47] on what I've read and learned through
[00:42:48] the show uh I feel like Hinduism
[00:42:51] explores exactly this question what is
[00:42:53] the infinite s yeah H Hinduism gets
[00:42:55] closer than anybody else but any ISM
[00:42:57] isn't going to quite get you there cuz
[00:42:59] it's an individual thing you know the
[00:43:00] word Hinduism is not like by modern day
[00:43:03] Hindus we we refer to it as sanatan D
[00:43:05] which is like the Eternal fith yeah and
[00:43:08] what I like about Hinduism is that it
[00:43:11] lets kind of everybody find their own
[00:43:12] way and you can pick your God you can
[00:43:14] pick your path it's a buffet yeah it's a
[00:43:16] buffet and but it has to be because
[00:43:18] there are as many paths as there are
[00:43:19] people uh and because you create an
[00:43:22] individual story right there's kind of
[00:43:24] an awareness or a Consciousness
[00:43:25] everything that you experience
[00:43:27] experience is in this awareness it
[00:43:28] arises in the awareness it's probably
[00:43:30] made of awareness it's known by
[00:43:31] awareness so what else is there
[00:43:33] everything is intermediated through your
[00:43:34] awareness and then on top of that you
[00:43:36] layer your identity and your body and
[00:43:38] your problems and your issues and your
[00:43:40] achievements and your desires and then
[00:43:42] eventually you unlayer all of that and
[00:43:43] you lose that and you go back to this
[00:43:45] undifferentiated awareness which has
[00:43:46] kind of always been around it's
[00:43:48] hypothesis I don't know if it's true a
[00:43:50] lot of people say it you know um and I
[00:43:52] do read a lot of old Indian texts oh
[00:43:54] really yeah well like I I'm a fan of uh
[00:43:58] obviously everyone says bhagad Gita but
[00:43:59] I like the ashtavakra Gita if You' read
[00:44:01] that one uh that's yeah didn't expect
[00:44:04] you to say that no Ash vakar is amazing
[00:44:07] uh vista's yoga which has a lot of the
[00:44:09] Enlightenment stories uh Herman Hesh
[00:44:11] wrote that book sidartha which is kind
[00:44:13] of a fictionalized Buddha story um but
[00:44:16] you know then I've read you know Raja
[00:44:18] yoga and autobiography of Yogi and all
[00:44:20] that stuff Oso Krishna MTI blah blah
[00:44:22] blah Dello uh Michael if if it's I got
[00:44:26] into would call Enlightenment porn and I
[00:44:28] tracked down about a dozen of these
[00:44:29] people in real life and I interviewed
[00:44:31] them and I met them I spent time with
[00:44:33] them and I meditated and I did all that
[00:44:34] stuff but the conclusion I kind of came
[00:44:36] to is that you got to figure it out
[00:44:37] yourself all that stuff is inspirational
[00:44:40] but and uh you can only kind of do it if
[00:44:42] you want to like right now I'm on
[00:44:43] YouTube and I'm watching uh old Krishna
[00:44:46] myy talks I'm watch watching papa Muji
[00:44:49] Rupert spir uh ascendor random Youtube
[00:44:53] videos the guy has like 10 followers but
[00:44:55] he's enlightened the YouTube algorithm
[00:44:57] is really good it finds Enlighten good
[00:44:58] people if you just click around far
[00:44:59] enough um but obviously at some level
[00:45:02] I'm not fully serious about it because
[00:45:04] if I was serious about it I would be
[00:45:05] there but there is a greater truth out
[00:45:06] there again this is a bit of a
[00:45:08] compliment to you in my eyes um you're
[00:45:12] the definition of what a sanatani is in
[00:45:15] terms of exploration and collecting
[00:45:16] knowledge and then coming to a
[00:45:18] conclusion about life and the Divine
[00:45:20] yourself based on your own experiences
[00:45:22] and knowledge then using the shastras
[00:45:23] the ancient books as reference points so
[00:45:27] that's just how I I think we all want to
[00:45:28] know the truth and there's little truths
[00:45:30] and there's big truths and there's
[00:45:31] bigger truths and this is probably the
[00:45:33] biggest truth right and I did cheat I
[00:45:36] skipped to the end I looked at the
[00:45:38] answer uh might have been a mistake to
[00:45:40] be honest because the the point is not
[00:45:42] to earn a PhD in Enlightenment actually
[00:45:44] be enlightened right and so I don't know
[00:45:46] exactly how you get there there doesn't
[00:45:48] seem to be a copyable path but I'm still
[00:45:49] fascinated with it my mind is still
[00:45:51] circling the drain on it does the
[00:45:53] Mahabharat have any influence on your
[00:45:55] mind I don't remember remember too well
[00:45:57] I I think uh now this is where I'm going
[00:45:59] to just offend a lot of people but I
[00:46:01] think that's mostly historical uh thing
[00:46:04] obviously everything you know old Indian
[00:46:06] mythology has a lot of uh spirituality
[00:46:08] weaved into it but no it's not one that
[00:46:10] I've spent much time on okay it's more
[00:46:13] the philosophies like the ashaka Gita
[00:46:15] and all that yeah I love the ashaka Gita
[00:46:17] it's incredible the song of
[00:46:18] self-realization yeah when you're
[00:46:20] reading that stuff yeah is there a part
[00:46:22] of your DNA that feels stimulated being
[00:46:25] Indian you everyone keeps trying to nail
[00:46:27] me on this uh on being Indian
[00:46:31] it's it's it's it's a very brown person
[00:46:34] thing to do well I think I think we want
[00:46:35] a certain pride in being Indian right
[00:46:38] because it was stripped off because it
[00:46:40] was stripped off I think that's exactly
[00:46:41] right and I sort of reject that it was
[00:46:44] stripped off really in the sense that
[00:46:46] I'm just like hey I'm equally valid
[00:46:48] right I don't consider myself inferior
[00:46:50] to anyone I don't consider Superior to
[00:46:51] anyone so in that sense like don't let
[00:46:54] them strip you in the first place that
[00:46:56] you have to then go needing it fulfill
[00:46:58] it and and re really only the individual
[00:47:01] can can truly transcend only the
[00:47:03] individual can rise above whatever is
[00:47:05] facing them um so putting your faith in
[00:47:07] a group identity you're sort of Bound
[00:47:09] for disappointment I mean how many
[00:47:11] Indians are there it's over a billion
[00:47:12] right so there's going to be as many
[00:47:15] points of differentiation as their
[00:47:16] commonality it's not like all billion
[00:47:18] Indians link arm and March do the same
[00:47:19] thing we're not we're not ants um so at
[00:47:23] least I approach it more from an
[00:47:24] individual level I'm happy to be Indian
[00:47:26] I have no objections with it I think
[00:47:27] it's a rich culture uh and I think it's
[00:47:29] you know helped me a lot and half the
[00:47:31] books I read these days were written by
[00:47:33] Indians you know back in the day almost
[00:47:35] all the philosophy I read is Eastern
[00:47:38] philosophy um and the little bit of
[00:47:40] Western philosophy that I like uh
[00:47:41] schopenhauer and Emerson were incredibly
[00:47:45] and D they were incredibly influenced by
[00:47:47] Eastern philosophy they basically just
[00:47:48] cribed Eastern philosophy and they put
[00:47:50] it in western words right um because
[00:47:52] Eastern philosophy has the virtue of
[00:47:54] being correct it's true right right uh
[00:47:57] one side says well you know God has this
[00:47:59] shape this skin color this size lived at
[00:48:02] exactly this time and has exactly these
[00:48:04] rules like skeptical you know the other
[00:48:07] side says well you are the self that
[00:48:08] you're looking for it's all inside of
[00:48:10] you you have to figure it out for
[00:48:11] yourself and you know here are some
[00:48:13] practical steps that you can take
[00:48:14] towards self-realization that seems more
[00:48:16] you know that seems more correct um I
[00:48:19] think it's an outcome of just kind of
[00:48:20] being older like you had more time to
[00:48:22] contemplate I think anyone who is highly
[00:48:24] truth seeking will eventually find their
[00:48:26] way to Eastern
[00:48:28] philosophy uh because it has the virtue
[00:48:30] of being true just like Western science
[00:48:32] has the advantage of being true okay so
[00:48:34] Western physics so when people talk
[00:48:35] about like oh we're going to have
[00:48:36] indigenous math no 2 plus two has to
[00:48:38] equal four right okay we could be wrong
[00:48:41] but I doubt it that's our best theory
[00:48:42] right now that 2 plus 2 equals 4 so I
[00:48:45] Look to Western for science technology
[00:48:47] advancement by the way the East is now
[00:48:49] starting to make strides there as well
[00:48:51] um but when it comes to the oldest
[00:48:54] questions the best answers are the
[00:48:56] oldest ones like the these some of a lot
[00:48:59] of what we've been discussing has been
[00:49:00] around us questions since the dawn of
[00:49:02] mankind so and Indian civilization is
[00:49:05] one of the oldest civilizations it's
[00:49:07] probably the oldest large civilization
[00:49:09] that explored these topics where we have
[00:49:11] written materials and records and
[00:49:13] practitioners and so on um and there's
[00:49:15] probably more Buddhas and alive on the
[00:49:18] Indian subcontinent than there are
[00:49:20] anywhere else in the world so if you're
[00:49:23] attracted to the truth of the old
[00:49:25] questions and you want to find the old
[00:49:27] answers you're going to head there this
[00:49:29] is natural I think there are some
[00:49:31] problems with traveling in India uh
[00:49:34] namely hygiene and it's a little chaotic
[00:49:37] but if one is ever seeking for the right
[00:49:40] answers in life especially when it comes
[00:49:41] to these questions India opens up
[00:49:43] certain portals in your head it can be
[00:49:45] influential that said if if you can't
[00:49:47] figure something like that out exactly
[00:49:50] where you are exactly when you are there
[00:49:53] then it's not true the truth is not
[00:49:56] something that's going to live in a
[00:49:57] certain region at a certain place at a
[00:49:59] certain time and has to be told to you
[00:50:00] by a certain person a certain way that's
[00:50:01] not a truth that's just another
[00:50:03] experience uh so anything that because
[00:50:07] the whole point of spirituality is to be
[00:50:10] freed of the monkey mind and to be at
[00:50:12] peace in the moment and so it can't be
[00:50:14] reliant on anything outside it can't be
[00:50:17] it can't it can't be in the future it
[00:50:18] can't be in a different place uh you
[00:50:20] know one of my problems that I have with
[00:50:22] all religions is this idea that like oh
[00:50:25] this is the word of God and it was p
[00:50:26] down through this book well okay well
[00:50:28] what if I didn't speak that language
[00:50:29] what if I was born at the wrong time no
[00:50:32] any fundamental truth that spiritual has
[00:50:35] to be accessible to every human at every
[00:50:37] time in every place regardless of
[00:50:39] language culture religion age you know
[00:50:41] gender whatever or even physical being
[00:50:45] like you could be you could have mental
[00:50:46] retardation you could be crippled you
[00:50:48] could be dying you should still be able
[00:50:50] to see and find and experience that same
[00:50:51] truth on your own otherwise if it's if
[00:50:54] it's brought to you from the outside if
[00:50:55] it's temporal it can be taken away from
[00:50:56] you and so I think the best path towards
[00:50:59] truth is understanding because when you
[00:51:00] deeply understand something um you're
[00:51:02] not going to unand it it's the nature of
[00:51:05] truth that once you see it once you
[00:51:06] learn it you don't unlearn it because
[00:51:08] it's true that's truth is indestructible
[00:51:10] knowledge in your mind uh it can only be
[00:51:12] replaced by a better truth it can only
[00:51:14] be replaced by oh okay that was that
[00:51:16] truth wasn't complete here's another
[00:51:18] piece of the truth that I was missing um
[00:51:20] but in that sense truth cannot be
[00:51:22] destroyed it can only be overruled by
[00:51:24] other truths so if you find uh some
[00:51:26] understanding then that can be with you
[00:51:29] forever has marriage brought further
[00:51:32] understanding when it comes to
[00:51:34] life I I don't marriage is fine
[00:51:37] household is great I don't like to
[00:51:39] discuss personal life okay I just don't
[00:51:41] think it as relevant to other people's
[00:51:42] lives I I will say like uh you know I
[00:51:45] was talking about this earlier today but
[00:51:48] my own favorite tweet uh to myself is
[00:51:50] the you know a Fit Body a calm mind and
[00:51:52] a house full of love these things cannot
[00:51:54] be bought they must be earned uh and
[00:51:56] house full of love is is that part and
[00:51:58] you can create a house full of love
[00:51:59] anytime you want by giving love uh that
[00:52:01] said you know marriage is complicated
[00:52:03] it's a negotiation uh between people you
[00:52:05] have to learn how to live together you
[00:52:07] have kids it's not easy uh but I'm not
[00:52:09] the person to give marital advice if
[00:52:12] only you will agree
[00:52:14] with it's it's too personal and every
[00:52:17] marriage is so unique and even the
[00:52:19] concept of marriage is sort of going
[00:52:21] away in a lot of Western societies uh uh
[00:52:24] I do encourage children I think children
[00:52:26] are amazing
[00:52:27] everyone should have kids yeah
[00:52:28] absolutely I don't understand this
[00:52:29] anti-natalist thing we here you're here
[00:52:32] I'm here because an unbroken chain of
[00:52:34] our ancestors from tadpoles to monkeys
[00:52:36] to now uh you know had children are you
[00:52:39] going to be the first ones to miss that
[00:52:40] Branch I mean if you believe in some
[00:52:42] afterlife all your ancestors looking
[00:52:43] down you're saying oh my God I can't
[00:52:45] believe it we struggle so hard you know
[00:52:47] we fought Tigers we we we cross
[00:52:49] mountains we we froze during the ice
[00:52:51] ages and this idiot just decided not to
[00:52:53] have children cuz he couldn't be
[00:52:54] bothered
[00:52:57] for bad guy to stop this CH yeah he's
[00:53:00] screwed up right but I will tell you
[00:53:02] like if if you are older in life and you
[00:53:06] don't have the Next Generation to look
[00:53:08] forward to then you better find God fast
[00:53:11] because I don't think like your own mind
[00:53:13] and your own life will be kind to you as
[00:53:14] you get
[00:53:16] older you know what I've learned about
[00:53:18] marriage M from the outside I'm not
[00:53:21] married yet but this is conjectural okay
[00:53:23] uh I think one's wife is always right
[00:53:26] and and that's the rule one should
[00:53:27] follow yeah see I reject that completely
[00:53:29] uh yeah people say like happy wife happy
[00:53:31] life that's all propaganda that's all
[00:53:33] feminine propaganda you're being
[00:53:35] brainwashed no both people have to be
[00:53:37] equally happy uh the secret to a happy
[00:53:40] relationship is two happy people and uh
[00:53:42] you can't be happier than your spouse so
[00:53:44] it's not happy wife happy life it's
[00:53:45] unhappy wife unhappy life you know so so
[00:53:48] you both have to be happy both of you
[00:53:50] have to work hard to make each other
[00:53:51] happy um you have to be a good fit and a
[00:53:54] good match but the point of getting
[00:53:55] married is to have children so so you
[00:53:56] know have the kids and then you know
[00:53:58] worst case you have kids which is still
[00:54:00] an amazing outcome and best case you're
[00:54:02] happily married and you have kids but I
[00:54:04] would I don't buy the you know keep the
[00:54:06] wife happy propaganda that's that's
[00:54:08] that's that's letting her Sher her
[00:54:09] duties it's been kind it's kind of you
[00:54:11] now that that approach would work if I
[00:54:13] asked your fiance or girlfriend and she
[00:54:16] said Oh My Philosophy is like uh you
[00:54:19] know keep the husband happy at all cost
[00:54:20] if she said that then I would be like
[00:54:22] okay that's a good match they're both
[00:54:24] trying to keep each other happy but if
[00:54:25] it's all one-sided no that doesn't work
[00:54:27] yeah I mean personally I'm very sanatani
[00:54:30] yeah and sanatan D says the key to a
[00:54:32] happy relationship is um tolerance and
[00:54:36] selfless service so those are the two
[00:54:38] kind of flag Poes I've got uh after
[00:54:41] finding the right that's good if
[00:54:42] everybody follows it uh you know if both
[00:54:45] people are selfless and tolerant with
[00:54:46] each other then it'll work out well but
[00:54:48] you're not going to be in any voluntary
[00:54:50] relationship where you're selfless and
[00:54:52] tolerant the other person's intolerant
[00:54:53] and selfish it won't last so you can
[00:54:56] only
[00:54:56] make those kind so those are good
[00:54:58] guidelines for society they're not
[00:55:00] necessarily good guidelines for the
[00:55:01] individual uh as an individual mate
[00:55:04] selection is a real thing you have to
[00:55:05] pick a person who you're incredibly
[00:55:07] compatible with uh you know the
[00:55:09] traditional model is that the you know
[00:55:11] the man earns and creates and the woman
[00:55:14] uh kind of takes care of the household
[00:55:15] the man takes care of things outside she
[00:55:16] takes care of things inside that's a
[00:55:18] traditional model I know in the west
[00:55:19] it's falling out of favor but it works
[00:55:21] and in that model the man has to be
[00:55:23] capable and do his duty and the woman
[00:55:25] has to be kind and love loving and you
[00:55:27] know take care of the household and so
[00:55:29] that is a valid model of how the world
[00:55:30] works and you can kind of I don't know
[00:55:32] sonan or whatever you can have some
[00:55:34] prescriptions about how to run that but
[00:55:37] the reality is life is very complicated
[00:55:39] every every individual is completely
[00:55:41] unique the combinatorics of human DNA
[00:55:43] are staggering you'll never meet two
[00:55:44] people who are even vaguely alike if you
[00:55:46] leave a friend you break up with a
[00:55:48] girlfriend you lose a person in your
[00:55:50] life a loved one you're never going to
[00:55:52] find a substitute you're never going to
[00:55:53] find anybody who's like the same or even
[00:55:56] close even close right I've never met
[00:55:59] two human beings who are even vaguely
[00:56:00] similar um except perhaps identical
[00:56:02] twins but that's theoretical I don't
[00:56:04] know any up close that well so if every
[00:56:07] person is unique just imagine how unique
[00:56:09] every relationship is so having other
[00:56:11] people navigate your relationship with
[00:56:13] hard and fast rules doesn't work you can
[00:56:15] look to it for inspiration you can look
[00:56:16] to it for principles but each
[00:56:18] relationship has to work on its own
[00:56:20] merits and I am I am a lazy person and I
[00:56:23] hate conflict so my rule is if a
[00:56:25] relationship has conflict I just leave
[00:56:27] it I don't fight with people if somebody
[00:56:29] wants to fight with me we get one fight
[00:56:31] and then it's over because there's a lot
[00:56:33] of people out there there's a lot of
[00:56:35] people out there and life is long so you
[00:56:37] have to navigate your way towards the
[00:56:39] people who love you for who you are and
[00:56:42] you love them the way they are nobody
[00:56:45] needs anybody to change and if they
[00:56:47] change it's okay because you still kind
[00:56:48] of value the core and you change
[00:56:50] together um the same way like you find
[00:56:52] you have to navigate your way to the
[00:56:53] career the job the profession the
[00:56:55] obsession where you like the thing for
[00:56:57] what it is the the moment is complete in
[00:57:00] of itself as you perform that act and if
[00:57:02] you get some reward out of it that's
[00:57:03] fantastic but that's not the core reason
[00:57:05] you do it um and the same way U I think
[00:57:09] you can apply that to every facet of
[00:57:11] your life even if you're eating you want
[00:57:13] to find the healthy food that you
[00:57:14] actually enjoy eating there's many
[00:57:16] healthy foods out there just find the
[00:57:18] ones that you enjoy eating and just
[00:57:19] focus down on those uh for exercise find
[00:57:22] the sport or the hobby where you it
[00:57:24] doesn't feel like work to you like play
[00:57:25] tennis or you know if you like running
[00:57:27] then go run if you like lifting then go
[00:57:29] lift if you like playing tennis then go
[00:57:30] play tennis so I think uh the the beauty
[00:57:33] of Modern Life is it gives us so many
[00:57:36] options uh and that's not a bad thing
[00:57:38] options are good uh it's just you have
[00:57:40] to navigate your way through the options
[00:57:42] and find out what works for you and then
[00:57:43] commit to that and so on relationships I
[00:57:46] don't view uh and I know this is uh
[00:57:49] antithetical to the classical Indian way
[00:57:51] of arranged marriage which had its
[00:57:52] merits that was basically saying hey
[00:57:54] let's find someone who's culturally
[00:57:55] similar socioeconomically similar uh you
[00:57:58] know worthy of you and the purpose of
[00:58:00] marriage is to build a household and
[00:58:02] have children so we'll take care of the
[00:58:03] basics didn't always work but you know
[00:58:05] pretty good hit rate compared to Modern
[00:58:07] where it's just like I'm going to marry
[00:58:08] my high school sweetheart or I'll roll
[00:58:10] the dice or oh I got this girl pregnant
[00:58:11] accidentally and then off we go so it
[00:58:14] can work better than some models but in
[00:58:15] a choice-based model which is where
[00:58:17] Western Society is and I think
[00:58:18] increasingly Eastern Society is there um
[00:58:21] you have to be picky uh so if you're
[00:58:24] having to sacrifice for your SP spouse
[00:58:26] and they're not sacrificing in return
[00:58:27] just go somewhere else if you're in
[00:58:29] constant conflict then both of you need
[00:58:31] to go find someone who's you're not each
[00:58:33] of you is not going to be in constant
[00:58:35] conflict with and I think that's a much
[00:58:36] better recipe that that ability to
[00:58:38] search and to look uh and to cut your
[00:58:40] losses quickly uh because there's High
[00:58:42] sunk cost in these relationships the the
[00:58:44] biggest problem in relationships is
[00:58:46] dishonesty where we're trying to make
[00:58:48] the other person happy we're trying to
[00:58:49] appear our best and so for the first
[00:58:52] year of the relationship you just fake
[00:58:53] it you just you're just a different
[00:58:54] person and sometimes that's just your
[00:58:56] emotions are driving you and you're in
[00:58:58] love so you're being on your best
[00:58:59] behavior without even thinking about it
[00:59:00] and sometimes it's a little more
[00:59:01] deliberate but the reality is the longer
[00:59:04] you fake it the worse it's going to be
[00:59:06] because then you get trapped and now
[00:59:08] it's sunk cost and you don't want to
[00:59:09] walk away and breaking that relationship
[00:59:11] is hard and your friends and family
[00:59:12] expect you together and you can't
[00:59:13] imagine life separately uh and now
[00:59:15] you're stuck uh so it's just better to
[00:59:17] be brutally honest upfront about who you
[00:59:20] are and your needs and your worst sides
[00:59:22] and and all of that and don't try to
[00:59:24] throw off any Impressions because if
[00:59:26] eventually this person will see you at
[00:59:27] your worst and eventually you will see
[00:59:29] them at their worst um so you might as
[00:59:31] well just start there you know from the
[00:59:33] outside looking in I personally have
[00:59:36] this impression of Naval rikan the brand
[00:59:39] and the human and I feel like nothing
[00:59:41] hurts that guy does anything hurt you at
[00:59:45] all uh you know I'm a very paranoid
[00:59:48] person uh so I do stress out about uh
[00:59:51] you know um I I grew up with very little
[00:59:54] so I'm always stressed stressing over
[00:59:55] like like politicians and money you know
[00:59:58] like the West has now come become very
[01:00:00] fashionable to hate money to hate wealth
[01:00:02] to hate entrepreneurs to try to tear
[01:00:05] people down uh We've turned into cancel
[01:00:07] culture right so yeah so you know those
[01:00:10] kinds of things occasionally stress me
[01:00:11] out um but I would say
[01:00:14] that
[01:00:16] um there's there's not anything I
[01:00:19] want right need is the need is the
[01:00:22] ultimate monkey other than knowledge
[01:00:24] right I have not even that like what is
[01:00:27] knowledge going to do for me I'm going
[01:00:28] to die it's all going to go to zero
[01:00:29] anyway so it's fun I enjoy learning
[01:00:32] things I love the aha moment when I
[01:00:34] connect something together and I would
[01:00:35] tweak it a little bit I would say it's
[01:00:37] understanding not knowledge knowledge is
[01:00:38] because knowledge gets conflated with
[01:00:39] memorization and you know memorizing
[01:00:41] facts and I got chat GPT for that and
[01:00:44] the internet um so I enjoy understanding
[01:00:47] I enjoy learning
[01:00:49] um my my own tweet to myself on this was
[01:00:52] spend your life in the company of
[01:00:53] geniuses sages children and books
[01:00:56] right those are the four things that I
[01:00:58] enjoy the most and there's a fifth thing
[01:01:00] a great Indian
[01:01:01] podcaster I thought you were going to
[01:01:03] say you're wife or a woman uh she's
[01:01:06] gonna she's gonna nail you on this one
[01:01:08] um I I think uh not there was there was
[01:01:13] an old thing a story that I was liked
[01:01:14] about Socrates where they took him into
[01:01:18] um they took him into the quent of the
[01:01:20] mall the market and there were all these
[01:01:22] luxuries and fineries and and things
[01:01:24] laid out and and Delicacies to eat and
[01:01:27] he
[01:01:28] said there are so many things in this
[01:01:31] world that I do not want and I was like
[01:01:33] oh that's power that's that's it right
[01:01:35] there right or when Alexander the Great
[01:01:38] met diogenes uh who was living in a
[01:01:40] barrel uh you know Alexander was like I
[01:01:43] wish if I came back in their life that I
[01:01:45] could be like diogenes and diynes said
[01:01:47] something along the lines so well if I
[01:01:49] came back I wouldn't want to be
[01:01:51] Alexander right so being freed from need
[01:01:54] is the ultimate but I'm not I'm not a
[01:01:56] Buddha I'm not the guy who's going to
[01:01:57] suddenly renounce everything and not
[01:01:58] have a need uh and renunciation doesn't
[01:02:00] work anyway uh but it's more that you
[01:02:04] know I like games I think we all like
[01:02:06] games we all play games we play the
[01:02:07] social game we play the video games we
[01:02:09] play the money games we play the fitness
[01:02:11] game we play The Fame game we play the
[01:02:13] love game we play the happiness game we
[01:02:14] all play
[01:02:15] games and I've played a lot of games my
[01:02:18] whole life of every kind and I've won a
[01:02:22] lot of games and the reason to win the
[01:02:24] game is so you can be done with it so
[01:02:27] you can see through it if you just keep
[01:02:29] playing the same game over and over and
[01:02:31] over grinding you know trying to go
[01:02:32] higher and higher and higher maybe that
[01:02:34] works for somebody it doesn't work for
[01:02:36] me so I like to either see through games
[01:02:39] or I like to be done with them so I used
[01:02:42] to be an avid video gamer until very
[01:02:44] recently actually this a couple of years
[01:02:45] back maybe like five years ago I
[01:02:47] probably spent more time playing video
[01:02:48] games than I spent working did it do
[01:02:50] anything for your mind it was fun uh
[01:02:53] yeah probably I mean it was I was
[01:02:55] playing harder than harder games and
[01:02:56] more and more intellectual games and
[01:02:58] strategy games and War games and
[01:02:59] thinking games but they're just games
[01:03:00] they're meaningless games right what was
[01:03:03] your favorite there were so many I mean
[01:03:05] mostly war games I was a I was a deep
[01:03:08] war game magic the Gathering if you
[01:03:09] remember that game you know so
[01:03:12] anyway theic game doesn't matter the
[01:03:14] point is I would just play lots and lots
[01:03:16] of games and at some deep deep level I
[01:03:18] knew they were worthless because you
[01:03:21] know you're playing this game and then
[01:03:22] you get some stupid reward at the end
[01:03:23] and then they change the rules of that
[01:03:25] game and then the game changes in like
[01:03:27] your your reset or like you you forgot
[01:03:29] your login or you lost it cuz you
[01:03:31] upgraded your computer or your whatever
[01:03:33] or this they rolled out version five
[01:03:34] against a version four you're starting
[01:03:35] all over right so you know it's
[01:03:38] worthless you're just running in a
[01:03:39] circle right and all games are worthless
[01:03:41] because you die in the end but at least
[01:03:43] some are longer live than others right
[01:03:44] there are games that like for example if
[01:03:47] I'm playing the wealth creation game I
[01:03:48] can make money which has an actual
[01:03:50] effect on my remaining life as opposed
[01:03:53] to just playing a video game which has
[01:03:54] none of that benefit
[01:03:56] I'm not taking away from games games are
[01:03:58] useful uh they're they're training for
[01:03:59] the intellectual athlete just like
[01:04:01] sports might be training for War for the
[01:04:03] physical athlete um that
[01:04:05] said I was still playing a lot of games
[01:04:07] I knew they were kind of worthless I was
[01:04:09] doing it to blow off steam or just
[01:04:11] because I don't even need a reason I was
[01:04:12] it was entertaining um but then one day
[01:04:16] I read a blog post and uh you know truth
[01:04:19] is that when you see it you can't unsee
[01:04:21] it and this guy in just the right turn
[01:04:23] of phrase he called games a shadow
[01:04:25] career he said games are a shadow career
[01:04:29] and I was like oh that's so good that is
[01:04:30] so good it's like a career that you're
[01:04:32] building that's fake you know it's a
[01:04:34] shadow it's just going to disappear I
[01:04:36] was like and and since that moment I
[01:04:38] haven't been able to see games as
[01:04:39] anything other than a waste of time so I
[01:04:42] still do play games occasionally so once
[01:04:44] in a blue moon mostly with my kid I'll
[01:04:46] pick up a game I'll play for a little
[01:04:47] bit but now I'm thoroughly in completely
[01:04:50] aware that it is a quote unquote waste
[01:04:52] of a time and if I'm okay wasting the
[01:04:53] time it's fine but these days I'm not
[01:04:55] really okay wasting time you still play
[01:04:57] war games with your kid uh I'm going to
[01:04:59] pick one or two up uh mostly these days
[01:05:01] though they're on their iPads playing
[01:05:03] their own games it's fine but what what
[01:05:05] game would you have your kid play and I
[01:05:06] asked this from the perspective of I
[01:05:08] feel when I was growing up as a teenager
[01:05:11] few games that really affected my
[01:05:12] mindset in life FIFA uh like the
[01:05:15] football game because it just teaches
[01:05:16] you something about team play uh Age of
[01:05:19] Empires obviously because you learn
[01:05:21] strategy Sim City because you learn
[01:05:22] Administration and Sims because you
[01:05:24] learn about self
[01:05:26] I mean look I I can argue for many of
[01:05:28] them I can argue for The Sims and the
[01:05:30] civilization type games I can argue for
[01:05:32] board games war games uh strategy games
[01:05:36] um the reality is even the few games I
[01:05:39] play these days they're just like
[01:05:40] runners or Jumpers or Fighters you know
[01:05:42] they don't have any real meaning to them
[01:05:44] it's fine
[01:05:47] there's I think one of the one of my
[01:05:49] tweets or analogies that went more viral
[01:05:52] than others was like I really believe
[01:05:54] that you should live your life like an
[01:05:56] athlete or like a lion right which means
[01:05:58] that most of your time you're resting
[01:06:00] you're just fussing around uh you're
[01:06:02] lazing around you're just doing whatever
[01:06:04] you find entertaining and then once in a
[01:06:06] while you get obsessed with something
[01:06:07] and something is important and you just
[01:06:09] pour everything into it so I would
[01:06:11] rather be recharged and ready for my
[01:06:13] next intellectual or physical Obsession
[01:06:15] than putting myself on the grinder of I
[01:06:18] have to wake up at this time then eat my
[01:06:19] blueberries and then do my push-ups and
[01:06:22] and just like live a regimented
[01:06:23] mechanical life uh I want to live a very
[01:06:25] free life I don't want a calendar I
[01:06:27] don't want have to be in a specific
[01:06:28] place at a specific time I don't want
[01:06:30] have to answer to people um I just want
[01:06:33] to be free and I think that's how you do
[01:06:35] your best work and especially in an age
[01:06:37] where we have so much leverage in the
[01:06:39] system either through code or Media or
[01:06:42] through other people or through Capital
[01:06:44] the quality of your decision- making
[01:06:45] dominates everything um Warren Buffett
[01:06:48] is one of the richest men in the world
[01:06:49] just because he makes a right decision
[01:06:50] once a year and so having a clear mind
[01:06:53] is way more important than anything else
[01:06:55] which and this is all exuse for
[01:06:57] laziness which just lets me relax and
[01:06:59] relax and relax until I need to make
[01:07:01] that decision but it's like even if I
[01:07:02] look at my you know
[01:07:05] um uh you know having made money in life
[01:07:08] has happened through a bunch of
[01:07:09] different sources but the number one was
[01:07:11] like way bigger than the number two
[01:07:12] through end put together two number two
[01:07:14] was bigger than three through nend put
[01:07:16] together three was bigger than four
[01:07:17] through nend put together and that's
[01:07:18] kind of how your entire life Works what
[01:07:20] was number one if you don't mind me I'm
[01:07:22] not going to get into it but it's uh but
[01:07:24] it it's it the compound interest applies
[01:07:26] in all intellectual and often even in
[01:07:29] relationship domains uh so for example
[01:07:31] your number one relationship in your
[01:07:33] life eventually your kids currently your
[01:07:35] wife maybe one of your parents is going
[01:07:37] to be more valuable to you than kind of
[01:07:39] all the rest put together right there so
[01:07:42] maybe not so much in relationships but
[01:07:44] definitely in definitely in uh learning
[01:07:47] you know your best ideas is going to be
[01:07:48] worth more than all the rest my best
[01:07:50] Tweets the few best Tweets you know
[01:07:52] you're only judging your best work not
[01:07:53] your worst so in that sense being high
[01:07:55] output is really good current generation
[01:07:57] May judge you on your average but the
[01:07:59] future what'll happen is let's say you
[01:08:01] record I don't know how many podcasts
[01:08:02] have you recorded 800 800 great so you
[01:08:04] know by the time you're done you'll
[01:08:05] probably have 2,000 or something before
[01:08:07] you're finally like okay I'm bored of
[01:08:08] this game right so let's say you have
[01:08:10] 2,000 podcasts in your life what's going
[01:08:11] to happen is 20 of them are going to be
[01:08:13] amazing okay and those will stand the
[01:08:15] test of time and they'll slowly trickle
[01:08:17] down trickle down trickle down 100 years
[01:08:18] from now people will be watching 20 of
[01:08:20] them and then 200 years from now 300
[01:08:22] years from now they'll be watching one
[01:08:23] of them right so it's you so in all of
[01:08:26] these intellectual domains you are only
[01:08:29] judged by your best work in posterity
[01:08:32] which is not to say you can just
[01:08:33] shortcut to it but most effort in life
[01:08:35] in that sense is wasted but it's both
[01:08:38] training wheels for the winning one plus
[01:08:40] you just never know when or where the
[01:08:42] right thing is going to emerge so you
[01:08:43] kind of just have to keep moving um but
[01:08:46] I I the thing I'm not a fan of is
[01:08:48] wasting time wasting time you know
[01:08:51] tedious meetings with tedious people uh
[01:08:54] you know traveling to places for for
[01:08:55] business where there's like you don't
[01:08:57] actually enjoy it um anything ceremonial
[01:09:00] or ritual meetings you know complete
[01:09:03] with of time most meetings uh just save
[01:09:06] your time save your energy um just be
[01:09:09] happy enjoy yourself and be and be ready
[01:09:12] for the opportunity because there there
[01:09:14] a time when opportunity comes and if you
[01:09:17] yourself are rested and ready and you
[01:09:19] find yourself interested in it then you
[01:09:21] have the space in your life and in your
[01:09:24] mind that you can be sucked into it um
[01:09:27] and again without any uh desire for a
[01:09:31] specific outcome because when you desire
[01:09:33] for a specific outcome you're moving
[01:09:34] away from truth seeking because now
[01:09:36] you're looking for something and if that
[01:09:37] thing turns out not to be true you're
[01:09:39] going to try and force it and we can't
[01:09:41] help it we're Desiring creatures you
[01:09:42] wouldn't even be here on this Earth if
[01:09:43] you weren't a Desiring creature right
[01:09:44] you just lie there in the dirt and let
[01:09:46] worms eat you so you are a Desiring
[01:09:48] creature but you just have to be careful
[01:09:49] with your desires because they will take
[01:09:50] you away from your truth because uh true
[01:09:53] true reasoning is UN motivated it's or
[01:09:56] it's motivated purely by curiosity
[01:09:59] curiosity just means you want to know
[01:10:00] the truth that's all it is so in that
[01:10:02] sense curiosity is the pure Mo
[01:10:04] motivation every other motivation is
[01:10:06] motivated reasoning and leads you to is
[01:10:07] more likely to lead you to an incorrect
[01:10:09] answer and then the worst thing you can
[01:10:11] do is get through motivated reasoning
[01:10:13] get to the falsehood and then you bake
[01:10:17] that into your identity you identify it
[01:10:19] with yourself you say well because I'm a
[01:10:20] Hindu or I'm a Christian or I believe
[01:10:22] this or because I'm a Republican or
[01:10:23] Democrat I believe this and then you get
[01:10:26] locked into that now that is a part of
[01:10:28] your understanding it's a shaky
[01:10:29] foundation and then you start attaching
[01:10:31] other things to that shaky Foundation
[01:10:32] politics is a good example of this well
[01:10:34] you know because I you know believe in
[01:10:38] uh women's right for abortion now I also
[01:10:40] have to believe that you know trans
[01:10:42] women or men or men or women and I have
[01:10:44] to believe that like you know there's no
[01:10:46] heritability in certain things but there
[01:10:47] is in other things I have to believe
[01:10:48] that capitalism is evil you start
[01:10:50] plugging all these things together that
[01:10:51] don't actually belong together they're
[01:10:52] voting coalitions they're coalitions of
[01:10:54] Voters that have assemble single issue
[01:10:56] voters but now all of a sudden you have
[01:10:57] to adopt all of these beliefs or in
[01:10:59] Christian you know if I'm Christian then
[01:11:00] I have to believe this and this and this
[01:11:01] otherwise I'm not a true Christian I
[01:11:03] have to believe this and this Hindu sect
[01:11:05] otherwise not a true Hindu all that is
[01:11:07] nonsense one of the best lines I heard
[01:11:09] on this was Buddha wasn't a Buddhist you
[01:11:11] know so all the people that you admire
[01:11:13] all the people that you look up to
[01:11:15] they're they're not they don't strongly
[01:11:16] self-identify with any movement you know
[01:11:18] lean you created Singapore where we're
[01:11:20] sitting today he didn't consider himself
[01:11:23] Singaporean right he created that thing
[01:11:25] so I think uh all of us are meant to not
[01:11:30] okay not nobody's meant to do anything
[01:11:31] but all of us function at our best when
[01:11:34] we don't identify with anything outside
[01:11:36] of
[01:11:37] ourselves the one thing that this
[01:11:39] conversation is teaching me is that uh
[01:11:42] the universe is kind of wired to us
[01:11:44] up a little
[01:11:46] bit well it would have to be to be
[01:11:48] interesting right if you could just if
[01:11:51] it was predictable it' be boring there
[01:11:52] be no point in being here is this the
[01:11:55] most most unserious podcast that you've
[01:11:56] ever done I don't
[01:11:58] know probably maybe I don't know are you
[01:12:01] comfortable being unserious sure yeah
[01:12:04] I'm comfortable being me I mean I was so
[01:12:07] intimidated by the thought of speaking
[01:12:09] to you but once I got talking to you uh
[01:12:13] I've just realized that you're like any
[01:12:15] of us you've just done the right things
[01:12:18] consistently and you've done the things
[01:12:20] that you felt were easy but made a habit
[01:12:21] out of a few other difficult things I
[01:12:24] think if there's one thing that my
[01:12:27] friends would say is that like I try to
[01:12:30] figure everything out for myself I don't
[01:12:33] listen to anybody else not even your
[01:12:35] wife
[01:12:36] nobody your kid nobody really yeah no
[01:12:40] gurus no mentors no teachers no holy
[01:12:44] this or that I mean I I definitely have
[01:12:46] learned from people for sure I've almost
[01:12:48] everything I know I've learned from
[01:12:50] other people but I verified it for
[01:12:52] myself is your work your Guru my work
[01:12:55] work I don't
[01:12:56] work you you know how you have that
[01:12:58] saying about you choose something that
[01:13:00] feels like play to you but work for
[01:13:01] others oh yeah yeah yeah and I think
[01:13:03] once you advance in that journey of play
[01:13:06] it turns into art after a point and
[01:13:08] that's how you look at all the products
[01:13:10] that you invest in that they art for you
[01:13:12] do they teach you things for life okay
[01:13:15] whether it's in politics science
[01:13:16] business spirituality whatever history
[01:13:18] remembers the artists the artists are
[01:13:20] the people who are creative and March to
[01:13:22] their own beat and do their own thing um
[01:13:25] great software is Art great business is
[01:13:27] Art starting even like starting a new
[01:13:29] country you know some level is Art
[01:13:32] you're creating x n Hilo you're creating
[01:13:33] something out of nothing um and uh that
[01:13:38] to me is like the most rewarding thing
[01:13:40] to be doing at any given time but art
[01:13:42] can't be forced uh it can't in a sense
[01:13:45] art is done for its own sake it's not
[01:13:48] done for any external purpose if you're
[01:13:49] doing it for money it's less you're
[01:13:52] you're hurting it's uh it's cap ility to
[01:13:55] be Arts not to say it can't still be
[01:13:56] great art but you're just you're now
[01:14:00] beholden to other interests it's like
[01:14:01] motivated reasoning it's like true
[01:14:03] scientists try to figure things out to
[01:14:06] fulfill their desire to figure things
[01:14:08] out right and the moment they figure it
[01:14:10] out it's complete they don't need a
[01:14:12] Nobel Prize or a Fields medal afterwards
[01:14:14] and in fact some of the better ones have
[01:14:15] rejected that or like uh famously Bob
[01:14:17] Dylan I think rejected the pz or Prize
[01:14:19] or whatever it was like he got some
[01:14:21] massive prize didn't even show up didn't
[01:14:22] even bother cuz he knows his music is
[01:14:24] good he created for himself so I I do
[01:14:27] think that is the highest calling
[01:14:28] creating something for yourself because
[01:14:30] you want to exist now nobody's perfect
[01:14:32] we're not all going to get there um and
[01:14:34] there's always going to be external
[01:14:36] motivations but the less the more
[01:14:38] internally motivated you can be the more
[01:14:41] the thing itself is the reward um the
[01:14:44] better the work you will do um and uh
[01:14:47] the more F fulfilling it it is so that's
[01:14:50] kind of what I aim for okay but maybe
[01:14:52] that's just my excuse for being useless
[01:14:53] these days okay
[01:14:55] um you know again everyone views the
[01:14:57] world with the lens that their own mind
[01:15:00] has placed due to their own stories MH
[01:15:03] so the lens I view the world with is
[01:15:05] honestly pretty spiritual and I know you
[01:15:07] don't like the word but again it's an
[01:15:08] outcome of growing up in India in my
[01:15:10] eyes um there's a concept of the flow
[01:15:13] state state of flow where your best work
[01:15:15] happens and I've always wondered to
[01:15:17] myself about your Flow State nal's Flow
[01:15:20] State and for me at least based on
[01:15:22] what's visible to the public eye it
[01:15:24] happens when you're TW eting when you're
[01:15:25] in one of your speet storms and it
[01:15:27] happens when someone's asking you the
[01:15:29] right questions and unlocking things am
[01:15:31] I right in like yeah I mean in a flow
[01:15:33] State your mind isn't uh obsessing with
[01:15:36] itself it's you're not thinking about
[01:15:37] yourself you're focused on the thing
[01:15:40] you're focused on the activity uh it's a
[01:15:42] meditative State it's it's a state where
[01:15:44] like for example if you're drawing or
[01:15:46] painting then you are the brush you are
[01:15:49] the paint you're only thinking about
[01:15:51] that and there is no internal chatter
[01:15:53] you're not saying oh man you know can't
[01:15:55] wait for dinner or I can't believe my
[01:15:56] wife said this to me that that's all
[01:15:58] gone and that's and you're also
[01:16:01] operating at the edge of your capability
[01:16:03] so it's interesting enough that you you
[01:16:06] are being stressed you're being strained
[01:16:08] you know you're operating at the edge
[01:16:10] but it's not so far forward that you are
[01:16:12] being confused or you're like obviously
[01:16:15] screwing up um so flow state is a
[01:16:17] wonderful thing it's it's a very
[01:16:19] meditative State
[01:16:21] um but probably the the shortest way to
[01:16:24] not be in a flow state is to try to be
[01:16:26] in a flow state right because it's again
[01:16:29] it's that effort right so it comes much
[01:16:31] more from you find things that you like
[01:16:33] to do and then when you and because you
[01:16:36] like to do something you're interested
[01:16:37] in it you're going to get good at it
[01:16:38] you're going to be doing it and as
[01:16:40] you're doing it you're climbing that
[01:16:41] ladder of uh of Mastery and any you can
[01:16:44] climb that ladder in literally anything
[01:16:46] um as you get more and more into it um
[01:16:49] you're going to be more and more in flow
[01:16:51] uh I my problem is I switch around a lot
[01:16:54] so I fall in love with something I
[01:16:57] obsess over it I learn everything I
[01:16:59] possibly can about it over a couple of
[01:17:01] months kind of period and then once I
[01:17:03] figure the basics out 8020 I start
[01:17:06] getting bored and then when I start
[01:17:08] getting bored I just sort of background
[01:17:10] it I becomes a piece of my knowledge and
[01:17:13] understanding and then I just move on to
[01:17:15] the next thing or I just spend time
[01:17:16] being bored until the next thing comes
[01:17:18] along do you think that the Flow State
[01:17:22] sometimes allows you to channelize
[01:17:24] knowledge
[01:17:25] that's present
[01:17:27] externally I don't know what I'm going
[01:17:30] to say until I say it so it's kind of
[01:17:33] funny that one of the ways that I learn
[01:17:34] what I think is by saying it and the
[01:17:36] same way one of the ways that I learn
[01:17:39] what I know is by tweeting it so very
[01:17:41] often I'll just be talking with a friend
[01:17:43] I'll be hanging out I'll be having
[01:17:44] dinner or I'll be sitting at home by
[01:17:45] myself late at night and I'll just have
[01:17:47] a thought and I'll come into my mind
[01:17:49] almost fully baked and I'm like oh I
[01:17:51] should tweet that and then I'll tweet it
[01:17:53] and then sometimes I have a second
[01:17:54] thought I better changed this and
[01:17:55] usually the first version is always the
[01:17:57] best uh I don't know where it comes from
[01:17:59] it's kind of interesting it comes from
[01:18:00] Beyond whatever that means right maybe
[01:18:02] it comes from the depths of my mind
[01:18:03] maybe comes from somewhere else but they
[01:18:05] come to me fully formed which is kind of
[01:18:07] the entertaining thing I mean I'm of the
[01:18:08] belief that it comes from somewhere
[01:18:10] else creativity is a mysterious Force
[01:18:13] right yeah I don't know I mean that's
[01:18:16] again I keep bringing this up man but
[01:18:18] when I'm talking to you I feel like I'm
[01:18:20] talking to Rishi you know Rishi is so uh
[01:18:23] kind of embarrassing sorry
[01:18:25] but that's that's what it feels like so
[01:18:27] you know on a very Primal level the
[01:18:29] podcast for me is based on my childhood
[01:18:32] dream of wanting to explore the
[01:18:33] Himalayas and have conversations with
[01:18:35] sages and I'm just like making money off
[01:18:37] of it right now spend your life in the
[01:18:38] company of geniuses sages children and
[01:18:40] books right yeah but again this is one
[01:18:43] of those things that figured through the
[01:18:44] show whenever I speak to monks they keep
[01:18:45] talking about the Flow State how it is
[01:18:47] meditative it is a form of working your
[01:18:51] mind towards Evolution but one needs to
[01:18:53] be humble with in the Flow State and
[01:18:55] understand that it's not their own
[01:18:57] thoughts and creativity but it's being
[01:18:58] placed in their head externally by the
[01:19:00] yeah in a real Flow State you're not
[01:19:02] thinking about yourself so it's not
[01:19:04] coming from this look when when we self
[01:19:08] is a very loaded word right it's another
[01:19:09] one of the self it's another one of
[01:19:11] these words that can mean a lot of
[01:19:12] different things
[01:19:13] but there's kind of the separate self
[01:19:16] the identity the story The Character the
[01:19:18] name the uh kind of the the emotional
[01:19:23] predilections toward doing certain
[01:19:24] certain things and not doing others the
[01:19:26] reactions the memories that's the false
[01:19:29] self okay we know that from Hinduism and
[01:19:32] Buddhism and Hindu mythology and they've
[01:19:34] written it down much better than I could
[01:19:36] ever say um that's the false self but
[01:19:39] yet that's the self that we function
[01:19:40] under 95% of the time and when we go
[01:19:43] into a flow state that self quiets down
[01:19:46] for a bit and then All That Remains is
[01:19:49] true self which is
[01:19:53] just I don't have a name for it maybe
[01:19:55] you have name for it it's just the thing
[01:19:56] that is right it's existence itself it's
[01:19:59] Consciousness it's awareness to me
[01:20:00] they're identical right as an aside one
[01:20:02] of the I think I think there's a lot of
[01:20:04] great questions out there that people
[01:20:05] just don't ask because they're so
[01:20:06] cliched right so uh one of the questions
[01:20:09] I love is like if a tree falls in the
[01:20:11] forest and there's no one around to hear
[01:20:12] it doesn't make a sound so cliche I
[01:20:15] think about that one all the time you
[01:20:16] know because it really asks a question
[01:20:19] like you know is existence and are
[01:20:21] existence and Consciousness the same
[01:20:23] thing like in what sense can something
[01:20:26] be said to exist if nothing is ever
[01:20:28] conscious of it or its or its effects um
[01:20:31] another one that I like to think about
[01:20:33] is the philosophical zombie problem
[01:20:35] which is uh you know why do we even need
[01:20:37] Consciousness why couldn't you just be
[01:20:39] walking around reacting like an
[01:20:40] automaton to everything and I could see
[01:20:42] the exact same reactions the exact same
[01:20:44] emotions and whatever but you just don't
[01:20:45] need to be conscious why why why does
[01:20:47] that why aren't we all just uh philosop
[01:20:50] why aren't we all just zombies um and
[01:20:52] actually it's funny because the Buddhist
[01:20:54] answer to that is if you think it
[01:20:55] through it's kind of it's not why
[01:20:58] Consciousness the answer is why zombie
[01:21:00] like does the zombie actually exist or
[01:21:01] is that just a figment of the you know
[01:21:04] awareness's imagination um another one
[01:21:07] that I like is uh you know some of the
[01:21:09] wisdom that's really old is so embedded
[01:21:11] in culture we don't think about it uh
[01:21:13] row row row your boat you know that one
[01:21:15] row row row your boat gently down the
[01:21:16] stream yeah it's so smart nobody thinks
[01:21:19] about it nobody talks it's so smart
[01:21:20] that's that's like one of the greatest
[01:21:21] works of art ever created row row row
[01:21:23] your boat in other words your work right
[01:21:25] the analogy is you're sitting in a boat
[01:21:27] you're kind of by yourself yeah there
[01:21:28] might be other boats but you're kind of
[01:21:29] by yourself you're rowing you got to row
[01:21:31] you got to do some work gently down the
[01:21:33] stream gently yeah you don't struggle
[01:21:35] too much you know you kind of have to
[01:21:36] figure out what you can navigate without
[01:21:39] getting all stressed out down the stream
[01:21:42] it's a good analogy for Life the river
[01:21:44] you know it's going off you know it's
[01:21:45] going to die at the end um merrily
[01:21:48] merrily merily merily yeah that's that's
[01:21:49] the right attitude life is but a dream
[01:21:52] that's the cold hard truth life is but a
[01:21:54] dream it appears it disappears it ends
[01:21:57] Infinity on both sides right there's so
[01:21:59] much wisdom in that little poem and
[01:22:01] stuck around forever but instead we have
[01:22:03] to go looking at complicated books to
[01:22:04] figure this out as I've learned through
[01:22:06] the show they say that the curse of
[01:22:08] human life is that once you die you
[01:22:11] realize that human life was the
[01:22:14] dream yeah I mean nobody knows what
[01:22:17] happens when you die right that's kind
[01:22:18] of the mystery that makes it all fun um
[01:22:21] but you know to your point about being
[01:22:23] attracted to like Indian
[01:22:25] uh sort of ideals and memories I I have
[01:22:28] found as I grow older I gravitate more
[01:22:30] and more towards those things like um do
[01:22:33] you mind that I'm bringing it up so much
[01:22:34] in this conv no no it's fine it's fine
[01:22:36] anything is fine it's just a part of my
[01:22:38] identity yeah it's fine I mean I'm
[01:22:40] Indian too by origin and probably will
[01:22:43] end up back there at some point when I'm
[01:22:44] old enough you know I think about it I I
[01:22:47] like India I love India these are these
[01:22:49] are these are my brothers and sisters
[01:22:51] right these are my people I am I am one
[01:22:53] of them so there's a couple of places I
[01:22:55] would love to take you to in India I
[01:22:57] told you about one of them in the car uh
[01:22:59] which is the mountains like Himalayas
[01:23:00] there too many Secrets like that's where
[01:23:02] you actually find the wisdom of the
[01:23:03] sages and you feel it in the air the
[01:23:05] other place is Banaras Varanasi yeah
[01:23:08] which is in according to sanatan it's
[01:23:11] the oldest city in the world and you do
[01:23:13] feel that it is chaotic but there's
[01:23:15] another part of it that's extremely
[01:23:16] quiet there's a part of Banaras called
[01:23:19] the manikarnika G mhm where they
[01:23:21] perpetually burn bodies for the sake of
[01:23:23] cremation MH mhm they say that when you
[01:23:25] stand at the manikara and you view the
[01:23:27] bodies burning whatever is inside you
[01:23:31] FRS up and comes on to the outside and
[01:23:35] that's where something inside you shifts
[01:23:38] so for me I just became very curious and
[01:23:40] I became more serious about this journey
[01:23:42] of podcasting I realized that this is my
[01:23:44] true iy guy um Japanese concept for the
[01:23:48] sake of curiosity because you come uh
[01:23:52] face to face with death you see human
[01:23:54] body's burning you know if if you
[01:23:56] actually view a human body burning at
[01:23:58] some point the skull
[01:24:00] explodes so when you see that happening
[01:24:03] in front of you it shifts something
[01:24:05] inside and I Feel Again India is
[01:24:07] definitely not for everyone but it is
[01:24:09] for Seekers I mean if you could keep
[01:24:11] your death in front of you at all times
[01:24:13] you would live a magical life then you
[01:24:16] would value the exact moment at it's you
[01:24:18] know as being the complete and wholesome
[01:24:22] and only real sacred thing that exist
[01:24:25] do you keep it death in front of you I
[01:24:27] try to it's not it doesn't always work
[01:24:29] but I do it's
[01:24:31] probably it's probably the most
[01:24:33] liberating thing that I do it's not I
[01:24:35] don't do it as an exercise I just but it
[01:24:37] is on my mind a lot what's an ideal
[01:24:39] death for
[01:24:41] you it doesn't matter hopefully not
[01:24:44] slowly or painfully but you know it's
[01:24:46] it's when it when it's gone it's gone I
[01:24:49] guess the ideal would be it would be
[01:24:50] good to be to have uh self-realized
[01:24:54] before for that you know ultimate
[01:24:56] truth be good I don't know if there's
[01:24:59] such a thing that's that's Enlightenment
[01:25:02] is not something you
[01:25:04] necessarily from what I can tell it's
[01:25:06] not something you necessarily find or
[01:25:07] create it's more just unlearning it's a
[01:25:09] shedding it's what remains when
[01:25:11] everything else is gone so it's it is a
[01:25:13] mini death of its own sort it is a death
[01:25:16] of the separate self in the mind um and
[01:25:19] I'm not looking for that kind of death
[01:25:20] but I would say I'm looking for truth
[01:25:22] and if that's true then I'll take the
[01:25:23] truth I'll take the truth TR I'll take
[01:25:24] an unhappy truth over a lie any day and
[01:25:26] I don't think it's an unhappy truth
[01:25:27] anyway but it doesn't matter I'm I'm
[01:25:30] open to whatever the truth is if the
[01:25:31] truth is oh I'm just a brain and a vat
[01:25:33] this is a simulation and someone's pting
[01:25:35] and poking at me and they're going to
[01:25:36] torture me for eternity fine show me the
[01:25:38] truth I'd rather know the truth you know
[01:25:40] in The Joe Rogan episode you spoke about
[01:25:42] how uh you used to meditate yeah and you
[01:25:45] would just view your own thoughts You'
[01:25:46] sit in a place and just view your own
[01:25:47] thoughts and through that process
[01:25:49] sometimes you read Stillness but you
[01:25:51] also had some psychedelic experiences do
[01:25:53] you ever think about
[01:25:55] those I kind of got bored of it um and
[01:25:59] and I and I just I don't think
[01:26:01] experiences are are the thing did the
[01:26:04] distractions yes any experience that
[01:26:06] comes will also go uh the the thing that
[01:26:09] matters is what your state of mind is
[01:26:12] you know at 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon
[01:26:14] when you're sitting by yourself how do
[01:26:15] you feel are you are you peaceful are
[01:26:17] you happy are you good you know 2:37
[01:26:20] p.m. you're walking down the street are
[01:26:21] you okay how do you feel are you good
[01:26:23] that's what matters Ms right it's the
[01:26:25] exact moment in time what is your
[01:26:27] internal State what is your external
[01:26:29] State um you know what are the thoughts
[01:26:31] that are going through your head if any
[01:26:34] that's what matters so I don't want
[01:26:37] Bliss for an hour a day uh that's just
[01:26:39] another experience that comes and goes I
[01:26:42] want I want something that's
[01:26:44] indestructible did you ever smoke
[01:26:48] weed uh you know I live in
[01:26:51] California when you were younger no no
[01:26:54] know luckily that's the kind of thing
[01:26:55] that if I discovered in my youth I don't
[01:26:57] think I would have had a very productive
[01:26:58] youth because you get too into it yeah
[01:27:01] it's it's it's it's too easy to turn off
[01:27:03] your brain I think things like weed uh
[01:27:06] you know the the West is going through a
[01:27:08] very hedonistic phase where it's all
[01:27:10] about being single and partying and
[01:27:11] doing drugs and um those are hard things
[01:27:15] to resist they can really destroy your
[01:27:18] sense of self-being uh I've definitely
[01:27:20] seen people who have done way too many
[01:27:22] even like say for example common belief
[01:27:24] now is that like mushrooms are harmless
[01:27:26] right they're not I mean you do enough
[01:27:27] of that stuff it'll break your brain
[01:27:29] you'll end up believing too many things
[01:27:31] that aren't real um you know same thing
[01:27:33] with weed it'll rob you of ambition
[01:27:35] because it's it's a very feminizing drug
[01:27:37] it's a plant estrogen so you're just
[01:27:39] going to sit there all day and smoke
[01:27:40] weed and you're not going to go do
[01:27:41] anything with your life so yes there are
[01:27:43] definitely things that I have tried but
[01:27:45] luckily I would say I'm I I'm not
[01:27:47] getting sucked into any of them fair I
[01:27:49] mean even water in excess is bad sure
[01:27:53] alth that one we're pretty well evolved
[01:27:54] for right it's just like for example if
[01:27:57] you just from an evolutionary past if
[01:28:00] You' had access to like easy weed all
[01:28:02] the time you would have gotten eaten by
[01:28:04] something right you wouldn't have made
[01:28:05] it very far um it's just in modern
[01:28:08] society yeah we can do that modern
[01:28:10] society is really weird where we we've
[01:28:13] we've changed our physical environment
[01:28:15] much faster than we're adapted for so we
[01:28:17] do need all kinds of coping mechanisms
[01:28:20] right for example we're all overfed
[01:28:22] we're UND ex exercised uh we're
[01:28:24] overstimulated uh our minds are worrying
[01:28:27] about far away things right the media
[01:28:29] the purpose of the media as I've joked
[01:28:31] before is to make every problem your
[01:28:33] problem right you go on you go on social
[01:28:35] media and it's just all dueling meme
[01:28:37] viruses each one trying to occupy a slot
[01:28:40] in your brain to Make You Care well you
[01:28:42] know thousand years ago someone could
[01:28:44] have gotten shot or blown up in some Far
[01:28:46] Away country you would have never heard
[01:28:48] about it you had no stake in it you had
[01:28:49] no way of knowing about it now it's just
[01:28:51] your brain is not man is not designed to
[01:28:54] handle all the world's emergencies in
[01:28:56] real time as they break it's breaking
[01:28:58] your brain at some deep level you're not
[01:29:01] even meant to see violence or
[01:29:02] pornography like those are very weird
[01:29:05] and rare and unique new things uh and so
[01:29:09] the modern struggle is to navigate
[01:29:11] through the fruits of
[01:29:13] abundance uh that are wrecking you right
[01:29:16] it's actually the
[01:29:18] the the challenge of modernity is
[01:29:20] avoiding the fruits of modernity right
[01:29:22] for you have to become almost a yogi in
[01:29:25] self-defense uh to protect yourself it's
[01:29:27] called ver in in our culture and it
[01:29:30] means being in the middle of a party
[01:29:32] yeah and seeing everyone party around
[01:29:33] you and being happy for them but not
[01:29:35] taking part in the party yourself other
[01:29:37] than just keeping your mind there yeah
[01:29:39] this is why I'm finding it harder and
[01:29:41] harder to go to
[01:29:42] parties because it's hard not to get
[01:29:44] involved and to indulge but it's so
[01:29:45] meaningless it's just another game right
[01:29:48] uh and they're fun and occasionally I do
[01:29:49] go to parties and I do like a good party
[01:29:51] and you have a higher odds of dragging
[01:29:52] me out to good party than to like some
[01:29:54] tedious meeting um but all that said
[01:29:57] like Even parties have kind of lost
[01:29:59] their
[01:30:00] luster what's Nal R can't like when he's
[01:30:02] drunk or
[01:30:05] high uh same but more talkative more
[01:30:09] talkative more talkative yeah because
[01:30:11] you're inherently a bit of an introvert
[01:30:13] yes yeah got yeah on a podcast I'm not
[01:30:15] but uh left to my own devices I'm very
[01:30:18] much an inter I would much rather read
[01:30:20] or be on the Internet or just be walking
[01:30:23] around thinking
[01:30:24] or you know listening to YouTube or a
[01:30:26] podcast or something than uh hanging out
[01:30:29] with people do you miss your
[01:30:32] childhood
[01:30:34] no but I don't really think about it I
[01:30:36] don't think about the past much
[01:30:38] consciously yeah they when you're asking
[01:30:40] me the question I'm being forced to
[01:30:41] think about it for the first time in a
[01:30:42] long time my bad no no there's nothing
[01:30:44] wrong with it I'm just saying I don't
[01:30:45] think about it so I don't I don't have a
[01:30:47] I don't have a predigested answer for
[01:30:49] you that's great yeah no but I would say
[01:30:51] no I don't miss my childhood I don't
[01:30:53] it's it's like a dream is it real did it
[01:30:55] actually
[01:30:57] happen wow there's a quote that goes
[01:31:00] like the past is fiction it is fiction
[01:31:02] the P the past is uh it it is a
[01:31:05] narrative you don't remember most of it
[01:31:07] the little bit that you do remember is
[01:31:08] very selective memory stitched into a
[01:31:10] narrative uh there's no point in really
[01:31:12] remembering it uh presumably there are
[01:31:14] lessons to learn but you probably
[01:31:16] already digested those and learned them
[01:31:17] you don't even have to think about those
[01:31:19] uh so what's the
[01:31:22] point um do you think about about the
[01:31:24] future at
[01:31:25] all uh I think about the future for
[01:31:28] practical things career stuff well like
[01:31:30] yeah if I have to make money or an
[01:31:32] investment or if I have to like figure
[01:31:34] out what to do with the this child and
[01:31:35] this problem and solve that or you know
[01:31:38] where do I want to have dinner so yeah
[01:31:39] and that sense we are future planners
[01:31:42] but uh I don't I don't think too far
[01:31:45] ahead I don't I don't obsess over it but
[01:31:48] I'm more of a future creature than a
[01:31:49] past creature for sure uh in an ideal
[01:31:52] world I wouldn't think that much about
[01:31:53] the future either but I'm not there I
[01:31:55] think we're forced to in order you have
[01:31:57] to I mean you're you're a functioning
[01:31:59] creature that has to navigate the world
[01:32:01] but I I I I want to think about the
[01:32:03] future as regards to utilitarian things
[01:32:07] you know food money uh you know those
[01:32:10] kinds of things problem solving I don't
[01:32:12] want to think about the future in sense
[01:32:14] of what does it hold for me like am I
[01:32:17] going to be happy am I going to be uh in
[01:32:19] a good relationship you know am I going
[01:32:21] to die like the death thing is
[01:32:24] interesting to think about you kind of
[01:32:25] can't look away it's like the most
[01:32:26] important thing that's going to happen
[01:32:27] to you right so you have to think about
[01:32:29] it but uh I I don't want to think about
[01:32:32] I don't want to self-
[01:32:33] obsess in the future the reason I don't
[01:32:37] self- obsess anymore or never even got
[01:32:40] that into it is because I just found it
[01:32:42] both a waste of time uh as well as it
[01:32:45] was just destroying my
[01:32:47] happiness happiness is a big word so
[01:32:49] more peace intruding on my peace gotcha
[01:32:52] I think we're almost at the end of the
[01:32:53] episode episode what advice do you have
[01:32:55] for me I don't have advice for you I
[01:32:58] mean you you must have gotten to know
[01:32:59] something about me at this point or
[01:33:01] maybe I'll ask you the career advice
[01:33:03] aspect because I could reframe this
[01:33:06] question as how do you view the world of
[01:33:08] content creators going into the future I
[01:33:11] would okay I'll give you some advice I
[01:33:13] like I like being provocative so uh I
[01:33:15] would say be selfish be more selfish uh
[01:33:18] make sure you really enjoy your work
[01:33:21] make sure you really are only working
[01:33:22] with the people that you really like
[01:33:23] doing like working with uh make sure you
[01:33:26] are only have the guests on that you're
[01:33:29] proud to have on that you genuinely want
[01:33:30] to have conversations with um because I
[01:33:34] I think the the value you've already
[01:33:36] built something of incredible value and
[01:33:38] it's going to continue compounding so
[01:33:41] the value now is about the longevity how
[01:33:43] long can you keep it going whether you
[01:33:44] go to episode a th000 or 2,000 or 5,000
[01:33:47] matters more than uh you know you don't
[01:33:50] want to be in grinder mode if you're
[01:33:51] just grinding you're going to burn out
[01:33:53] and the day you or not this thing is
[01:33:54] over so I would say just make sure you
[01:33:56] enjoy yourself and uh so that's part of
[01:34:00] it uh so be selfish and make sure you
[01:34:02] enjoy yourself and then the second part
[01:34:04] of being selfish is talk to people where
[01:34:07] you genuinely want to talk to them don't
[01:34:09] don't just record a podcast or record a
[01:34:11] podcast because you know you have to
[01:34:13] make certain amount of money or you got
[01:34:14] to check a box because you will be
[01:34:15] judged at the end of the day by your
[01:34:16] best work not by any by your average all
[01:34:19] my content that is out there that people
[01:34:21] like I didn't do it for them I didn't do
[01:34:23] it for anything I didn't do it for
[01:34:24] anyone I just did it for me and it was
[01:34:27] deeply selfish it was just notes to self
[01:34:30] and there's nothing wrong with that
[01:34:31] because we're all the same inside so if
[01:34:34] you if you're creating art then you do
[01:34:37] it for its own sake you do it because
[01:34:38] you enjoy it and then other people will
[01:34:40] see the same thing that you saw in it um
[01:34:45] and they'll get value out of it so I say
[01:34:47] just be selfish and you can sustain it
[01:34:49] okay now I will uh you know take the
[01:34:54] layers off I'll take the filters off and
[01:34:56] tell you that this was one of the
[01:34:58] biggest days of my podcasting career man
[01:34:59] you're very nice um you have helped me
[01:35:02] so much from a professional perspective
[01:35:04] being on the other side of the world and
[01:35:06] just speaking on other podcasts and
[01:35:08] there's so many people like me who just
[01:35:10] sit in different parts of this globe and
[01:35:13] consume pieces of Your Mind through
[01:35:15] Twitter through the stuff you say on
[01:35:17] podcast and I know you're very
[01:35:19] nonchalant about it like you're just
[01:35:20] enjoying it but you're adding so much
[01:35:23] value to our lives and so many of us
[01:35:25] have daddy issues and mommy issues and I
[01:35:27] think Nal ravikant has become kind of a
[01:35:29] big brother figure to people all over
[01:35:32] the globe and to just be able to share
[01:35:34] screen space with you is one of the
[01:35:35] biggest honors of my life yeah at the
[01:35:37] same time the worst thing I could do for
[01:35:38] myself is is get into the idea of having
[01:35:41] a fan base because uh Fame is a beast
[01:35:44] it'll lead you alive and I don't want to
[01:35:46] do anything for other people I don't
[01:35:49] care about if they respect me or not
[01:35:51] disrespect all day long who cares sh I
[01:35:54] mean I hear you uh and you know just
[01:35:57] observing you go about how you handle F
[01:35:59] we were together at an event right now
[01:36:02] it it's taught me a lot uh just sharing
[01:36:05] I don't think I handle it well you know
[01:36:06] I get approached by a lot of people they
[01:36:07] want to take a photo it always kind of
[01:36:08] weirds me out a little bit uh no it's
[01:36:11] just it'd be better not to be famous to
[01:36:13] be honest if I had to do it over again
[01:36:14] it might be better to be
[01:36:17] anonymous thank God you're not
[01:36:19] Anonymous but Nal genuinely from the
[01:36:22] bottom of my heart I bow down to you no
[01:36:24] don't bows please that's embarrassing PE
[01:36:26] relationships only I I hear you but no
[01:36:28] bows no gurus anybody calls me you want
[01:36:30] to not be my friend call me a guru not
[01:36:32] going to be friends I I don't think
[01:36:33] you're a guru but you are a bit of a b
[01:36:37] you know what bayya means brother yeah
[01:36:38] big brother yeah so that's what I look
[01:36:40] at you as and that's how a lot of brown
[01:36:42] people look at you as we're all brothers
[01:36:44] that works there's some people who just
[01:36:46] emit that Sensei energy and it's not
[01:36:48] their will again it's the universe
[01:36:50] working through you that's how I look at
[01:36:52] you so thank you for everything you've
[01:36:54] given all of us you're guiding a lot of
[01:36:55] young people and you're helping everyone
[01:36:58] with the mental and spiritual health
[01:37:00] without knowing it thank you you're very
[01:37:01] kind as are you 800 episodes and you're
[01:37:04] obviously seeking bigger and bigger
[01:37:06] truths so you're on a good path thank
[01:37:08] you thank Youk you uh I hope we get to
[01:37:10] speak again in life and I hope you had a
[01:37:13] very nice time to me thank you I did
[01:37:15] thanks for having me that was the
[01:37:18] episode uh was not easy to make this
[01:37:21] particular episode happen I had to to
[01:37:23] fly to Singapore which is a 5-hour
[01:37:25] flight away from Mumbai of course Nal
[01:37:28] flew from halfway across the world uh
[01:37:30] our common friend Balaji told me uh that
[01:37:34] there is this opportunity and nal's
[01:37:36] agreed to do this particular episode so
[01:37:38] this was the first ever episode we shot
[01:37:42] on foreign soil in my eyes it's the
[01:37:45] first International episode on TRS even
[01:37:47] though we've shot one with Arnold
[01:37:48] schweger in Korea we've shot an episode
[01:37:51] with Ronnie Coleman in India we've shot
[01:37:53] episode with Braun strowman in India
[01:37:55] countless foreign cricketers but I truly
[01:37:59] feel like my International phase of this
[01:38:02] podcasting Journey Begins with this very
[01:38:04] important and very iconic episode of the
[01:38:07] ranir show couldn't sleep on the night
[01:38:10] of this episode because this was a very
[01:38:11] important life moment for me it's
[01:38:13] something I've visualized for a very
[01:38:14] long time before we executed upon this
[01:38:17] podcast uh dream come true for anyone
[01:38:20] who's been listening to podcasts for the
[01:38:22] last decade
[01:38:24] we all know what a big deal naal
[01:38:26] ravikant is I'm just glad I got to do
[01:38:28] this very easygoing conversation with
[01:38:30] him and I hope that he returns on the
