In this mini-course youâ€™ll learn everything you need to start creating converting landing pages and website headers. Then go practice on our platform with over 30 different, guided landing pages. 

Web design is the most important skill in UX design because not every company even needs a mobile app at this point. But every company does need a website. 

Learn the right skills, don't waste time! 

PS. This is an introduction to landing pages - obviously truly great landing pages take more time than 10 minutes to make - but I did this one in 10 minutes to show you a starting point. Be aware of that - learn that, and then you'll have the skills to tweak the design to be even better. Yes - it can be better.

And don't forget to research and test it after launch, as the whole idea is to iterate on it and make it perform as best as it can! 

Let's go!

[00:00:00] people are naturally going to notice
[00:00:02] that button a lot more I'll also show
[00:00:04] you how to get from this to
[00:00:08] [Music]
[00:00:10] this people aren't really completely
[00:00:13] sure what a good landing page is many
[00:00:16] think that a great landing page is a lot
[00:00:19] of animations and crazy transition and
[00:00:21] scroll hijacking because this is what
[00:00:24] social media tells you but this is not
[00:00:26] the truth so you spend all that time
[00:00:29] learning all that and then it turns
[00:00:32] out it's completely useless a good
[00:00:35] example is the linear website which used
[00:00:38] to be copied by almost everybody back in
[00:00:41] the day and then they realized that all
[00:00:44] the animations Transitions and extra
[00:00:46] things just don't contribute to
[00:00:49] conversion which is the most important
[00:00:51] thing about landing page so they dialed
[00:00:54] it back this is how it looked like
[00:00:57] before and this is how it looks like now
[00:01:01] it's still beautiful it's still welld
[00:01:02] designed but it's way more minimal the
[00:01:05] idea behind the landing page is to get
[00:01:08] as many people as possible to perform a
[00:01:11] specific action like clicking a button
[00:01:13] or buying a product and most designers
[00:01:16] have no idea how to make great landing
[00:01:18] pages except for maybe following a
[00:01:21] tutorial with smart anime to create some
[00:01:24] crazy header transitions that's not the
[00:01:26] way today's video is just the starting
[00:01:29] point for you it's a necessary one but
[00:01:32] it's just a tip of the iceberg let me
[00:01:34] know in the comments if you want me to
[00:01:36] do more videos on landing pages on the
[00:01:39] channel this year I have a better way
[00:01:42] and I'm going to show you a very quick
[00:01:44] tutorial on how I use mid journey to
[00:01:46] generate some assets and then put
[00:01:48] together a landing page header because
[00:01:50] most landing page headers follow a
[00:01:53] formula that formula requires a little
[00:01:56] bit of text that's going to tell you why
[00:01:59] you should eat even click the button an
[00:02:01] action button which is the most
[00:02:03] important part and a key visual that
[00:02:05] will enforce the message it can have a
[00:02:08] logo and some navigation up top as well
[00:02:11] so let's quickly typ frame it for a
[00:02:13] fictional brand I created a quick logo
[00:02:15] some menu navigation and then for the
[00:02:18] kicker we're going to add a little bit
[00:02:20] of text that leads to the main slogun
[00:02:22] the main slogun is going to be the best
[00:02:24] yellow hoodies ever and then there is a
[00:02:27] little bit of extra context underneath
[00:02:29] that and a button and then we'll reserve
[00:02:32] the space on the right side for our key
[00:02:34] Visual and right after this I'm going to
[00:02:36] show you the ey tracking conversion
[00:02:39] trick then you can look into some stock
[00:02:42] photo sites or create some Custom
[00:02:44] Graphics but since we're doing yellow
[00:02:45] hoodies I'm going to type that into mid
[00:02:48] Journey The Prompt is going to be in the
[00:02:50] description and then after a while we
[00:02:52] come up with a couple of options so I'm
[00:02:54] going to pick one paste it to pixelmator
[00:02:57] Pro and then remove the background then
[00:02:59] I can copy it into my Vector editing
[00:03:01] tool we already have some stuff in there
[00:03:04] based on the type frame so first thing
[00:03:06] I'm doing I'm pasting the image and then
[00:03:08] changing the color of the button to
[00:03:10] match the shirt then let's modify the
[00:03:12] text on the button and the arrow to be
[00:03:15] darker so it's going to be visible on
[00:03:17] that background and now we also need to
[00:03:20] tweak the copy a little bit and group
[00:03:23] The Arrow to group them together with
[00:03:25] the text we can also use our primary
[00:03:27] color to highlight one of the words in
[00:03:30] this casee the word yellow because
[00:03:33] obviously and make this whole copy part
[00:03:35] a little bit interesting and more
[00:03:37] eye-catching now it's time for the
[00:03:40] masking so I'm going to create a rounded
[00:03:42] rectangle mask the character with it and
[00:03:46] it cuts off his head so what you do is
[00:03:48] you make a copy of this entire photo
[00:03:50] outside of the mask and then just crop
[00:03:53] the top part of the head which is the
[00:03:55] hair in this case so it can stick out of
[00:03:57] that little rectangle mask now there are
[00:04:00] multiple ways to do this there can be
[00:04:03] completely different key visuals there
[00:04:05] can be background photos there can be
[00:04:08] animations and we're going to get to all
[00:04:11] that but remember that the landing page
[00:04:13] is all about the stuff on the left side
[00:04:16] the button and the copy and that's going
[00:04:18] to be Universal throughout all the
[00:04:20] landing pages that we're going to go
[00:04:21] through today now let's talk about some
[00:04:24] landing page elements and psychology and
[00:04:26] then I'll show you at the end of the
[00:04:28] video how to trans for this landing page
[00:04:30] to be even
[00:04:32] better and one cool way for a key visual
[00:04:36] is to use people but you need to use
[00:04:38] them in you know what a smart way and
[00:04:40] the smart way is not just cramming some
[00:04:43] people into the header it needs to make
[00:04:45] sense for it to make sense you need to
[00:04:48] understand one thing see what happens
[00:04:50] when I look here to my left you
[00:04:53] naturally follow my gaze you look that
[00:04:56] way you want to see what's there now use
[00:04:58] that to your advant AG pick a character
[00:05:01] that's looking right at your call to
[00:05:04] action button and smiling maybe and then
[00:05:08] people are naturally going to notice
[00:05:10] that button a lot more but of course
[00:05:12] there is more about landing pages that
[00:05:14] you should know one thing is that not
[00:05:18] every business needs a mobile app
[00:05:20] because they're expensive to code and
[00:05:22] they're not really that useful for most
[00:05:24] companies but every business needs some
[00:05:27] sort of a landing page and sadly people
[00:05:31] don't know how to make them so we
[00:05:33] decided to do something about it I did
[00:05:35] something about it a few years ago now
[00:05:38] with my landing page course which has
[00:05:41] helped thousands of people to get better
[00:05:43] at landing pages and you can get it
[00:05:45] cheaper in the description below but
[00:05:48] that's not all because whether you
[00:05:50] finished that course and that's good for
[00:05:52] you or not now you can go on our
[00:05:55] platform and participate in a special
[00:05:58] Pro user only 30-day landing page design
[00:06:01] challenge we give you 30 different
[00:06:04] landing page headers to design and to
[00:06:06] get full guides and explanations and
[00:06:09] information on how to best approach it
[00:06:12] you can either do it completely your way
[00:06:15] just use ours as inspiration or what we
[00:06:18] recommend for beginners you can just
[00:06:21] copy them one to one and then in V2
[00:06:23] after 10 days you can try changing
[00:06:26] things up this kind of copying directly
[00:06:29] trying to recreate something exactly as
[00:06:31] it was is one of the best ways to learn
[00:06:33] if you're just starting if you're more
[00:06:35] confident just try changing things and
[00:06:38] making it your own right away at the end
[00:06:40] of this challenge you will have 30
[00:06:43] unique landing page headers this for a
[00:06:46] portfolio especially if you're
[00:06:48] freelancing is invaluable because what
[00:06:50] you can also do is use those headers for
[00:06:53] your own professional landing pages you
[00:06:55] can tweak them a little bit and then
[00:06:57] sell them to a client
[00:07:00] okay now let's make this better we
[00:07:02] already established that just adding
[00:07:04] random dancing people in yellow hoodies
[00:07:07] is not going to work because that
[00:07:08] creates vertical chaos and our Focus
[00:07:11] just goes up and down and really away
[00:07:13] from the btom let's use the Gaze
[00:07:15] following principle to position our main
[00:07:18] key visual hero person in a way that
[00:07:21] he's looking at the button or at the
[00:07:23] slogun so we end up with this initial
[00:07:26] version now let's make it better
[00:07:30] if your product is high rated it's
[00:07:33] really good to add the five-star rating
[00:07:35] instead of the kicker you can write
[00:07:37] something like best in class or best
[00:07:39] reviewed and that gives that extra
[00:07:42] context next to the slogun that confirms
[00:07:44] that it's the best yellow hoodies for
[00:07:46] designers then I changed the copy at the
[00:07:49] bottom to say you can charge your
[00:07:51] clients double because this is the main
[00:07:54] incentive that kind of happens right
[00:07:56] before the CTA button this is what gets
[00:08:00] people interested in clicking the button
[00:08:02] instead of one single pill with the
[00:08:05] character we now have three and what
[00:08:07] many people do is add a lot more people
[00:08:11] in there but if you want to keep it
[00:08:13] minimal and simpler it's actually best
[00:08:16] to show more of the product unless you
[00:08:18] sell completely different products that
[00:08:20] way you can just show different people
[00:08:22] wearing them for example but in this
[00:08:24] case since it's just yellow hoodies
[00:08:27] let's show the material let's show that
[00:08:28] it's org IC cotton and we can add a
[00:08:31] little bit of overlays but really small
[00:08:34] ones as decorations and the final thing
[00:08:37] is following the arrow from the
[00:08:39] character it's looking at the slogun
[00:08:42] right towards our main CTA button I also
[00:08:45] added a simple background behind
[00:08:47] everything to make it sit in space a
[00:08:51] little bit more but that's not
[00:08:53] necessary now you can use tools like hot
[00:08:55] jar or be usable to test your coded
[00:08:58] landing page to see see how many people
[00:09:00] click the button and then adjust tweak
[00:09:03] and modify because a good landing page
[00:09:05] is never done and it's truly based on
[00:09:09] Research so focus on the skills that
[00:09:12] actually matter of course the better way
[00:09:14] to starting this is to taking my web
[00:09:17] design courses first and then going into
[00:09:19] the challenge but if you don't have the
[00:09:21] courses and you just want to go straight
[00:09:23] away into the daily work do that as well
[00:09:27] also since it's a pro challenge
[00:09:28] everybody gets feedback every single day
[00:09:31] on this Challenge and our AI bought is
[00:09:33] giving you feedback within minutes of
[00:09:35] posting so the idea is that we should
[00:09:38] start making some really useful things
[00:09:40] in the industry not focusing on mobile
[00:09:42] apps that almost nobody needs and they
[00:09:45] don't hire Junior people to make mobile
[00:09:48] apps in companies anyway but they do
[00:09:50] hire Junior people to make landing pages
[00:09:53] and a lot of them so learn landing pages
[00:09:55] all right oh yeah and all the links are
[00:09:59] obviously in the description and that
[00:10:02] way we're both going to have a beautiful
[00:10:04] day
