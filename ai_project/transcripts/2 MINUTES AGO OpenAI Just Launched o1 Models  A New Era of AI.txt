[00:00:00] holy open AI just did it again
[00:00:02] they've launched something that could
[00:00:04] change the AI game completely we're
[00:00:06] talking about the new1 family of models
[00:00:09] and they're already claiming PhD level
[00:00:11] intelligence in areas like physics
[00:00:13] mathematics and coding this isn't a
[00:00:16] small upgrade this is a leap that could
[00:00:18] redefine how AI is applied across
[00:00:21] Industries let's break it all down and
[00:00:24] see why 01 preview and 01 mini could be
[00:00:27] the most significant advancement since
[00:00:29] GPT 4 especially for those looking to
[00:00:31] solve problems previously too complex
[00:00:34] for AI to truly understand why this
[00:00:36] launch is Monumental we need to look at
[00:00:39] the broader context of AI development
[00:00:41] we've already seen the GPT series
[00:00:43] revolutionize text generation question
[00:00:46] answering and general problem solving
[00:00:49] but 01 takes this a step further unlike
[00:00:51] its predecessors 01 isn't just a
[00:00:54] multi-purpose tool it's designed to
[00:00:56] tackle specialized tasks with a depth of
[00:00:59] reasoning that was once exclusive to
[00:01:01] human experts in many ways this new
[00:01:03] model family has the potential to
[00:01:05] surpass human capabilities in certain
[00:01:08] domains especially when it comes to
[00:01:10] multi-step reasoning and deep analysis
[00:01:13] so what exactly sets the 01 models apart
[00:01:17] well for starters open AI didn't just
[00:01:20] design them to create better text
[00:01:21] responses these models were built to
[00:01:24] excel in academic Fields like advanced
[00:01:26] mathematics quantum physics and complex
[00:01:29] coding tasks think of it like this where
[00:01:32] gp4 is an allrounder 01 is the brain
[00:01:35] surgeon it's precise powerful and built
[00:01:39] for the most intricate challenges let's
[00:01:41] take a moment to appreciate just how
[00:01:43] massive this leap is in tests like the
[00:01:46] international mathematics Olympiad or
[00:01:48] IMO where only the sharpest human Minds
[00:01:51] compete 01 preview solved a staggering
[00:01:54] 83% of the problems a massive
[00:01:57] improvement over GPT 40 which could only
[00:02:00] manage 133% this isn't just an
[00:02:03] incremental upgrade it's a paradigm
[00:02:05] shift in how we use AI to solve complex
[00:02:08] problems imagine AI helping to unravel
[00:02:11] some of the most challenging scientific
[00:02:13] puzzles from decoding genetic sequences
[00:02:16] in genomics to untangling the intricate
[00:02:18] laws of quantum mechanics but what does
[00:02:21] PHD level AI really mean for the
[00:02:23] everyday World Picture This in physics a
[00:02:27] researcher studying Quantum Optics could
[00:02:29] spend years developing the right
[00:02:31] equations to test the theory but with 01
[00:02:34] preview that process could be cut down
[00:02:36] to months or even weeks it's not just
[00:02:39] about speed it's about accuracy and the
[00:02:42] ability to think critically through
[00:02:44] problems that were once considered too
[00:02:46] complex for any machine this model can
[00:02:49] simulate hundreds of scenarios refine
[00:02:52] hypotheses and generate solutions that
[00:02:54] allow humans to focus on testing and
[00:02:57] validating instead of crunching numbers
[00:03:00] and the breakthroughs don't stop there
[00:03:02] 01 mini which is 80% cheaper than its
[00:03:05] more powerful sibling can still handle
[00:03:08] highly complex tasks especially in
[00:03:10] fields like coding in fact in coding
[00:03:13] competitions like code forces it ranked
[00:03:15] in the 89th percentile that's among the
[00:03:18] world's best programmers this means that
[00:03:21] for companies or developers working on
[00:03:23] Mission critical applications 01 isn't
[00:03:26] just a luxury it's a necessity take
[00:03:29] coding for instance when developers face
[00:03:32] multi-step workflows like debugging
[00:03:34] intricate systems or integrating new
[00:03:37] features across multiple platforms these
[00:03:40] models offer an unparalleled Advantage
[00:03:43] 01 preview doesn't just help by
[00:03:45] providing Snippets of code it walks you
[00:03:48] through the entire process debugging
[00:03:51] refining optimizing all in one go this
[00:03:54] kind of capability is a game changer for
[00:03:57] software development teams who are under
[00:03:59] pressure to deliver quickly and with
[00:04:01] Precision but coding is just one part of
[00:04:04] the story imagine what this technology
[00:04:07] could do in Healthcare doctors and
[00:04:09] researchers regularly face the challenge
[00:04:11] of analyzing enormous data sets whether
[00:04:14] it's to identify patterns in medical
[00:04:16] images or to process thousands of
[00:04:18] sequences in genomics AI models like 01
[00:04:22] can crunch through this data at
[00:04:24] lightning speed uncovering insights that
[00:04:26] could help doctors diagnose diseases
[00:04:28] faster or or even predict health risks
[00:04:31] before they become serious problems for
[00:04:34] example AI could analyze a patient's
[00:04:36] genetic code to determine
[00:04:38] predispositions for diseases like cancer
[00:04:41] or Alzheimer's giving Health Care
[00:04:43] Providers the information they need to
[00:04:45] personalized treatments like never
[00:04:47] before the applications in scientific
[00:04:50] research are even more astounding
[00:04:52] whether it's understanding complex

[00:05:10] improve their accuracy by considering
[00:05:12] multi-step calculations and testing
[00:05:15] multiple hypotheses
[00:05:17] simultaneously researchers who typically
[00:05:20] spend years analyzing complex data could
[00:05:22] now accomplish their work in a fraction
[00:05:24] of the time leading to faster
[00:05:26] breakthroughs in renewable energy drug
[00:05:29] discovery and Material Sciences and
[00:05:32] let's not forget the financial sector
[00:05:34] with its Advanced reasoning and data
[00:05:37] processing capabilities 01 preview could
[00:05:40] revolutionize the way Banks and
[00:05:42] investment firms assess risks predict
[00:05:44] market trends and make informed
[00:05:46] decisions in a field where milliseconds
[00:05:49] matter this AI model could mean the
[00:05:52] difference between success and disaster
[00:05:54] in high frequency trading imagine
[00:05:57] analyzing billions of Market data points
[00:05:59] in real time sporting trends that even
[00:06:02] human analysts might miss o1 preview can
[00:06:05] do just that now while all of this
[00:06:08] sounds groundbreaking it's important to
[00:06:10] acknowledge the limitations of these
[00:06:12] models at least for now the 01 models
[00:06:15] are still restricted to text based tasks
[00:06:18] which means they can't yet generate
[00:06:20] images or browse the web in real time
[00:06:23] for creators who rely on AI for visual
[00:06:25] content or those needing real-time data
[00:06:28] gp4 Remains the more versatile option
[00:06:32] however open AI has made it clear that
[00:06:34] future updates will bring these
[00:06:36] capabilities to the 01 family making
[00:06:39] them even more powerful and adaptable of
[00:06:42] course there's also the matter of usage
[00:06:44] caps right now access to 01 preview is
[00:06:47] limited to 30 messages per week which
[00:06:50] may be frustrating for users needing
[00:06:52] constant access this could be
[00:06:54] particularly challenging for researchers
[00:06:57] or developers working on long-term
[00:06:59] projects where consistent interaction
[00:07:01] with the AI is crucial but as open AI
[00:07:04] continues to refine and expand these
[00:07:06] models we can expect more generous usage
[00:07:09] limits in the future that brings us to
[00:07:11] one of the most critical aspects of the
[00:07:13] 01 models Safety and Security with AI
[00:07:17] becoming more embedded in our lives the
[00:07:19] risks of generating harmful content or
[00:07:22] being manipulated for malicious purposes
[00:07:24] are real open AI has introduced new
[00:07:28] safety training techniques to ensure
[00:07:30] that these models are aligned with
[00:07:31] ethical guidelines in rigorous
[00:07:33] jailbreaking tests where the model is
[00:07:36] tested to see if it can be manipulated
[00:07:38] into producing harmful content 01
[00:07:41] preview scored 84 out of 100 showing a
[00:07:44] vast improvement over earlier models and
[00:07:47] where do we go from here open AI is
[00:07:50] already planning to add browsing file
[00:07:52] uploads and image generation to the 01
[00:07:55] models making them an even more
[00:07:57] formidable tool for Industries like the
[00:07:59] design content creation and data
[00:08:02] analysis imagine being able to pull
[00:08:04] realtime data from the web or generate
[00:08:07] high quality images all through the same
[00:08:09] AI model that's solving Advanced
[00:08:11] mathematical problems with these
[00:08:13] advancements the 01 family is carving
[00:08:16] out a space in AI history one that goes
[00:08:19] far beyond what we've seen with GPT 4
[00:08:22] it's no longer just about generating
[00:08:23] text or answering questions it's about
[00:08:26] solving the world's most complex
[00:08:28] problems where whether it's in
[00:08:29] healthcare science Finance or coding the
[00:08:33] 01 models are pushing the boundaries of
[00:08:36] what AI can achieve
