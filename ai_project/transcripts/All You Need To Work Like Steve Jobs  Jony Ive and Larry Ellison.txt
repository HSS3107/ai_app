[00:00:04] steve was the most
[00:00:06] remarkably focused person i've ever met
[00:00:08] in my life
[00:00:10] and
[00:00:10] the thing with focus is it's not sort of
[00:00:13] like this thing you aspire to or you
[00:00:14] just you decide on monday you know what
[00:00:17] i'm going to be focused
[00:00:19] it is a every minute a why are we
[00:00:23] talking about this this is what we're
[00:00:25] working on
[00:00:26] you can achieve so much when you truly
[00:00:28] focus and one of the things that steve
[00:00:31] would say
[00:00:32] because i think he was concerned that i
[00:00:34] wasn't
[00:00:37] he would say
[00:00:38] how many things have you said no to
[00:00:41] and i would honestly i would have these
[00:00:43] sacrificial things because i mean i'm
[00:00:46] wanting to be very honest about it and
[00:00:48] so i say oh i said no to this
[00:00:51] and no to that
[00:00:53] and um
[00:00:54] he but he he knew
[00:00:56] that i wasn't vaguely interested in
[00:00:58] doing those things anyway
[00:01:00] so there was no real sacrifice what
[00:01:02] focus means is saying no to something
[00:01:05] that you with every bone in your body
[00:01:08] you think is a phenomenal idea
[00:01:11] and you wake up thinking about it
[00:01:13] but you say no to it because you're
[00:01:16] focusing on something else
[00:01:21] he had
[00:01:24] a single-mindedness and an attention to
[00:01:26] detail
[00:01:27] unlike
[00:01:28] anyone i've ever seen he wanted to
[00:01:31] engineer every aspect
[00:01:33] of the user experience let's say for the
[00:01:36] iphone
[00:01:37] including
[00:01:38] what happened when you walked into the
[00:01:39] store
[00:01:41] how you paid for it yeah uh uh uh or how
[00:01:44] you paid for an ipad with your uh i
[00:01:46] looked you saw it in the store you know
[00:01:48] obviously bought it from att uh going uh
[00:01:51] how you paid for an apple product with
[00:01:53] your credit card in the store
[00:01:55] uh
[00:01:56] how uh if if the iphone was sent to you
[00:01:59] or the iphone was delivered to your ipod
[00:02:00] delivered to what it looked like in the
[00:02:02] box the detail of the box was like to
[00:02:04] open the box what what you saw when you
[00:02:06] first opened the box how you bought an
[00:02:08] application how you um how you connected
[00:02:12] to the network i mean every excruciating
[00:02:15] detail
[00:02:16] he was personally involved in i don't
[00:02:18] think people really understand you know
[00:02:20] edison had this comment you know it's
[00:02:21] one percent inspiration
[00:02:23] and 99 perspiration
[00:02:26] steve was a god of perspiration i mean
[00:02:28] steve worked incredibly hard
[00:02:31] it wasn't just his intellectual gifts
[00:02:33] which were enormous
[00:02:35] but how he took that horsepower
[00:02:38] and applied it
[00:02:40] tirelessly
[00:02:42] until the entire problem was solved i've
[00:02:44] never seen anyone like that
[00:02:51] he would just not let go of a problem
[00:02:52] that was solved i guess that's the best
[00:02:54] way to describe it
[00:02:55] it's not that he just put in the area if
[00:02:57] he had to stay up all night if he said
[00:02:58] night after night every night i would
[00:03:00] get he would call me up and say larry
[00:03:02] let's get together we saw each other a
[00:03:04] lot and i'd come over to my house i'd go
[00:03:06] over to his house i said see i'm not
[00:03:07] coming over
[00:03:09] if you make me watch toy story again
[00:03:12] i've watched 73 different versions of
[00:03:14] toy story now i know the new version of
[00:03:15] render man is four percent better than
[00:03:18] the one i saw last week but i'm not
[00:03:20] watching this thing again so larry you
[00:03:21] got to see you you won't believe the
[00:03:23] shout the different the shadows look
[00:03:26] i don't care
[00:03:28] you don't understand i'm not coming
[00:03:31] unless you promise me that i don't
[00:03:33] you're not going to make me watch it i i
[00:03:35] promise but just a little of it
[00:03:36] [Laughter]
[00:03:39] this is before the movie came out
[00:03:41] before the movie came out
[00:03:42] and
[00:03:43] and that was that was steve and i we go
[00:03:46] over there and we go he'd have to mock
[00:03:48] up at this of the apple stores and we go
[00:03:49] over to the warehouse and is it and
[00:03:51] oracle did the software for by the way
[00:03:53] for the output for the retail software
[00:03:54] and he's just complaining about it to me
[00:03:57] steve it's sunday you're you're you're
[00:03:59] you know you're saying how terrible the
[00:04:01] oracle is off where is the juggernaut
[00:04:02] i'm your stupid store in the warehouse
[00:04:04] let me tell you i mean how many times
[00:04:05] i've come around sunday and we're
[00:04:07] walking through the checkout of
[00:04:10] you know
[00:04:11] you know
[00:04:12] but that was steve until it was perfect
[00:04:16] and then once it was perfect
[00:04:20] and then he moved on to the next problem
[00:04:23] but
[00:04:25] working working obsessively
[00:04:28] until he had a solution
[00:04:30] that was insanely great
[00:04:32] is what steve was all about
[00:04:34] and
[00:04:35] an idea i'll go back to the network
[00:04:38] computer you know we had this idea you
[00:04:39] know i had this idea simple device
[00:04:42] attached to the internet
[00:04:43] uh i'm now done
[00:04:45] you know that the you know idea idea now
[00:04:48] fully formed
[00:04:51] you know
[00:04:53] boy that was a good idea what do you
[00:04:54] think steve this is a good idea building
[00:04:56] that thing is really hard let me tell
[00:04:57] you what you have to do a b is you know
[00:04:58] and then steve then proceeds you know to
[00:05:01] come to build the ipad there's a big
[00:05:02] difference there's a reason ideas
[00:05:05] good id there are a lot of good ideas
[00:05:07] there are a lot of good ideas there are
[00:05:09] a lot of good ideas
[00:05:11] translating a good idea
[00:05:14] into a great product
[00:05:16] is
[00:05:17] unbelievably hard
[00:05:20] there are so many details people accuse
[00:05:22] steve of stealing you know the macintosh
[00:05:24] from xerox you know with the alto
[00:05:26] computer i was at xerox park so i used
[00:05:28] the alto a lot
[00:05:29] finishing the alto
[00:05:31] and turning that into the macintosh
[00:05:34] was enormously complicated and you there
[00:05:37] were so many things that had to be done
[00:05:39] that xerox had not done there were a few
[00:05:41] good ideas in uh in the xerox machine
[00:05:44] but steve would translate good ideas not
[00:05:47] always his good ideas
[00:05:49] but he would translate good ideas
[00:05:51] into finnish product
[00:05:53] unlike anyone in our industry you'd have
[00:05:55] to i mean henry ford didn't invent the
[00:05:57] car
[00:05:58] but he made it cheap and he made it
[00:05:59] popular and he made it accessible to the
[00:06:01] american people steve would translate
[00:06:03] good ideas into finished
[00:06:06] brilliant products
[00:06:10] i've had discussions with steve and
[00:06:12] steve's dean steven meetings where he
[00:06:14] didn't agree in the beginning and he was
[00:06:16] persuaded and he
[00:06:18] and when he changes he changes like that
[00:06:20] boom this is what tim cook was saying
[00:06:22] yeah and hey bang i mean he'll just move
[00:06:23] over to the best idea what he wants is
[00:06:25] the best idea the best product the best
[00:06:27] movie the best store the best you know
[00:06:29] the best everything and if he thinks
[00:06:31] someone's better than he is in
[00:06:33] a certain area he'll i mean he's very
[00:06:35] good at listening
[00:06:37] uh if he thinks uh you're full of it
[00:06:41] he'll tell you
[00:06:42] [Music]
[00:06:46] if there's an unsolved problem and
[00:06:48] you're at work can you think about
[00:06:49] anything else
[00:06:52] so if you want to know if you're like
[00:06:54] steve jobs
[00:06:55] if you are unable to think about
[00:06:57] anything
[00:06:58] about this problem
[00:07:00] so if you want to go to the movies yeah
[00:07:02] and it has nothing to do with being
[00:07:03] successful you're not thinking about oh
[00:07:05] my god if i'm steve jobs i can go out
[00:07:06] with this person i can date this person
[00:07:08] and i could buy this house and if you
[00:07:10] think about the benefits of being famous
[00:07:12] and rich
[00:07:13] then you're missing the whole point if
[00:07:14] you want to know you're like steve jobs
[00:07:16] it's very simple
[00:07:18] you are unable to think about anything
[00:07:20] about the these serious problems at work
[00:07:23] and you just that's all you can do and
[00:07:24] you obsess about it until you solve it
[00:07:26] and then you move on to the next thing
[00:07:28] and you obsess about that until you
[00:07:29] solve it and then you obsess about this
[00:07:31] until you solve it uh
[00:07:34] it is
[00:07:35] you know that obsessive compulsive
[00:07:37] personality
[00:07:39] uh combined with this incredibly
[00:07:41] and obsessive compulsive personalities
[00:07:43] are not all that rare amongst successful
[00:07:45] people
[00:07:46] the excessive compulsive personality
[00:07:48] combined with this
[00:07:49] peculiar genius of steve's which was
[00:07:53] both
[00:07:53] aesthetic you know we talked about the
[00:07:54] building you know he loved architecture
[00:07:56] and design you know he loved i mean i
[00:07:59] mean he was an amateur architect he
[00:08:02] loved product design he wasn't an
[00:08:04] engineer though he wasn't a coder he
[00:08:06] wasn't he wasn't a programmer you know
[00:08:08] and i'm you know i'm a programmer and
[00:08:11] and
[00:08:12] but he had enough knowledge
[00:08:16] of
[00:08:16] of what went into you know
[00:08:19] you know what went into the into the
[00:08:21] product whether it was uh the
[00:08:24] microprocessor or the operating system
[00:08:26] he had a pretty deep knowledge about all
[00:08:28] of that technology very smart boy he
[00:08:30] learned very fast might have not might
[00:08:32] not have been a professional programmer
[00:08:34] but
[00:08:35] his understanding of the complete system
[00:08:37] the gestalt the whole thing the whole
[00:08:40] system and how to fit those pieces
[00:08:42] together
[00:08:43] i mean he would take this this puzzle
[00:08:46] and assemble these pieces into
[00:08:49] the ipad and that's a lot of complicated
[00:08:51] software pieces and he'd work with the
[00:08:53] engineers and he was a great editor he
[00:08:55] was a wonderful editor at least you know
[00:08:57] in terms of editing the software and
[00:08:59] user interface as it was developed now
[00:09:01] he was a great editor of process in the
[00:09:03] stores he would constantly review things
[00:09:06] in continuously make them better until
[00:09:10] he was marginally satisfied and then
[00:09:12] they could release the product if you
[00:09:14] have that kind of obsession combined
[00:09:16] combined with picasso's aesthetic
[00:09:20] and edison's inventiveness
[00:09:22] then you were the next steve jobs
[00:09:25] apple became the most
[00:09:27] valuable company on earth and it wasn't
[00:09:29] even one of steve's goals
[00:09:32] he never you know
[00:09:34] he wasn't trying to be rich
[00:09:36] he wasn't trying to be famous
[00:09:38] he wasn't trying to be powerful
[00:09:41] he was
[00:09:43] obsessed
[00:09:45] with the
[00:09:46] creative process
[00:09:49] and building something that was
[00:09:51] beautiful
