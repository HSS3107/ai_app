[00:00:00] if you want to learn how to use PG admin
[00:00:02] or get better at using it this is the
[00:00:04] video for you
[00:00:05] here you'll learn how to download PG
[00:00:08] admin connect to a postgres database
[00:00:10] learn what's in the user interface run
[00:00:12] some SQL statements save files browse
[00:00:15] objects and much more
[00:00:17] if you want to follow along with this
[00:00:19] video you'll need to be able to access a
[00:00:21] postgres database
[00:00:23] this could be on your computer in the
[00:00:25] cloud or a server at work
[00:00:27] I'll have separate videos for setting
[00:00:29] this up on my channel if you want to
[00:00:30] know more
[00:00:31] let's get started with PG admin
[00:00:34] we'll start with downloading PG admin
[00:00:36] open your browser and navigate to PG
[00:00:39] admin.org
[00:00:40] click on the download button on the left
[00:00:42] of the screen
[00:00:44] PG admin is a free IDE and is available
[00:00:46] on many operating systems
[00:00:49] click on the button for your operating
[00:00:50] system on this page
[00:00:52] I'm on a Mac so I'll click on Mac OS the
[00:00:56] next page shows a list of recent
[00:00:57] versions
[00:00:58] click on the top entry here which at the
[00:01:01] time of recording is 6.14
[00:01:04] you'll then be taken to a filed browser
[00:01:06] page like this
[00:01:08] click on the DMG file here if you're on
[00:01:10] a Mac
[00:01:11] if you've selected Windows you'll see an
[00:01:13] exe file instead
[00:01:16] this file is the installation of file
[00:01:18] for PG admin
[00:01:20] save the file to your computer
[00:01:22] it's a couple of hundred megabytes so
[00:01:24] should take a minute or so to download
[00:01:25] depending on your speed
[00:01:28] once the download is complete open the
[00:01:30] file
[00:01:31] the steps will be different on Windows
[00:01:33] and Mac and I'll show you the Mac
[00:01:35] install but with Windows you can simply
[00:01:38] follow the installation wizard
[00:01:40] on the first screen click agree
[00:01:43] the package will then be verified which
[00:01:45] can take a minute or so
[00:01:47] this PG admin screen will then appear
[00:01:50] drag the PG admin 4 logo from the left
[00:01:52] into the applications folder on the
[00:01:54] right
[00:01:55] the PG admin application will then be
[00:01:57] installed
[00:01:59] once it is completed you can close this
[00:02:01] PG admin window to open PG admin you can
[00:02:04] open it using the spotlight search or
[00:02:06] from the applications folder
[00:02:09] if you're on Windows you can open it
[00:02:11] from either the start menu or a shortcut
[00:02:13] on the desktop if one was created
[00:02:15] once it opens you'll be asked to set a
[00:02:18] master password
[00:02:19] this is a password that lets you access
[00:02:21] PG admin and the database connections
[00:02:23] that you'll set up
[00:02:25] a master password is highly recommended
[00:02:27] by the PG admin team because of the way
[00:02:29] the software is designed and to increase
[00:02:31] security
[00:02:33] enter a password here that you want to
[00:02:35] use and click ok
[00:02:37] you'll then see the main PG admin window
[00:02:41] this is what PG admin looks like when
[00:02:43] you first open it
[00:02:44] there are a few menus at the top for
[00:02:46] file object tools and help
[00:02:50] on the main toolbar there are a range of
[00:02:52] icons some of which we will cover in
[00:02:54] this video
[00:02:55] on the left panel is an entry called
[00:02:57] servers
[00:02:58] this is where you can browse your
[00:03:00] connections and database objects which
[00:03:02] we'll see more of shortly the main panel
[00:03:04] on the screen is where you can write and
[00:03:06] run queries once we have connected to a
[00:03:08] database
[00:03:09] let's do that now to see all of your
[00:03:11] database connections you can click on
[00:03:13] the Arrow next to the servers entry on
[00:03:15] the panel on the left
[00:03:17] if you've just set up postgres and PG
[00:03:19] admin you probably won't see anything
[00:03:21] here
[00:03:22] I've got a couple of connections already
[00:03:24] set up one called postgres 13 and
[00:03:27] another called postgres docker
[00:03:29] we'll create a new connection which is
[00:03:31] called a server in PG admin
[00:03:33] to do that right click on servers and
[00:03:36] select register then server
[00:03:39] you'll see the new server window appear
[00:03:41] enter a name for the server
[00:03:43] I'll enter postgres demo
[00:03:46] you can select the server group here
[00:03:48] which is a way of grouping servers or
[00:03:50] connections inside PG admin and is
[00:03:53] helpful if you have a lot
[00:03:54] we'll leave this as the default
[00:03:57] you can also change the background and
[00:03:59] foreground colors if you like
[00:04:01] click on the connection tab
[00:04:03] in the hostname address field enter the
[00:04:06] address of your postgres database
[00:04:09] if you have postgres running on your
[00:04:11] computer this would be localhost
[00:04:14] otherwise enter another hostname where
[00:04:16] you can access postgres
[00:04:19] enter the password for your database
[00:04:21] toggle the save password if you want to
[00:04:23] save the password and not have to enter
[00:04:25] at each time
[00:04:27] now click the save button on the bottom
[00:04:29] right
[00:04:30] the server will be saved and PG admin
[00:04:32] will attempt to connect
[00:04:34] if you get an error here check that the
[00:04:36] details you've entered are correct and
[00:04:38] if the database is running
[00:04:40] if you're still not sure I would suggest
[00:04:42] searching on Google for the error
[00:04:43] message as others have likely got the
[00:04:45] same error and have resolved it
[00:04:48] once your connection is successful
[00:04:49] you'll see the new server on the left
[00:04:51] with a small postgres elephant icon
[00:04:54] you're now connected to the database
[00:04:56] there is a range of toolbar buttons at
[00:04:58] the top that let you get started with
[00:05:00] SQL but they are all disabled this is
[00:05:03] because we need to select a database
[00:05:04] first
[00:05:06] to do this expand the new server you
[00:05:08] created on the left panel expand
[00:05:11] databases and click on a database that
[00:05:13] exists here
[00:05:14] my server has several databases but
[00:05:16] yours may only have the postgres
[00:05:18] database which is the default
[00:05:21] click on the postgres database
[00:05:23] if you don't have one at all you can
[00:05:25] right click on the databases entry
[00:05:27] select create and then database and fill
[00:05:30] out the form to create one
[00:05:32] when you select a database all of the
[00:05:35] buttons at the top will be enabled
[00:05:38] the first button on the toolbar is a
[00:05:40] cylinder with a triangle on it and is
[00:05:42] called query tool click on this button
[00:05:45] you'll see a new tab open within PG
[00:05:47] admin
[00:05:49] the tab is underlined here and has a
[00:05:51] title that includes the username of
[00:05:53] postgres the database of postgres and
[00:05:56] the server name of postgres demo within
[00:05:58] this tab there is a range of buttons and
[00:06:00] some panels
[00:06:01] at the top there's a drop down that lets
[00:06:04] you select other connections or servers
[00:06:05] if you want to change the server you're
[00:06:07] going to run these queries on
[00:06:09] we can leave it as it is for now
[00:06:12] the next set of buttons will let you
[00:06:14] work with SQL files and run queries
[00:06:16] which we will see shortly
[00:06:19] the main part of the window here is
[00:06:21] where you write and run your SQL queries
[00:06:24] on the right is a panel called
[00:06:25] scratchpad
[00:06:27] this is helpful for storing pieces of
[00:06:28] text as you work with queries instead of
[00:06:31] having to add them to a query or another
[00:06:33] external editor
[00:06:35] you can close this if you like and can
[00:06:37] show it again by clicking on the reset
[00:06:39] layout button here on the top right
[00:06:40] let's write our first query
[00:06:43] will create a new table then we will
[00:06:45] insert data into it and select from it
[00:06:48] we'll create a table called PG test with
[00:06:51] just one column
[00:06:53] once you've written the create table
[00:06:54] statement you can run it by pressing F5
[00:06:57] or clicking on the triangle button here
[00:06:59] which will execute the query
[00:07:01] the statement is run and is hopefully
[00:07:03] successful
[00:07:04] you'll see a success message in the
[00:07:06] message panel at the bottom of the
[00:07:08] window
[00:07:09] now we have a table let's insert some
[00:07:12] data into it
[00:07:13] remove the create table statement and
[00:07:15] write an insert statement into our new
[00:07:17] PG test table
[00:07:19] run this statement by pressing F5 or
[00:07:22] clicking the execute button again
[00:07:24] you'll see in the messages tab that the
[00:07:26] statement was successful
[00:07:29] let's write a select statement to see
[00:07:31] the data in the table
[00:07:33] however this time we'll leave the insert
[00:07:35] statement there
[00:07:36] enter the select statement after the
[00:07:38] insert statement like this
[00:07:41] we've got two statements here but we
[00:07:43] only want to run the select statement
[00:07:45] and not the insert statement
[00:07:47] to do this you can highlight the
[00:07:49] statement you want to run and click the
[00:07:51] execute button
[00:07:52] this will ensure only this statement is
[00:07:54] run
[00:07:55] we can see the output at the bottom of
[00:07:57] the screen
[00:07:58] the data output tab is shown and it
[00:08:01] includes the column header and a single
[00:08:03] row that we inserted with the value of
[00:08:04] hello
[00:08:06] what's also helpful is that it shows the
[00:08:08] data type of the column
[00:08:10] in this example it shows character
[00:08:12] varying 10 which is the same as varchar
[00:08:15] which is what we used when we created
[00:08:17] the table
[00:08:18] this is a handy feature if you're
[00:08:20] working with results and want to know
[00:08:22] what the format is if you don't
[00:08:24] highlight any of the queries and just
[00:08:25] click execute then all queries will be
[00:08:28] run
[00:08:29] we can see here that the data output
[00:08:31] shows two rows because the insert
[00:08:33] statement was run again then the select
[00:08:35] statement
[00:08:39] if you run a select statement and want
[00:08:41] to save the results to a file such as a
[00:08:43] CSV file you can do that easily in PG
[00:08:46] admin
[00:08:47] click on this button here called save
[00:08:49] results to file
[00:08:51] you'll then be prompted to enter a file
[00:08:53] name or use the one that is generated
[00:08:55] you can also select a location
[00:08:58] click save and the results are saved to
[00:09:00] a CSV file you can save the SQL queries
[00:09:03] you have written to a file on your
[00:09:05] computer
[00:09:06] to do this click on the save file button
[00:09:08] on the toolbar
[00:09:10] you will be asked to enter a file name
[00:09:12] and then select a location
[00:09:14] once you do that and click save the file
[00:09:16] is saved
[00:09:18] the title of the tab also changes to
[00:09:20] match your file name so you can identify
[00:09:22] it easily if you have more than one open
[00:09:25] if you want to open a file you have
[00:09:27] saved before you can click on the open
[00:09:29] button here browse to the file and then
[00:09:32] open it
[00:09:34] next to the save button is an edit
[00:09:36] button click on this and you get a range
[00:09:38] of options
[00:09:39] you can find a value in your script
[00:09:41] which is helpful for long scripts and
[00:09:43] for finding a specific number or word
[00:09:46] you can replace which can replace all
[00:09:48] instances of one value with another
[00:09:51] the jump option will let you easily
[00:09:53] navigate to a specific line or a scroll
[00:09:55] percentage of the window
[00:09:57] intent selection will indent the
[00:09:59] selected lines or the current line in
[00:10:01] your code
[00:10:02] an indent selection will remove the
[00:10:04] indent from the line of code
[00:10:07] toggle comments will convert the line to
[00:10:09] a comment by adding two dashes in front
[00:10:11] of it which also changes the color to
[00:10:13] Orange
[00:10:14] select toggle comment again by removing
[00:10:16] the comment
[00:10:18] if you select some text and click toggle
[00:10:20] case of selected text you can change the
[00:10:23] case between uppercase and lowercase
[00:10:25] this is an easy way to convert between
[00:10:27] cases
[00:10:29] if you click clear query all of your
[00:10:31] queries will be removed and you'll be
[00:10:33] left with a blank query editor
[00:10:36] finally the format SQL option will
[00:10:38] format your queries based on some rules
[00:10:40] in PG admin to make your query easier to
[00:10:42] read
[00:10:43] some other things it does I separate
[00:10:45] Clauses onto new lines and convert
[00:10:47] keywords to uppercase if you want to get
[00:10:49] the most out of PG admin I've created a
[00:10:51] bonus guide for you with some of the
[00:10:53] main features and common keyboard
[00:10:55] shortcuts check out the link in the
[00:10:57] description below to get access to it
[00:10:59] another feature of PGA admin is seeing
[00:11:02] an explain plan
[00:11:03] this allows you to see how the database
[00:11:05] will run your query
[00:11:07] to see this select your query and click
[00:11:09] the explain button
[00:11:11] this will estimate the time it will take
[00:11:12] to run the query and show how it may be
[00:11:15] run
[00:11:16] click on the explain tab in the output
[00:11:18] if it's not shown already
[00:11:20] this will show a graphical view of the
[00:11:22] query plan
[00:11:23] it's only a single entry called PG test
[00:11:26] because it's a simple query but more
[00:11:28] complicated queries will show more here
[00:11:32] you can click on analysis to see more
[00:11:34] details of the plan and finally click on
[00:11:37] statistics to see more information
[00:11:39] the next button on the toolbar is called
[00:11:41] explain analyze
[00:11:43] this is similar to explain except that
[00:11:46] it actually runs the query and shows you
[00:11:47] what was actually done
[00:11:49] both the explain and explain analyze can
[00:11:52] be helpful when trying to understand a
[00:11:54] slow query and how to improve it
[00:11:56] PG admin supports having multiple tabs
[00:11:59] or editors
[00:12:00] this allows you to work on more than one
[00:12:02] query at a time or more than one
[00:12:04] connection
[00:12:05] to do this you can click on the query
[00:12:07] tool button like you did before on the
[00:12:09] left of the main toolbar
[00:12:11] another way to do it is to click on this
[00:12:13] button next to the connection drop down
[00:12:15] it's called new query tool for the
[00:12:17] current connection and is an easy way to
[00:12:20] create a new query window without having
[00:12:22] to find the connection on the left panel
[00:12:24] again
[00:12:25] when you click this button a new tab is
[00:12:27] opened with a new empty query editor
[00:12:31] you can perform all of the same things
[00:12:32] that we saw in this editor without
[00:12:34] impacting your queries in the other
[00:12:36] editor
[00:12:37] if you want to close this editor tab you
[00:12:40] can click on the X on the top right of
[00:12:41] the window here
[00:12:43] this tab is closed and you'll return to
[00:12:45] the previous one a handy feature in PG
[00:12:47] admin is the ability to find a database
[00:12:49] object
[00:12:50] if you know the name of something and
[00:12:52] want to access it easily or no part of
[00:12:55] the name you can find it in PG admin
[00:12:58] click on the magnifying glass icon here
[00:13:00] on the left panel and the search objects
[00:13:02] window will appear enter the whole or
[00:13:05] part of an object name in this text box
[00:13:06] and click search
[00:13:09] you'll see the results of the search
[00:13:10] appear including the name of the object
[00:13:12] and its type
[00:13:14] if you double click on it the object
[00:13:16] will be selected in the left panel where
[00:13:18] you can perform additional tasks on it
[00:13:20] by right-clicking on it
[00:13:22] there are many other features in PG
[00:13:24] admin that you might find useful
[00:13:26] I'll briefly cover them here as they
[00:13:28] probably deserve a video on their own
[00:13:30] you can generate an ERD or entity
[00:13:32] relationship diagram in PG admin to do
[00:13:35] this go to tools then ERD tool
[00:13:39] a new tab is open that allows you to
[00:13:41] create an ERD I'll have a separate video
[00:13:44] on how to use this
[00:13:45] click the X if you want to close this
[00:13:47] tab
[00:13:49] in the tools menu there is also a schema
[00:13:51] diff feature which is helpful for
[00:13:53] finding the differences between objects
[00:13:55] in different schemas
[00:13:57] if you click on this option a new tab is
[00:13:59] open that allows you to select the
[00:14:00] source and Target servers
[00:14:03] it will then let you compare two objects
[00:14:04] and see the difference between them
[00:14:07] there is a range of other features in
[00:14:09] the tools menu including database backup
[00:14:11] Import and Export data and accessing
[00:14:14] psql
[00:14:15] I'll create videos on these features but
[00:14:18] until then feel free to play around with
[00:14:20] them PG admin has a range of preferences
[00:14:23] that you can change to see them go to
[00:14:26] file then preferences
[00:14:28] a new window is displayed
[00:14:30] on the left panel is a list of
[00:14:32] categories of preferences and on the
[00:14:34] right is the preferences for the
[00:14:35] selected category
[00:14:37] take a look through this list and see if

[00:14:42] earlier when we formatted our SQL it
[00:14:44] used the settings that are available in
[00:14:46] the query tool then SQL formatting
[00:14:48] section
[00:14:50] you can select the SQL formatting entry
[00:14:52] to see and change any of these settings
[00:14:54] if you want the formatter to work
[00:14:56] differently
[00:14:57] once you're done click cancel to exit or
[00:15:00] save to save changes in exit so that's a
[00:15:03] brief overview of the PG admin tool we
[00:15:05] focused on the basics but as you can see
[00:15:07] there is a lot more that it can do
[00:15:10] it's a big improvement over PG admin 3
[00:15:12] and it's still a pretty popular IDE for
[00:15:14] postgres
