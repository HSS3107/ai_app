Transcript:

[00:00:00] over the past 15 years I've been focused
[00:00:02] on one thing building startups from
[00:00:04] scratch I also served as the Director of
[00:00:06] an accelerator program based in Los
[00:00:08] Angeles partnered with Google and today
[00:00:10] I've trained more than 600 Founders who
[00:00:11] have gone on to raise more than $56
[00:00:13] million in funding I've also been
[00:00:15] invited as a guest lecturer to speak at
[00:00:17] prestigious universities such as UCLA
[00:00:20] Princeton Pepperdine and several more
[00:00:22] I've also sold startups and failed
[00:00:24] startups so I'm here today to tell you
[00:00:26] everything that you need to learn how to
[00:00:28] build a startup how to launch a startup
[00:00:30] how to grow a startup and how to sell a
[00:00:33] startup I'm literally going to teach you
[00:00:34] all the strategies and tools that you
[00:00:36] can use to go from idea to revenue
[00:00:38] generating business without having any
[00:00:40] technical skills and yes 100% for free
[00:00:43] but I can tell you right now that if
[00:00:45] you're not even able to sit through this
[00:00:46] entire video from start to finish and
[00:00:48] it's very unlikely that you're going to
[00:00:49] become a successful entrepreneur now
[00:00:51] here are the topics that I'm going to
[00:00:52] cover in this video first I'm going to
[00:00:54] teach you how to come up with killer
[00:00:55] startup ideas from scratch I'm then
[00:00:56] going to teach you how to test any
[00:00:58] startup idea cost effectively of course
[00:01:00] and then I'm going to teach you how to
[00:01:01] build a brand without expensive
[00:01:03] designers then we're going to jump into
[00:01:05] how to build a website without any
[00:01:07] coding skills at all leveraging no code
[00:01:09] I'm going to teach you how to shift to
[00:01:10] the entrepreneur mindset it's completely
[00:01:12] different from what you have at a 9 to-5
[00:01:14] job we're then going to jump into how to
[00:01:16] build your MVP or the first version of
[00:01:18] your app leveraging these no code tools
[00:01:20] we're going to talk about how to pick
[00:01:21] the right business model for you we're
[00:01:23] then going to jump into how to sell then
[00:01:24] we're going to talk about how to get
[00:01:26] your first paying customers then how we
[00:01:28] can build scalable marketing strategies
[00:01:30] you're going to see that those things
[00:01:30] are completely different we're going to
[00:01:32] talk about how to use AI to accelerate
[00:01:34] your business of course without getting
[00:01:35] lost in thousands of tools how we can
[00:01:37] use no code automation to scale our
[00:01:39] business how to find a co-founder this
[00:01:41] can be gamechanging then how to create a
[00:01:43] pitch deck which is the modern version
[00:01:45] of a business plan how to get investors
[00:01:47] and how to get them to write that first
[00:01:48] check for you how Equity works and how
[00:01:50] it can be a powerful tool to motivate
[00:01:52] your team we're then going to talk about
[00:01:53] how to sell a business and finally as a
[00:01:55] bonus module I'll be talking about some
[00:01:56] of the largest mistakes that you can
[00:01:58] make and how to avoid them because we
[00:01:59] have so much to cover let's Jump Right
[00:02:01] In okay so first and foremost how do you
[00:02:02] come up with a killer startup idea well
[00:02:05] you've actually been sold three big Lies
[00:02:07] over the past decade probably that are
[00:02:09] stopping you from getting started the
[00:02:11] first lie comes from movies like The
[00:02:12] Social Network where Mark Zuckerberg
[00:02:14] suddenly gets this amazing idea for
[00:02:17] Facebook he runs to his studio apartment
[00:02:19] and starts building it it's this idea of
[00:02:21] a light bulb moment that just lands on
[00:02:23] you and you have this perfect idea but
[00:02:25] I'm sorry to tell you that that is not
[00:02:27] the way that most great startups are
[00:02:29] built and frankly unless you want to
[00:02:30] stay sat on your couch for the rest of
[00:02:32] your life waiting for that light bulb
[00:02:33] moment there is a much better way you
[00:02:35] can actually actively generate startup
[00:02:37] ideas and then select one of them to get
[00:02:39] started with and in this section I'm
[00:02:41] going to break down three ways that you
[00:02:42] can do that actively instead of just
[00:02:44] waiting the second big lie is that you
[00:02:45] have to come up with this groundbreaking
[00:02:48] revolutionary idea that completely
[00:02:49] changes the world we've kind of bought
[00:02:51] into this narrative because of big
[00:02:53] headlines on Tech crunch but that
[00:02:54] honestly couldn't be further from the
[00:02:56] truth Sam par for example the founder of
[00:02:58] the hustle builds built and sold a
[00:03:01] newsletter for $30 million nothing
[00:03:03] revolutionary it's just a newsletter and
[00:03:05] years later he even convinced his friend
[00:03:07] Shan puy to launch his own called the
[00:03:09] milk road that was also sold for eight
[00:03:11] figures so a much better strategy for
[00:03:13] you is to come up with an existing
[00:03:14] business model or concept and just have
[00:03:17] a nice twist or focus on a specific
[00:03:19] Niche revolutionizing the world is
[00:03:21] overrated now the third and final lie is
[00:03:23] that you have to have a perfect idea and
[00:03:25] a perfect plan here's the truth you will
[00:03:29] be if not completely a little bit wrong
[00:03:31] at least once you go to market with that
[00:03:33] idea so starting off with a rough idea
[00:03:36] and going to Market quickly is always
[00:03:38] going to beat overthinking overanalyzing
[00:03:42] researching the entire market for months
[00:03:44] and months and months coming up with the
[00:03:45] perfect brand name for this thing
[00:03:47] instead of actually just going to the
[00:03:49] market and testing it which is what
[00:03:50] we're going to teach in the next module
[00:03:52] but to test an idea we need an idea so
[00:03:54] let's talk about the three active
[00:03:55] methods that you can use to come up with
[00:03:57] your idea and decide which ones to start
[00:03:58] with the first method is is all about
[00:04:00] writing down problems every single day
[00:04:02] you want to probably write about three
[00:04:03] problems a day for about 30 days you'll
[00:04:06] probably have 90 problems they could be
[00:04:07] as simple as complex as you want so it
[00:04:09] could be like I left my keys at home or
[00:04:11] it could be this AI algorithm is
[00:04:13] difficult to understand and they could
[00:04:14] be happening to you they could also be
[00:04:16] happening to other people that you know
[00:04:17] who are complaining about their problems
[00:04:19] you could also go and research online
[00:04:20] problems that other people are having
[00:04:22] the goal at the end is to have 90
[00:04:23] problems and then to think about 90
[00:04:25] solutions that could solve that problem
[00:04:27] the second one is based on Trends so you
[00:04:28] can go to the internet and find
[00:04:30] Consulting companies that are basically
[00:04:32] making all their predictions you can
[00:04:34] find a couple trends that you believe
[00:04:35] are definitely going to happen then when
[00:04:37] you can start doing is figuring out like
[00:04:39] okay what kind of businesses are going
[00:04:41] to be built if this trend is correct and
[00:04:44] then you want to write down a couple of
[00:04:45] needs that would come up if that trend
[00:04:47] is right and each one of those needs you
[00:04:49] got it can be converted into a startup
[00:04:52] idea and yes the goal is to come up with
[00:04:53] a bunch of ideas because then we're
[00:04:54] going to want to filter through and come
[00:04:56] up with just one that we're going to
[00:04:57] work on we're going to talk about that
[00:04:58] later now the third strategy I called
[00:04:59] the rora strategy because a rora fish is
[00:05:02] a fish that lives off of larger fish
[00:05:04] like sharks or Turtles for example and
[00:05:07] they basically eat the food that's left
[00:05:09] behind and although that might sound a
[00:05:10] little silly some of the large companies
[00:05:12] that you know today like Airbnb Uber or
[00:05:15] maybe Tinder are leaving huge million
[00:05:18] dooll opportunities because of the
[00:05:20] demand that they're already generating
[00:05:22] the concept here is basically to create
[00:05:25] complimentary goods and services for
[00:05:27] these larger and growing companies
[00:05:30] that they would probably never go after
[00:05:31] so for the idea of Airbnb you could come
[00:05:33] up with something like a subscription
[00:05:35] box for small shampoos for all the hosts
[00:05:37] to be able to easily get them delivered
[00:05:39] on a monthly basis they're probably
[00:05:41] buying these things already so the goal
[00:05:42] with this strategy is to come up with 30
[00:05:44] different businesses that you think are
[00:05:46] going to continue to grow over the next
[00:05:47] 10 years and then you basically Target
[00:05:50] their audiences okay so once you've done
[00:05:52] that you have a bunch of startup ideas
[00:05:54] so how do you pick which one you
[00:05:56] actually want to execute on first well
[00:05:58] let me actually show you on this board
[00:05:59] right now so so first of all I would
[00:06:00] actually rank them so it's like you want
[00:06:02] to figure out which ones are in the top
[00:06:04] ideas that you have and then you can
[00:06:06] select one of those top ideas so
[00:06:08] basically we're rating them from 1 to 10
[00:06:10] based on different criteria the criteria
[00:06:12] that I like to use are as follows the
[00:06:14] problem is this a really big problem is
[00:06:17] this a small problem how severe is it
[00:06:20] how often is it happening to these
[00:06:22] individuals how good are the customers
[00:06:24] are they easy to reach are they easy to
[00:06:26] convince how quickly do they make a
[00:06:29] decision how well is the founder fit for
[00:06:31] this specific idea so founder fit I
[00:06:34] would put as one of the big criteria and
[00:06:36] you can select the criteria you want I
[00:06:38] might have things like ease of execution
[00:06:40] like do I have the resources do I think
[00:06:41] I can actually pull this off then based
[00:06:43] on these scores you're going to have a
[00:06:44] short list so at this point based on the
[00:06:46] short list you might know exactly which
[00:06:47] idea you want but if you still have a
[00:06:48] hard time deciding which one I would
[00:06:50] actually grab your passion like how much
[00:06:52] passion do you have for this let's make
[00:06:54] that one Circle then we can have another
[00:06:56] Circle be the uh skills that are
[00:06:59] required to execute on that and we can
[00:07:01] make this another Circle then the
[00:07:03] resources do you have the resources how
[00:07:06] easy is it to get access to those
[00:07:08] resources for you right now those might
[00:07:10] be money those might be uh team members
[00:07:13] and basically right here my friends is
[00:07:15] where you will be able to make a
[00:07:17] decision on which idea is best to take
[00:07:19] action on so the idea here is to pick an
[00:07:20] idea that we can learn the skills and
[00:07:23] the process of launching a startup with
[00:07:24] we want to figure out cost effectively
[00:07:26] if we are right or wrong about this idea
[00:07:28] whether we need to change it a little
[00:07:29] bit for it to fit the market properly or
[00:07:31] whether we are completely off that's
[00:07:33] exactly what we're going to talk about
[00:07:35] in the next section okay so now let's
[00:07:36] talk about how to test any idea cost
[00:07:38] effectively now it doesn't matter what
[00:07:41] you think it doesn't matter what I think
[00:07:44] it doesn't matter what anyone thinks
[00:07:45] about your startup idea the only thing
[00:07:47] that matters is what your customers say
[00:07:50] they want but more importantly where
[00:07:52] they put their money and just like Mike
[00:07:54] Tyson says it everyone has a plan until
[00:07:56] they get punched in the face and that's
[00:07:58] pretty much exactly what happen happens
[00:08:00] when you bring a product or idea to
[00:08:02] Market there's almost no likelihood that
[00:08:03] you're going to be 100% right about all
[00:08:05] your assumptions so the most important
[00:08:07] thing is to quickly test and validate
[00:08:10] your startup idea before you dump years
[00:08:12] of your life and all of your savings
[00:08:14] into it but what are you actually
[00:08:16] looking for when you test your startup
[00:08:17] idea and how do you actually execute on
[00:08:20] that I'll get into the what specifically
[00:08:21] in just a couple of moments but first
[00:08:23] let's talk about what we're actually
[00:08:25] looking for you see there are actually
[00:08:26] three huge pieces of the puzzle that
[00:08:28] make all the difference and we have have
[00:08:29] to figure out early on why because it'll
[00:08:31] bite Us in the butt later unless we
[00:08:33] figure them out early on the first one
[00:08:35] is the ICP what does that mean it means
[00:08:39] ideal customer profile so basically who
[00:08:44] are you going to be going after remember
[00:08:45] you have limited time and money to go
[00:08:47] after different segments and some
[00:08:49] customers are going to be way better
[00:08:51] than others they'll have the money they
[00:08:52] have the problem they're willing to pay
[00:08:54] to solve it some people are going to be
[00:08:55] very difficult to reach very difficult
[00:08:57] to convince they don't have the money to
[00:08:59] pay for for it yada yada so early on we
[00:09:01] have ideas of different segments of the
[00:09:02] market or different ideal profiles that
[00:09:05] we think would be interested in buying
[00:09:07] this product so we're going to want to
[00:09:08] test out who that person is and whether
[00:09:10] or not we are right or wrong identify
[00:09:12] the right one number two is the problem
[00:09:14] so if we've identified the individual
[00:09:16] then let's talk and figure out the
[00:09:19] problem does the ICP that we've chosen
[00:09:22] actually have the problem that we are
[00:09:24] trying to solve are they already trying
[00:09:26] to solve it is this a problem that they
[00:09:28] would be willing to to pay for to solve
[00:09:30] if we can't identify the very clear
[00:09:32] problem and more importantly the outcome
[00:09:35] that they want in using your product
[00:09:37] then it's going to be very difficult to
[00:09:39] get them to pay anything and the third
[00:09:40] thing we absolutely need to get right is
[00:09:42] are people willing to actually pay for
[00:09:45] it this is the difference between a
[00:09:48] money hole and a revenue generating
[00:09:50] business and if we don't get these three
[00:09:52] pieces of the puzzle right early on it
[00:09:54] doesn't matter what else you do it
[00:09:55] doesn't matter how beautiful your
[00:09:57] product is because if it doesn't solve
[00:09:59] the problem provide the outcome and no
[00:10:01] one will be willing to pay for it if
[00:10:02] we're after the wrong individual we're
[00:10:04] going to be convincing people all day
[00:10:06] long and it's going to be a huge waste
[00:10:07] of our time so these are the three
[00:10:09] things we absolutely need to figure out
[00:10:11] and of course if we don't know how to
[00:10:13] monetize it well we do not have a
[00:10:15] business well my friends you'll be glad
[00:10:17] to know that there are two methods that
[00:10:18] have been used in Silicon Valley for
[00:10:20] half a century that allow you to test
[00:10:23] these different things out the first one
[00:10:25] is called customer Discovery now this is
[00:10:27] a process through which we set up
[00:10:29] interviews or conversations with our
[00:10:31] future potential ideal customer profiles
[00:10:35] and we find out a little bit more about
[00:10:37] their life and we start asking them
[00:10:39] questions about their life their current
[00:10:41] process so we can understand if they are
[00:10:43] actually facing the problem that we
[00:10:44] believe they are facing now the biggest
[00:10:46] mistake people make when they're told
[00:10:47] hey go and talk to customers is to
[00:10:49] actually talk about their product this
[00:10:51] is not a pitch at all this is a
[00:10:53] conversation that we're having to just
[00:10:55] understand how people currently live
[00:10:56] their life to see whether or not they're
[00:10:58] the right person to talk Target with the
[00:11:00] product or service that we have in mind
[00:11:01] and if you talk about your product early
[00:11:02] on people are going to give you the mom
[00:11:04] treatment everyone's mom is going to
[00:11:05] tell them that they are beautiful and
[00:11:07] nice and that's really nice but it's not
[00:11:08] going to help us figure out the harsh
[00:11:10] truth behind whether or not this startup
[00:11:12] is going to succeed another key rule
[00:11:13] here is to not ask if would you could
[00:11:16] you is to really focus on past Behavior
[00:11:20] because past behavior is the best way to
[00:11:22] determine future Behavior so instead of
[00:11:24] being like would you pay for a tool that
[00:11:27] did this that the other what we're going
[00:11:28] to ask for is tell us about the last
[00:11:31] time that you faced this problem tell us
[00:11:33] about the last time you XYZ what was the
[00:11:36] biggest problem in actually doing that
[00:11:38] did you try to solve this problem or not
[00:11:40] maybe the problem you think isn't even
[00:11:42] the problem that comes up but how do you
[00:11:44] find these people and how do you book
[00:11:45] interviews with them well that would be
[00:11:47] through Linkedin prospecting you could
[00:11:49] also do it by going to forums and
[00:11:51] finding where people are talking about
[00:11:53] these kind of problems and have a
[00:11:54] conversation but these conversations are
[00:11:56] fundamental and they connect directly
[00:11:58] into sales which we'll talk about later
[00:12:00] on in this video now how many of these
[00:12:02] interviews should you do well you
[00:12:03] probably want to start off with probably
[00:12:05] three per category or per profile that
[00:12:07] you have like different customer
[00:12:09] segments and then if you find demand
[00:12:12] specifically behind one of them you want
[00:12:13] to probably have five or 10 additional
[00:12:15] interviews to kind of confirm that
[00:12:17] people are saying similar things now one
[00:12:20] big problem with customer interviews is
[00:12:21] that people say one thing but they do
[00:12:24] something completely different all of us
[00:12:26] have this problem in life so the second
[00:12:28] strategy to test and validate your
[00:12:29] startup idea is called the smoke test so
[00:12:32] what is this why should we do it and how
[00:12:34] do we actually do it well the concept is
[00:12:36] that you build a landing page that
[00:12:38] really describes your offer as if you
[00:12:40] had built the entire product and Company
[00:12:42] out and you were ready for customers to
[00:12:44] come and buy because we're going to use
[00:12:46] that to test people's actions on that
[00:12:48] page through what we call a CTA a call
[00:12:51] to action so a call to action could be a
[00:12:53] fake download button that shows us
[00:12:55] people would download this app if we had
[00:12:56] built it it could be a fake Buy button
[00:12:59] if we had a product that we were trying
[00:13:01] to sell it could be a sign up for the
[00:13:03] weit list early on the goal is to test
[00:13:06] people's actions instead of just their
[00:13:07] words and we want to do this because
[00:13:09] most people build entire products then
[00:13:12] launch them they hear complete crickets
[00:13:15] and worse than that when they actually
[00:13:17] go out there and get customers to use
[00:13:19] the product they've built the wrong
[00:13:21] product for that customer and now it's
[00:13:23] so complicated to unbuild rebuild it's a
[00:13:27] pain in the neck and we want you to
[00:13:28] avoid that that so we want you to build
[00:13:30] as close to a great product the first
[00:13:33] time and then we know we're going to
[00:13:34] have to adapt it but at least we are way
[00:13:36] closer to the truth the first time
[00:13:38] around so the value of building the
[00:13:39] smoke test is to generate the demand and
[00:13:41] have it lined up for when you actually
[00:13:43] launch the product as well as building a
[00:13:46] product that is way closer to what the
[00:13:48] customer actually wants versus what we
[00:13:51] have in our head but probably the most
[00:13:52] important part of this is really getting
[00:13:55] your offer right so let's talk about how
[00:13:57] we want to structure that offer in a way
[00:13:59] that is enticing now of course to build
[00:14:00] this out you're going to need a logo
[00:14:02] you're going to need a color palette and
[00:14:03] other things that have to do with
[00:14:05] branding and content we'll talk about
[00:14:06] that in the next module right now I want
[00:14:08] to focus in on the value proposition
[00:14:10] which is essentially the offer and how
[00:14:12] to structure that on a onepage website
[00:14:14] now the first section you're going to
[00:14:15] have is called the hero section and it's
[00:14:17] basically a section through which you
[00:14:19] are delivering the core promise if you
[00:14:22] don't get any other parts of this right
[00:14:25] you need to nail this part because every
[00:14:28] single person who clicks and goes to
[00:14:29] your website sees this first page only
[00:14:32] about 50% maybe 20% scroll to the bottom
[00:14:35] so this section is all about the core
[00:14:38] promise you're going to have a m main
[00:14:40] headline here that's probably two maybe
[00:14:43] three lines in large text and this has
[00:14:45] to be the ultimate outcome and you want
[00:14:47] to write this in very plain English then
[00:14:50] you want to have an image over here
[00:14:52] that's going to essentially help
[00:14:55] visualize the promise here so it has to
[00:14:58] add to this and this together is the
[00:15:00] promise now another thing that you're
[00:15:01] going to have as well is a sub text
[00:15:04] under this one here this is going to be
[00:15:05] smaller text which is a little bit more
[00:15:07] focused on talking about the product and
[00:15:10] what it can do for people so this is the
[00:15:12] actual promise like the outcome with
[00:15:15] this and then underneath it is the thing
[00:15:17] that delivers that outcome so for
[00:15:18] example at we are NOCO we teach people
[00:15:20] how to launch their startups so this
[00:15:21] might be launch your startup with no
[00:15:25] code and AI right the end goal they're
[00:15:28] looking for is to Launch lach their
[00:15:29] startup right uh or build a revenue
[00:15:32] generating business with no code and
[00:15:33] then here I might have some of the
[00:15:35] elements that showcase what that looks
[00:15:36] like so it might be some Learning
[00:15:38] Materials like uh the coaching sessions
[00:15:40] that we have it might be some people the
[00:15:42] community that people get access to the
[00:15:44] discount it might just be kind of a
[00:15:46] bundle package that's shown here and
[00:15:48] then underneath we talk about the
[00:15:49] description so the description is
[00:15:51] basically talking about the product so
[00:15:52] it's like the no code startup which is
[00:15:54] the name of our program is a online
[00:15:57] program for your cust customer uh
[00:15:59] non-technical entrepreneurs to launch
[00:16:02] their startup cost effectively so this
[00:16:04] is the most important thing that
[00:16:05] everyone will see it is called again the
[00:16:07] hero section and make sure that you get
[00:16:10] this right for your startup now
[00:16:11] underneath the hero there is the next
[00:16:13] section which is the benefits section so
[00:16:16] basically the benefits are kind of like
[00:16:18] um the smaller outcomes that people get
[00:16:21] from using your product again you are
[00:16:23] selling the outcomes you are selling the
[00:16:25] benefits in using your product you're
[00:16:27] not talking about features you're not
[00:16:28] talking about your product prod so the
[00:16:29] way I usually structure this and this
[00:16:30] would come right underneath the hero
[00:16:32] section would be essentially to have
[00:16:35] three of the benefits right I would have
[00:16:37] a little title very concrete just one
[00:16:40] quick line that explains what you would
[00:16:42] get um and then underneath you could
[00:16:44] have an additional description if you
[00:16:45] wanted so if we're talking about the
[00:16:46] outcome being launch your Revenue
[00:16:48] generating business then this first one
[00:16:51] could be test your idea cost effectively
[00:16:54] this one could be something like build
[00:16:56] the first version of your app with no
[00:16:58] code tools and this one would be learn
[00:17:00] proven strategies to get paying
[00:17:02] customers now we can get into the actual
[00:17:04] features which are the things that are
[00:17:06] going to fulfill the benefits here so
[00:17:08] this next one is features so again this
[00:17:11] section is going to be something a
[00:17:13] little bit similar usually I see it as
[00:17:15] um it could be just a couple of icons it
[00:17:17] could be let's say six it could be also
[00:17:20] four on one line um similar structure
[00:17:23] usually icons instead of illustrations
[00:17:25] but you can pretty much choose what it
[00:17:27] is you want to make it very simple so
[00:17:30] that people can really understand each
[00:17:32] one of these features has to link back
[00:17:35] to one of the benefits because remember
[00:17:37] the features are only interesting to
[00:17:39] people because they're the actual things
[00:17:41] that allow people to get the benefits
[00:17:43] and so again we are selling benefits
[00:17:45] we're selling outcomes these are really
[00:17:47] to show them how we're going to deliver
[00:17:49] those now the next section might be a
[00:17:50] how it works not every single product
[00:17:53] needs this um but if it needs explaining
[00:17:56] you might have to create a section for
[00:17:57] it basically this section I would create
[00:17:59] as just a simple section it might be
[00:18:01] like 1 2 3 and it's like you sign up you
[00:18:06] connect your data and then um you know
[00:18:08] you basically that data is organized uh
[00:18:11] for you and you can check out your
[00:18:12] analytics I don't know this is basically
[00:18:14] just bring them through make it as
[00:18:16] simple as possible people don't really
[00:18:17] know what you do you need to make it as
[00:18:19] easy to understand as possible you can
[00:18:21] also um write underneath some subtext if
[00:18:23] you'd like uh again not every single
[00:18:25] product needs a description of how it
[00:18:27] works but I thought it was important to
[00:18:28] put there this comes underneath the
[00:18:30] featur section afterwards let's talk
[00:18:33] about what we are going to have right
[00:18:35] after that well here we're actually
[00:18:36] going to have a section called
[00:18:39] CTA now CTA is the call to action again
[00:18:43] you have to determine which call to
[00:18:44] action you want to have you want to have
[00:18:46] a whole section with a button that's
[00:18:49] going to be your CTA a CTA is pretty
[00:18:52] much a button right uh there's going to
[00:18:53] be text uh large text here there's going
[00:18:55] to be a small description here of what
[00:18:57] people are clicking to get so it's uh
[00:18:59] join today it is uh sign up for the wait
[00:19:02] list um honestly I would go mainly for
[00:19:05] something that's going to prove there's
[00:19:06] demand so basically um buy or uh
[00:19:10] download the app and then it when people
[00:19:13] click on it they actually go to the next
[00:19:14] screen which is going to be like you
[00:19:15] know what if we had a buy button it
[00:19:17] might say right now we haven't yet we
[00:19:19] don't have stock uh you know sign up to
[00:19:21] be the first to receive a notification
[00:19:23] once we do or if it's an app it's we are
[00:19:26] not we are about to launch this make
[00:19:28] sure sure to be the first to get
[00:19:29] notified when we launch and here's where
[00:19:31] we're going to capture their emails and
[00:19:32] we're going to be able to get access to
[00:19:34] a first weit list of people who want to
[00:19:36] buy our product now the call to action
[00:19:38] should also be in the hero page
[00:19:40] underneath that little description that
[00:19:41] we talked about so basically headline
[00:19:44] description underneath you have a little
[00:19:46] button as well and you can have it in
[00:19:47] different parts of the smoke test but
[00:19:49] make sure to keep the same CTA each time
[00:19:51] now one thing I didn't mention here is
[00:19:53] that if you have any type of social
[00:19:54] proof those could be testimonials those
[00:19:56] could be uh you know people who have
[00:19:58] already committed to using this Partners
[00:20:01] uh sponsors then you might want to use
[00:20:03] them also in this but a lot of people
[00:20:05] start off and they don't have that
[00:20:06] that's why I didn't bring it up now in
[00:20:08] the next two sections we're going to
[00:20:09] show you how to build a brand and to
[00:20:10] build a website like this one that we've
[00:20:12] just shown you without having any design
[00:20:14] or technical skills but yes your main
[00:20:16] goal with the smoke test is to get
[00:20:17] people to sign up also to fine-tune your
[00:20:20] offer and to understand which customers
[00:20:22] you're going after if it seems like
[00:20:24] they're actually interested in this
[00:20:25] product through their actions and yes
[00:20:27] it's way easier to adapt your offer on a
[00:20:29] landing page than it is to rebuild your
[00:20:31] entire product now to test out this
[00:20:33] offer you can also test out some paid
[00:20:35] ads and literally learning how to
[00:20:37] structure your offer build out a landing
[00:20:39] page start testing the demand behind it
[00:20:41] is the difference between you just
[00:20:42] sitting back and doing nothing being an
[00:20:44] idea person and being an execution
[00:20:46] person who can take action every single
[00:20:48] time they have an idea now before
[00:20:50] building out our smoke test we need to
[00:20:52] come up with branding and content so the
[00:20:53] next section I'm going to teach you how
[00:20:54] to build a brand with no designers how
[00:20:57] to build your brand without designers
[00:20:59] this is probably one of the areas where
[00:21:02] people sink and waste the most time in
[00:21:05] the process of building their startup
[00:21:06] they spend months finding the perfect
[00:21:08] name and buying endless domain name they
[00:21:10] spend dozens of weeks trying to perfect
[00:21:13] that logo they have in mind and usually
[00:21:14] spend thousands of dollars on trademarks
[00:21:17] hiring designers and this is exactly
[00:21:19] what I'm trying to save you from today
[00:21:21] now the harsh reality is that people
[00:21:22] aren't going to buy from you because you
[00:21:24] have a Pixel Perfect logo they're going
[00:21:26] to buy from you because you have a value
[00:21:28] prop position that solves the problem
[00:21:31] they're trying to solve and that the
[00:21:33] solving of that problem is worth more to
[00:21:35] them than the actual price that they're
[00:21:37] paying for it so your ultimate goal with
[00:21:39] the brand is to do something that is
[00:21:40] good and then to move on and the great
[00:21:43] news in all this is that nothing is set
[00:21:44] in stone and final at we are no code we
[00:21:46] changed our logo three different times
[00:21:48] so instead of trying to make you a
[00:21:50] designer in this section I'm going to
[00:21:51] talk to you about a couple of tools that
[00:21:53] you can use to actually build the first
[00:21:55] version of the brand that you're trying
[00:21:57] to launch and then I'm going to give you
[00:21:58] some tips because I've seen so many
[00:21:59] people get this completely wrong let's
[00:22:01] talk about what you need over here okay
[00:22:02] so let's talk about the elements that
[00:22:04] you're going to need to build out that
[00:22:05] first brand for the website first thing
[00:22:08] is going to be a logo now for the logo
[00:22:11] honestly my choice here would be to go
[00:22:14] to logo. a it's an AI tool that allows
[00:22:17] you to create logos and then you can
[00:22:19] basically pick one that you think is
[00:22:21] nice you can adapt it and you can pay a
[00:22:22] small amount of money to get access to
[00:22:24] the high resolution versions of it
[00:22:26] another tool I like using is Luca l Ka
[00:22:29] and this is another tool that will
[00:22:30] generate not only the logo but then it
[00:22:33] can also use that logo and create all
[00:22:35] sorts of branding elements and last but
[00:22:36] not least Fiverr and if you're going the
[00:22:38] Fiverr route I would find a portfolio
[00:22:40] find an exact logo that I like and just
[00:22:43] get them to adapt that logo to your
[00:22:45] specific brand name it's going to be the
[00:22:46] easiest way to really get the outcome
[00:22:48] you're looking for quickly and to be
[00:22:49] clear the logo should not take more than
[00:22:51] one to 5 days to create logo check the
[00:22:55] second element you're going to need is a
[00:22:56] color palette what are the main colors
[00:22:59] you really only need one core color and
[00:23:01] maybe one or two sub colors but we want
[00:23:03] to create a basic color palette color
[00:23:06] palette 1 L 2 L's 2 T's I don't know
[00:23:09] here I would simply use a website called
[00:23:10] coolers the other thing you could do is
[00:23:12] to go to a website that you like and
[00:23:14] simply use the two or three colors that
[00:23:16] you find pretty inside their design
[00:23:18] palette now each color usually has a hex
[00:23:20] code h e x this is basically a code very
[00:23:24] specific to that tone of that color and
[00:23:27] so you literally just want to have three
[00:23:29] different hex codes one being the main
[00:23:32] color that you're going to be using
[00:23:33] Facebook that would be blue for example
[00:23:35] and then you're going to want to have
[00:23:36] the two sub colors that you might use so
[00:23:38] potentially if you're using a blue you
[00:23:40] might use like a yellow but you can go
[00:23:42] and check out websites that inspire you
[00:23:44] and that's all we really have to do for
[00:23:46] a color palette keep it as simple as
[00:23:48] possible this going to take a lot of
[00:23:49] time and if you're not a designer just
[00:23:50] choose one color that's it with white
[00:23:52] now copywriting now let's talk about the
[00:23:55] copy we need to write copy behind
[00:23:57] everything that we do now that the tools
[00:23:58] that I use for copywriting would be as
[00:24:00] follows I would actually use Claude
[00:24:03] which is just a competitor to chat GPT
[00:24:05] it is completely free as well if you're
[00:24:07] using a tool like that you're going to
[00:24:08] want to give it a role for example you
[00:24:09] are a copywriter who writes landing
[00:24:12] pages for marketing material then a goal
[00:24:14] you're going to write the hero section
[00:24:16] for my onepage website then a specific
[00:24:19] set of instructions provide one headline
[00:24:22] and one subtype and of course you want
[00:24:24] to provide it with all the details of
[00:24:26] what your company does now the second
[00:24:27] tool that I really like to create copy
[00:24:29] is actually called reloom it's a
[00:24:32] components library and with AI it'll
[00:24:34] create the entire buildout we'll talk
[00:24:36] about this when we build the actual
[00:24:37] website but what it does is it also
[00:24:39] copyrights so it'll create a first
[00:24:42] version of the copy for the hero section
[00:24:44] for you simply by telling it what your
[00:24:47] company is that's reloom and the final
[00:24:48] one if you want to get a bit nerdier is
[00:24:50] going to be copy. a but for many people
[00:24:52] that's honestly a little bit Overkill so
[00:24:54] again we just need to write a couple of
[00:24:56] sections here check now we're also going
[00:24:58] to need things like icons illustrations
[00:25:01] which are basically drawings we're going
[00:25:03] to need pictures potentially if we want
[00:25:04] to use a lot of Photography within our
[00:25:06] website for this there are so many
[00:25:08] existing bases that you can use I use
[00:25:10] places like icon 8 when it comes to
[00:25:13] icons and illustrations as well for
[00:25:15] photography I would go with unsplash or
[00:25:17] pexels they have lots of free images
[00:25:19] that you can use for your website that
[00:25:21] are highly professional and if you want
[00:25:22] to get a bit nerdier with all this you
[00:25:23] can use AI obviously it will be a little
[00:25:25] bit more technical but I usually use
[00:25:27] things like mid Journey for visual
[00:25:29] elements and yes you'll find all the
[00:25:31] tools I'm talking about below inside of
[00:25:33] the description of this video and those
[00:25:35] are pretty much all of the elements that
[00:25:36] you need to build a first version of
[00:25:38] your brand now probably the most
[00:25:39] important here is to avoid perfectionism
[00:25:43] you are going to find yourself
[00:25:45] fine-tuning fine tuning and fine tuning
[00:25:47] you have to realize that it doesn't
[00:25:49] really matter how perfectly you get all
[00:25:51] these elements specifically the
[00:25:53] copywriting once you go and test this
[00:25:55] out you're going to get a much better
[00:25:57] idea you're going to learn from the
[00:25:58] market and you're going to want to
[00:25:59] anyway adapt some of the things the
[00:26:02] imagery the copyrighting and other
[00:26:04] elements as well and that can even
[00:26:05] include your logo to the reality of this
[00:26:08] phase is that nothing is final so don't
[00:26:10] be too too worried the main goal is not
[00:26:12] to get stuck in this phase now if you're
[00:26:14] not a designer and you have a terrible
[00:26:15] eye for these kind of things here are
[00:26:17] three key tips that have helped me
[00:26:18] number one if you don't know the color
[00:26:20] palette stick to white with one color
[00:26:23] Simplicity is always going to beat
[00:26:25] Overkill number two stick to only one
[00:26:27] style illustrations on a landing page or
[00:26:30] website so once you figured out the
[00:26:32] style you want to implement put that if
[00:26:34] it's a 3D style awesome if it's
[00:26:36] literally stick figures awesome just
[00:26:38] stick to one because if not it's going
[00:26:40] to make it look a little in congruent
[00:26:42] and the same thing stands for icons as
[00:26:43] well consistency matters and probably
[00:26:46] the best tip here is to use existing
[00:26:48] templates of designs use style guides
[00:26:50] that already are out there so you don't
[00:26:52] have to figure this thing out or which
[00:26:54] color goes well with which other one you
[00:26:56] can simply use pre-create ated elements
[00:26:59] that are going to be beautiful just to
[00:27:00] begin with now the whole goal of this
[00:27:01] branding module is literally so you can
[00:27:03] build that smoke test or website so
[00:27:05] let's talk about how we can do that with
[00:27:07] no code and AI okay so how do you build
[00:27:09] your website with no code and AI now for
[00:27:11] those of you who don't know what no code
[00:27:13] is it's a set of tools that allow you to
[00:27:15] drag and drop to build websites and apps
[00:27:18] as well without writing a single line of
[00:27:20] code and without understanding coding
[00:27:22] language there's code behind it but you
[00:27:24] don't have to touch it you can build
[00:27:25] beautiful things now there are two
[00:27:27] conflicting ideas when we're building a
[00:27:28] website one of which is that first
[00:27:31] impressions matter so building something
[00:27:32] nice is important but also nothing is
[00:27:35] perfect and it will always evolve and
[00:27:37] this is a work in progress so don't get
[00:27:39] too too caught up with this and it only
[00:27:40] takes looking at the first version of
[00:27:42] airbnb's website to realize that yes you
[00:27:45] can build awesome companies even if your
[00:27:47] first website is not the best so in this
[00:27:49] section we're going to keep it very
[00:27:50] simple and instead of building out a
[00:27:52] huge website with lots of different
[00:27:54] sections we're going to really focus in
[00:27:56] on building that onepage website which
[00:27:58] is the smoke test and over time you can
[00:28:00] build all sorts of things into it like a
[00:28:02] booking system or potentially a Blog but
[00:28:05] let's keep it simple for now now
[00:28:06] remember that at this point people don't
[00:28:07] care about you they care about
[00:28:09] themselves so getting the offer right
[00:28:11] and what that offer can actually do for
[00:28:13] them is the most important thing and I
[00:28:15] know we've already talked about this but
[00:28:16] if you haven't checked it out check out
[00:28:18] the beginning of this video where we
[00:28:19] jump into the structure but if you
[00:28:20] missed it check out the section about
[00:28:22] how to test out any startup idea now for
[00:28:24] this process I'll usually use some AI
[00:28:25] tools and then perfect everything in no
[00:28:27] code tools so I'll kick it off inside of
[00:28:29] reloom inside of reloom you can pretty
[00:28:31] much put your on line description it's
[00:28:34] going to actually create for you a full
[00:28:36] sit map which are basically the
[00:28:38] different pages again we're just doing
[00:28:39] one page for this example and then once
[00:28:41] you click on wireframe it builds it out
[00:28:43] into individual sections so as you can
[00:28:46] see from this example right here you can
[00:28:48] see every single section being populated
[00:28:50] and with this tool you can recreate this
[00:28:51] sections that you had now the most
[00:28:53] important thing here is that you are
[00:28:54] creating the structure and how it looks
[00:28:56] you can adapt that and then we're
[00:28:58] actually going to want to build it out
[00:29:00] so if you were using reloom we can
[00:29:02] either choose to then push that reloom
[00:29:05] wireframe inside of web flow which is a
[00:29:08] website builder now this is for slightly
[00:29:10] more technical people because web flow
[00:29:12] does require a couple months to become
[00:29:14] very good at if you want to keep it
[00:29:15] simple you can definitely do it this way
[00:29:17] as well the second tool I would
[00:29:18] recommend would be card with two RS it
[00:29:20] is very cheap to build out your website
[00:29:22] and once you've created that wireframe
[00:29:24] you have a good idea of the structure of
[00:29:25] your website you want to build that
[00:29:27] structure and actual code which is why
[00:29:29] we're going towards these no code tools
[00:29:31] card is awesome and it's very flexible
[00:29:33] it's very easy to learn as well and now
[00:29:35] if you already know that you're going to
[00:29:36] build a web app behind this product then
[00:29:38] you can start off with software if you'd
[00:29:40] like because software will allow you to
[00:29:42] build the landing page but then also you
[00:29:44] can use those learnings to be able to
[00:29:46] then build out a web app as well those
[00:29:47] are my recommendations but honestly
[00:29:49] there are thousands of website Builders
[00:29:50] and at this point even email marketing
[00:29:52] tools allow you to build basic landing
[00:29:54] pages and so the most important is for
[00:29:56] you to build out the actual structure
[00:29:58] that we've talked about earlier and then
[00:30:00] to input all of the elements that you
[00:30:02] have inside The Branding and content
[00:30:04] section that pretty much means the
[00:30:06] copyrighting that you might have from
[00:30:08] reloom or from one of the other tools
[00:30:09] that we talked about then you're going
[00:30:11] to want to input the icons illustrations
[00:30:14] if you have photography you're going to
[00:30:15] want to fine-tune that uh call to action
[00:30:18] button and when it comes to building out
[00:30:19] a website there are three tips that
[00:30:21] really helped me along the way and I
[00:30:23] want to share these with you right now
[00:30:24] the first tip I would recommend is to
[00:30:26] highly customize this Tut Target your
[00:30:28] ideal customer profile or the person you
[00:30:30] think you're going after don't make your
[00:30:32] copyrighting general make it incredibly
[00:30:34] specific for that person have this thing
[00:30:36] feel like you're talking directly to
[00:30:38] them and not to kind of this broad
[00:30:40] audience it's like this is for yoga
[00:30:43] teachers in San Francisco who have this
[00:30:46] problem and you're they feel understood
[00:30:48] and this is something that's going to
[00:30:49] connect with them a lot more than really
[00:30:52] Broad and general text and with that you
[00:30:53] want to make sure that you don't have
[00:30:55] jargon that everything's written very
[00:30:57] simply so very easy to understand if
[00:31:00] there is specific jargon that has to do
[00:31:02] with that ideal customer profile that
[00:31:03] you're targeting then it's okay to use
[00:31:05] words like that for example in the
[00:31:06] startup world people kind of generally
[00:31:08] know what an MVP is so if you were
[00:31:10] targeting people who are startup
[00:31:11] Founders you might call something an MVP
[00:31:14] the second big tip I have for you is to
[00:31:16] learn how to build it out yourself
[00:31:18] because you're going to have to change
[00:31:19] this website so many times as you change
[00:31:22] the offer as you learn more about who
[00:31:24] your customer is what the benefits are
[00:31:26] that they're looking for having the
[00:31:27] knowledge to actually change it yourself
[00:31:29] will give you a lot of flexibility and
[00:31:31] control early on number three is do not
[00:31:34] strive for Perfection you will never
[00:31:35] reach it it is okay for you to build
[00:31:37] something 80% of where you want it and
[00:31:39] then to launch it and fourth probably
[00:31:41] the most important point is to start
[00:31:43] adapting your website or landing page to
[00:31:46] the customer and to the needs that they
[00:31:48] actually have so the quicker you can
[00:31:50] fine-tune this the better it is going to
[00:31:52] be at selling your product and your
[00:31:54] offer and just to be clear building your
[00:31:55] first website should definitely not take
[00:31:57] more than 2 to 7 days if it takes you
[00:31:59] longer than that you are probably stuck
[00:32:01] in analysis paralysis or perfectionism
[00:32:04] and this is why in this next section I
[00:32:05] want to talk about the entrepreneurship
[00:32:07] mindset how important it is for you to
[00:32:09] adopt this mindset if you want to be
[00:32:11] successful as a startup founder now
[00:32:13] probably one of the biggest differences
[00:32:15] that you're going to go through when you
[00:32:16] go from a 9 to-5 job to becoming a
[00:32:19] full-time entrepreneur is in your
[00:32:21] mindset and I used to think the mindset
[00:32:22] was super fluffy but as I've trained
[00:32:24] more and more Founders I realized how
[00:32:26] essential it is to get this part right
[00:32:28] so that you can really set yourself up
[00:32:30] to win in the long term so I want to
[00:32:32] teach you how to build a solid mindset
[00:32:34] because early stage building a startup
[00:32:36] when you're going literally from I have
[00:32:38] an idea or no idea to First paying
[00:32:41] customers it is completely different
[00:32:43] than having a 95 it's completely
[00:32:45] different than joining a startup in the
[00:32:46] early stages and helping them grow and
[00:32:49] this stands for low-level employees but
[00:32:50] also for very high level Executives you
[00:32:53] see when you're an executive at a high
[00:32:55] level you have access to all these
[00:32:56] different teams and you you are
[00:32:58] basically a manager right if you have an
[00:33:00] issue or you need something from design
[00:33:01] you can just call up a designer if you
[00:33:03] need some help from marketing call up
[00:33:05] marketing you have all these resources
[00:33:07] and Specialists that you have access to
[00:33:08] and when you are building a startup it's
[00:33:10] often times just you and potentially one
[00:33:12] co-founder who are trying to do
[00:33:14] everything themselves with a very
[00:33:17] limited budget and usually not a huge
[00:33:20] amount of time either so understanding
[00:33:21] how to operate in these two very
[00:33:23] different scenarios can be a change the
[00:33:25] first big change has to do with going
[00:33:27] from being a specialist to having to
[00:33:29] learn the basics of several different
[00:33:32] skills to be able to get things off the
[00:33:34] ground and then to be able to replace
[00:33:36] yourself in those areas once you have
[00:33:39] more time and resources and so in those
[00:33:41] circumstances learning how to become a
[00:33:43] beginner again and to accept that in
[00:33:45] entrepreneurship you are a beginner and
[00:33:47] you have to learn all of these different
[00:33:49] things this is actually going to allow
[00:33:51] you to very quickly adopt this new
[00:33:53] mindset adopt this new operating system
[00:33:56] so that you can be more successful and
[00:33:57] so it's completely okay that you don't
[00:33:58] know a bunch of things but all you have
[00:34:00] to do is add yet to the end of that
[00:34:02] sentence and basically you start
[00:34:04] adopting this growth mentality that by
[00:34:06] the way is pulled from a book called
[00:34:08] mindset from Carl DWI and yes believing
[00:34:10] that you can grow no matter where you
[00:34:12] are in your journey is so so important
[00:34:14] so that you can adopt that beginner
[00:34:16] mindset learn the skills you need and
[00:34:18] then be able to launch startups from
[00:34:20] scratch now I'm a big believer that
[00:34:21] entrepreneurship is a learned skill sure
[00:34:24] some people are more extroverted and
[00:34:26] they might be better at going out there
[00:34:27] in doing sales some people might be
[00:34:29] better at Building Products than others
[00:34:30] and some people have a higher tolerance
[00:34:32] for risk than others but having trained
[00:34:33] more than 600 Founders I can tell you
[00:34:35] that it's more of a skill and it's a
[00:34:37] skill that you can learn through action
[00:34:39] and this leads us to a very important
[00:34:41] next point is that in entrepreneurship
[00:34:43] especially at these very early stages
[00:34:45] you need to take action over Perfection
[00:34:47] so although in your day job you might be
[00:34:49] so used to creating things to Perfection
[00:34:51] the best of your ability this is
[00:34:53] actually something that's going to slow
[00:34:54] you down because of the simple parto
[00:34:57] principle right
[00:34:58] 20% of your effort is going to get 80%
[00:35:01] of the outcome so that last 20% from
[00:35:03] going to good to perfect is not worth
[00:35:06] your time in early stage
[00:35:07] entrepreneurship and that's because
[00:35:08] you're running a bunch of tests and
[00:35:10] things are constantly changing and a lot
[00:35:12] of the work you're doing might have to
[00:35:13] be redone completely so it's important
[00:35:15] is to take action do tasks at 80% of
[00:35:18] your ability and then move on to the
[00:35:20] next task because they're going to be
[00:35:22] many tasks that you have to do and you
[00:35:23] have no time to get lost in Endless
[00:35:25] perfectionism now one of the core
[00:35:26] reasons why this all happens is because
[00:35:29] for some reason in entrepreneurship we
[00:35:31] take what we do as who we are so if you
[00:35:36] create a task that is not perfect that
[00:35:38] means that you are not perfect if a
[00:35:40] product you launch is not amazing then
[00:35:42] it means that you are not amazing and if
[00:35:44] we detach our production from our
[00:35:48] identity it suddenly gives us what we
[00:35:50] really need in entrepreneurship which is
[00:35:52] a mentality of the scientist we're just
[00:35:54] building things to test them out see if
[00:35:56] they work out if they they do perfect we
[00:35:58] can invest more time in perfecting them
[00:36:00] over time but usually there's going to
[00:36:01] be a much more pressing task to go after
[00:36:04] next so you are not your startup and
[00:36:06] it's okay to deliver work at 80% of your
[00:36:09] capability I'm telling you that now you
[00:36:11] need to adopt this now another big
[00:36:13] problem that early stage entrepreneurs
[00:36:14] have is that they are constantly lost in
[00:36:16] analysis paralysis constantly doing
[00:36:19] research constantly overthinking things
[00:36:21] doing research planning and not actually
[00:36:24] executing towards their goal and that's
[00:36:26] usually because they fall in love and
[00:36:28] engage in their Vision their dream this
[00:36:30] large company this amazing platform that
[00:36:33] they're going to build that's going to
[00:36:34] change the world instead of focusing in
[00:36:37] on that one tiny task that they can do
[00:36:41] today that's going to allow you to
[00:36:43] progress towards that end goal and
[00:36:45] that's a huge mental shift because we're
[00:36:47] always asked what is your Grand Vision
[00:36:49] what is this amazing business that
[00:36:51] you're going to build and all you really
[00:36:53] need to figure out at the moment is kind
[00:36:55] of have an idea of the direction that
[00:36:56] you're going and then take the steps
[00:36:59] that will shine light onto the next
[00:37:01] steps meaning that right now you don't
[00:37:03] know what you're going to have to do in
[00:37:04] 3 months because you don't know the
[00:37:05] results of the experiments you're going
[00:37:07] to do between now and then and I love
[00:37:09] this quote that I heard which is it's
[00:37:11] easy to hide behind large visions and
[00:37:13] dreams it is very difficult to hide
[00:37:16] behind small individual tasks so spend
[00:37:19] more time figuring out the small tasks
[00:37:21] you can do instead of always obsessing
[00:37:23] over this Grand Vision and the strategy
[00:37:25] and the plan okay now let's talk about
[00:37:26] marshmallows yes this has to do with
[00:37:28] mindset you see there was a study that
[00:37:30] was done where they took a bunch of kids
[00:37:32] and they put one marshmallow in front of
[00:37:33] them and they said if you can wait 30
[00:37:35] minutes without eating this marshmallow
[00:37:37] then we will give you a second
[00:37:39] marshmallow and then they tracked how
[00:37:40] successful these people were in their
[00:37:42] life now interestingly enough the group
[00:37:44] of kids that waited the 30 minutes to
[00:37:46] get the second marshmallow actually also
[00:37:48] ended up being much more successful in
[00:37:51] life and that's because they learned how
[00:37:52] to delay gratification and this is maybe
[00:37:55] the most important piece of advice for
[00:37:57] mindset within entrepreneurship it's
[00:37:59] that the actions that you're taking
[00:38:00] today you don't always see the result of
[00:38:03] them immediately so engaging in
[00:38:05] immediate action and expecting the
[00:38:08] results of your actions to be shown in
[00:38:10] the future AKA delaying gratification is
[00:38:12] what's going to make you win over time
[00:38:14] so be incredibly impatient in action but
[00:38:17] also be very patient in results Great
[00:38:20] businesses usually take about 2 years to
[00:38:22] build 3 years to build and they're
[00:38:24] actually sold after like 7 to 10 years
[00:38:27] so be the entrepreneur that plays the
[00:38:29] long game because it is in the long game
[00:38:30] that you can win really big learn the
[00:38:33] process acquire the skills and you're
[00:38:35] setting yourself up to have so many
[00:38:36] shots on go that it's almost impossible
[00:38:38] that you not succeed in entrepreneurship
[00:38:40] however if you expect immediate results
[00:38:42] you will be disappointed and
[00:38:43] unfortunately this is probably not made
[00:38:45] for you now one of the most amazing
[00:38:47] quotes I want to leave you with right
[00:38:48] now is as follows the magic you are
[00:38:50] looking for is in the work you are
[00:38:53] avoiding now this is so important for
[00:38:56] entrepreneurship because often times we
[00:38:58] have to do things that we don't want to
[00:39:00] do the obstacle is the path and often
[00:39:02] times we don't want to do things that
[00:39:04] are uncomfortable but this is literally
[00:39:06] what we have to do so if we are more of
[00:39:08] a builder a programmer we're going to
[00:39:10] have to learn how to do some sales to
[00:39:12] talk to customers if we're more of a
[00:39:14] salesperson we will have to learn how to
[00:39:16] do some of the building especially early
[00:39:18] stage or at least to be able to manage
[00:39:20] our own stack and adapt it to product
[00:39:22] Market fit so whether you're at the
[00:39:23] beginning of your journey or deep in the
[00:39:25] entrepreneurship trenches remember that
[00:39:28] the magic you are looking for is in the
[00:39:31] work you're avoiding and with that let's
[00:39:33] jump into the next section okay so let's
[00:39:35] talk about how to build your first app
[00:39:37] or MVP with no code tools now every time
[00:39:40] I speak to entrepreneurs they often
[00:39:42] times have a mountain of different
[00:39:44] features that they're trying to fit into
[00:39:46] the first version of the app they
[00:39:47] released and this usually makes them
[00:39:49] build products that look a little bit
[00:39:51] like this one but it's so so important
[00:39:53] to know that the first product you
[00:39:55] launch the product that can get you to
[00:39:57] millions of dollars in Revenue usually
[00:39:59] looks something like this so stop
[00:40:01] building out a million features and
[00:40:03] focus on delivering value to your
[00:40:06] customer customers pay for the value
[00:40:08] your product delivers not the product
[00:40:10] itself in fact customers don't care
[00:40:12] about your blockchain technology your AI
[00:40:15] your machine learning they really care
[00:40:17] about the outcome that this can provide
[00:40:19] for them and so the number one goal is
[00:40:20] to build the smallest product which
[00:40:23] delivers the most amount of value or
[00:40:25] outcome to your customer now because we
[00:40:27] know that your first app is not going to
[00:40:29] be your last and that it's a work in
[00:40:31] progress and that we also know we're
[00:40:32] going to have to adapt it to the market
[00:40:34] realities we need to launch this product
[00:40:36] yesterday and in the wise words of Paul
[00:40:38] Graham who's the founder of Y combinator
[00:40:40] if you don't feel uncomfortable about
[00:40:42] the first product you launch you are
[00:40:44] launching too late so let's talk about
[00:40:45] the right and the wrong way of building
[00:40:47] an MVP okay so if we're trying to solve
[00:40:49] the transportation problem here is the
[00:40:51] wrong way of building your MVP why is
[00:40:54] that the case well cuz as you can see
[00:40:56] the first iteration is two wheels it
[00:40:58] doesn't actually get you from one place
[00:40:59] to the other quicker the half of a car
[00:41:03] doesn't either and you literally have to
[00:41:04] spend a bunch of money to build the car
[00:41:07] so only the last iteration of this
[00:41:09] product solves the problem and people
[00:41:11] are willing to pay for however this over
[00:41:13] here is the correct way to build a
[00:41:15] startup because as you can see building
[00:41:17] a skateboard is going to be a very first
[00:41:20] version that solves the problem it's
[00:41:21] quicker than walking a bicycle is going
[00:41:23] to be quicker than the product before it
[00:41:25] and then we build a car afterwards now
[00:41:27] we can charge more and more over time
[00:41:29] for improving the product and for
[00:41:32] delivering the better and better outcome
[00:41:34] right but each one of these products
[00:41:36] allow you to generate money and it
[00:41:38] solves the actual problem and this is
[00:41:40] the approach that you want to take when
[00:41:42] you're building your MVP so let's talk
[00:41:44] about the steps we have to do to build
[00:41:46] this MVP there are actually three key
[00:41:47] questions that we have before we even
[00:41:49] start building number one is what is the
[00:41:53] outcome that the customer wants so for
[00:41:57] example if our product is Airbnb the
[00:41:59] outcome is a rented house if the product
[00:42:02] is an analytics platform then the
[00:42:04] outcome is a report and insight and if
[00:42:06] the product is a dating app going on a
[00:42:08] date is the outcome that people are
[00:42:10] paying for they don't care if it's an
[00:42:12] app the thing they care the most about
[00:42:13] is the ultimate outcome and figuring out
[00:42:16] how to deliver that outcome with the
[00:42:17] fewest features to build is your job so
[00:42:19] number two is figuring out the minimum
[00:42:22] number of features that you need to be
[00:42:25] able to
[00:42:27] build out that mvp or deliver the
[00:42:30] outcome right and part of it could be a
[00:42:32] software product another part of it
[00:42:34] could also be done manually at first
[00:42:35] there was a great startup that delivered
[00:42:37] ma services at your home and all you did
[00:42:39] you logged in and you basically sent
[00:42:41] through a request and the founders would
[00:42:43] actually just then text one of their
[00:42:46] made services and see if they were
[00:42:47] available send them to destination send
[00:42:49] a confirmation by text to the customer
[00:42:51] and it was a smart way to build a
[00:42:53] minimal front end and then have a back
[00:42:55] end that was manually managed managed
[00:42:57] and then of course they built out that
[00:42:59] back end to be able to manage way more
[00:43:01] people booking this is really the kind
[00:43:02] of thing that we're looking for early on
[00:43:04] cuz remember outcome equals money and
[00:43:07] this is the ultimate validator of your
[00:43:09] startup and step three is which tools do
[00:43:12] we have to choose right to be able to
[00:43:14] build out the features that deliver the
[00:43:17] outcome now for this we're going to be
[00:43:19] talking about a couple of tools here I'm
[00:43:20] going to bring you through the process
[00:43:21] and don't worry none of these tools
[00:43:23] require you to be a technical person or
[00:43:25] have programming skills to be able to to
[00:43:27] build they're all again going to be
[00:43:28] built with these Drag and Drop app
[00:43:30] Builders called No code tools now once
[00:43:31] you figure these things out the first
[00:43:33] step is going to be to have a wireframe
[00:43:35] built or basically a flowchart the
[00:43:37] wireframe are all of the different
[00:43:39] screens that you think this app or this
[00:43:41] product is going to need and the
[00:43:43] flowchart is how they connect to each
[00:43:45] other you can literally build these out
[00:43:46] on a napkin right now or a piece of
[00:43:48] paper with a pen that just organizes
[00:43:50] your ideas and the way that you see this
[00:43:52] working out there are also a couple of
[00:43:53] AI tools that are very valuable and will
[00:43:55] save you probably a lot of time I use a
[00:43:57] tool called
[00:44:00] galileo.com
[00:44:03] and there's also another tool called
[00:44:05] uard or wizard that allows you to do a
[00:44:08] similar thing on the design front now if
[00:44:10] you don't know how a flowchart works or
[00:44:12] how to create a wireframe then you can
[00:44:14] literally do two things you can ask chat
[00:44:17] GPT to actually draw one out for you you
[00:44:20] can also go and Google it and just find
[00:44:22] an example of an existing flowchart and
[00:44:25] then just adapt it to what your app does
[00:44:27] and because with no code tools you can
[00:44:28] build these things out relatively
[00:44:30] quickly what's important in this
[00:44:32] preparation phase is to really get
[00:44:34] everything down on paper and mapped out
[00:44:37] so you can have better preparation for
[00:44:39] when it comes to building it out now
[00:44:40] I've helped more than 600 people build
[00:44:42] out their apps with no code and Ai and
[00:44:45] this is why I'm just going to give you
[00:44:46] some of the tool sets that I think will
[00:44:48] be a good fit for you now if possible
[00:44:50] and if you don't have a lot of
[00:44:51] experience building out apps then I
[00:44:53] highly recommend that you build a first
[00:44:54] version of your MVP leveraging softare
[00:44:57] as a front end or building all the
[00:44:59] design side and then air table which
[00:45:01] stores all of the data or in other words
[00:45:04] your database and the reason why I
[00:45:05] recommend this stack is because it is
[00:45:07] easier to learn and it can also build
[00:45:09] out deeper functionalities than just a
[00:45:11] website now if you're a total beginner
[00:45:12] but you're looking to build something
[00:45:13] that's a little bit more of like a
[00:45:15] mobile app then I would highly recommend
[00:45:17] you check out Glide um it doesn't
[00:45:20] actually go into the IOS and Android
[00:45:22] store but it has a really good web
[00:45:24] experience and it's a very easy tool to
[00:45:26] learn now if your app absolutely
[00:45:28] requires for you to have deeper
[00:45:29] functionalities do all sorts of API
[00:45:32] calls and has more complicated um
[00:45:35] workflows then you probably want to
[00:45:37] consider one of two tools the first one
[00:45:39] is bubble uh and the second one is
[00:45:42] flutter flow now heads up here these
[00:45:44] platforms usually take about 3 to 6
[00:45:46] months to get good at before you can
[00:45:47] build a solid version of your first app
[00:45:50] but with that learning curve will come
[00:45:51] more flexibility and power so now let me
[00:45:53] give you some tips that are going to
[00:45:54] Fast Track your journey number one build
[00:45:56] a simple software product and then do
[00:45:59] some of the things that are more
[00:46:00] complicated manually at first just for
[00:46:02] the couple first customers so you can
[00:46:04] get a much better idea of how that thing
[00:46:06] actually has to be built out and if
[00:46:08] something doesn't work you can easily
[00:46:09] adapt it instead of unbuilding
[00:46:11] everything that you've created your goal
[00:46:13] is to get as quickly as possible to
[00:46:14] revenue because that's what tells you
[00:46:16] that you're really on the right path
[00:46:18] number two expect to be wrong with the
[00:46:20] first product that you build why because
[00:46:22] most people are so in love with their
[00:46:24] ideas that they can't and don't have the
[00:46:27] ability to actually shift and pivot
[00:46:30] towards the Market's demand instead
[00:46:32] learn how to build that first product
[00:46:34] yourself so that you have full control
[00:46:37] you're never going to be a slave to
[00:46:38] programmers bills over and over and over
[00:46:41] and you can control and find product
[00:46:43] Market fit over time this is where
[00:46:45] learning no code tools and startup
[00:46:47] methodology is so powerful it makes you
[00:46:50] a self-reliant entrepreneur and It
[00:46:51] ultimately allows you to have more shots
[00:46:53] on goal now the final thing is that
[00:46:55] Founders put way too much emphasis on
[00:46:57] the launch of their product they think
[00:46:59] Leonardo DiCaprio is going to show up
[00:47:01] and everyone's going to be cheering
[00:47:02] champagne glasses and everyone's going
[00:47:04] to come and be so excited about their
[00:47:06] product guess what I hate to break it to
[00:47:08] you but no one cares in fact Airbnb
[00:47:10] launched like four times before they
[00:47:12] were successful so what's more important
[00:47:14] is for you to get the product in front
[00:47:16] of the first couple of customers get
[00:47:18] feedback and improve it for the next
[00:47:20] couple customers and that is how you
[00:47:21] should launch your MVP but a product is
[00:47:24] nothing without a business model which
[00:47:26] is why in this next section we're going
[00:47:27] to be talking about how to select the
[00:47:29] right one for your business okay so
[00:47:31] let's talk about how to pick the right
[00:47:32] business model for your startup now
[00:47:36] you'll be surprised to know that there
[00:47:37] are actually only 14 proven business
[00:47:39] models in the digital world so all you
[00:47:41] really have to do is listen to this
[00:47:43] section till the end and select one
[00:47:45] which you think has the highest
[00:47:47] likelihood of being the one for you then
[00:47:49] we're going to go out there and test it
[00:47:51] and move on if we're right we're going
[00:47:52] to double down if we're not we're going
[00:47:53] to select a different one and I say that
[00:47:55] because you should only have one one
[00:47:57] business model to launch your startup
[00:47:59] sure when you've generated millions of
[00:48:01] dollars you can have more than one and
[00:48:04] actually at scale it's proven that there
[00:48:05] are usually about two but your ability
[00:48:07] to make money with one is the most
[00:48:09] important thing for you in these early
[00:48:10] stages so let me break down each for you
[00:48:12] right now and give you a short example
[00:48:14] the first one is services or fee for
[00:48:16] service so this one is very simple a
[00:48:19] consulting firm for example they provide
[00:48:21] you with services and you pay for those
[00:48:24] Services you're either charged on a per
[00:48:26] project basis which is usually the case
[00:48:27] or sometimes it's hourly number two
[00:48:30] Commerce selling physical or digital
[00:48:32] products right you buy them for a
[00:48:34] certain price you sell them for a
[00:48:35] certain price you make your money in
[00:48:37] between relatively simple let's move on
[00:48:40] to the next the third one is what many
[00:48:41] software businesses use which is a
[00:48:43] subscription you pay a monthly fee to
[00:48:46] get access to a service this could be
[00:48:48] something like Netflix or it could be
[00:48:50] something like your CRM and one of the
[00:48:51] great things about this is that you get
[00:48:53] recurring Revenue so it's a obviously a
[00:48:55] very popular model number four is
[00:48:57] something that is so popular now that AI
[00:48:59] has become the next big thing and it is
[00:49:01] metered services so you basically pay
[00:49:04] per usage right you have a certain
[00:49:06] number of tokens and that's what you get
[00:49:08] access to and if you want more you got
[00:49:09] to pay more but this is the same thing
[00:49:11] as buying servers from AWS for example
[00:49:14] it's basically you pay for the amount
[00:49:15] that you use and yes you charge people
[00:49:17] more than what it costs you to run
[00:49:20] number five productized services this is
[00:49:23] basically when you take what usually is
[00:49:25] a manual service based business and you
[00:49:28] create products that are able to deliver
[00:49:31] the value of those same services online
[00:49:34] Moz is a great example of this business
[00:49:35] model and in fact when building with no
[00:49:37] code so many of our students are trying
[00:49:39] to do that right they have skills and
[00:49:41] now they want to charge people for those
[00:49:42] skills and build it into a product it's
[00:49:45] basically taking knoow and services
[00:49:47] based businesses turning them into
[00:49:49] products that are more scalable number
[00:49:50] six is a transaction fee so exactly in
[00:49:53] the same way that Airbnb does it right
[00:49:55] you charge someone you basically help a
[00:49:58] transaction take place and then you just
[00:49:59] take a cut of that transaction so it
[00:50:02] could also be like Kickstarter right
[00:50:04] take a 5 to 15% Fee number seven lead
[00:50:08] generation but basically here is where
[00:50:10] you acquire leads and you sell them to
[00:50:13] other providers so basically like
[00:50:15] creditcards.com you can either charge
[00:50:17] per lead or you can also charge for any
[00:50:19] lead that was closed number eight is
[00:50:22] games so it's basically either ingame
[00:50:24] purchases or actually purchasing the
[00:50:26] game itself a good example of this is
[00:50:28] fortnite for example the very popular
[00:50:31] video game then there's marketplaces
[00:50:32] which for me is the same as transaction
[00:50:34] fees right you connect a buyer and a
[00:50:36] seller and you take a commission so
[00:50:37] think of like eBay for example number 10
[00:50:39] is ADS so just like Google you basically
[00:50:41] sell ad placement for companies to
[00:50:44] Market their products 11 is called New
[00:50:46] Media and it's basically having a viral
[00:50:49] effect so this for me is not really a
[00:50:50] business model but it's like it
[00:50:52] definitely if you have lots of people
[00:50:54] and there's huge growth like WhatsApp
[00:50:56] then obviously you have some power
[00:50:57] because you have a lot of users number
[00:50:59] 12 is combinations so you might have a
[00:51:01] subscription fee and then you also have
[00:51:03] Services I would call this kind having
[00:51:04] two business models but hey who am I
[00:51:06] number 13 is Big Data basically selling
[00:51:09] people's information online number 14 is
[00:51:12] licensing like Microsoft sells its
[00:51:14] licenses which is basically the right to
[00:51:16] use their intellectual property and at
[00:51:18] this point if it's not so clear which
[00:51:20] one is a good fit for you you should
[00:51:22] actually just go to chat GPT and ask it
[00:51:25] describe your company and tell it to
[00:51:27] give you the right business model for
[00:51:29] what you are trying to accomplish so the
[00:51:30] main advice here is don't be creative
[00:51:33] use one of these and just implement it
[00:51:35] in your business and please please
[00:51:37] please only have one business model to
[00:51:39] start okay now in this next section
[00:51:40] we're going to be talking about how to
[00:51:42] sell so in this section let's talk about
[00:51:44] how to sell selling is probably the
[00:51:47] single most important skill that every
[00:51:50] single entrepreneur should learn and no
[00:51:52] matter what business you are starting
[00:51:54] you need to learn it to have control of
[00:51:56] your company but I know a lot of you
[00:51:57] might think hey I'm not really a sales
[00:51:59] guy because you have that idea of the
[00:52:01] used car salesman guy but in this
[00:52:03] section I'm going to teach you why you
[00:52:04] don't have to become an aggressive
[00:52:05] salesperson to be able to close great
[00:52:08] business you see putting the right offer
[00:52:10] in front of the right person at the
[00:52:13] right time is ultimately what closes
[00:52:15] deals and suddenly you don't have to
[00:52:17] push your product onto people people
[00:52:19] sell themselves into your product but
[00:52:21] you need to understand a lot of the
[00:52:23] different mechanisms that go in the
[00:52:25] buyer journey to be able to sell
[00:52:27] effectively and going through the
[00:52:28] experience of selling yourself early on
[00:52:30] will literally teach you how to build
[00:52:32] every single part of your business
[00:52:34] because guess what all the objections
[00:52:36] that you're getting while you're selling
[00:52:38] are going to be things that you have to
[00:52:39] include in your marketing material on
[00:52:41] your website all the outcomes and the
[00:52:43] benefits people are looking for again
[00:52:45] you're going to discover through the
[00:52:46] sales process and you're going to focus
[00:52:48] on those talking points when you go out
[00:52:50] and try to sell but because a lot of
[00:52:51] people don't like this topic I'm going
[00:52:52] to start off with some difficult stuff
[00:52:54] let's say that you have to do actual
[00:52:56] sales in-person sales well let me break
[00:52:58] down this very simple framework it's
[00:53:00] actually Alex Heros if you know him it's
[00:53:02] the closer framework and you're going to
[00:53:03] see it's actually not that difficult and
[00:53:05] you can do it even if you are an
[00:53:06] introvert and even if you're not a fan
[00:53:08] of Alex this is useful information to
[00:53:10] have now this is actually a question
[00:53:11] based framework which basically means
[00:53:13] that you're asking a bunch of questions
[00:53:14] and you're not necessarily going hard on
[00:53:17] the pitching side of things so the C
[00:53:18] stands for clarify so you can ask your
[00:53:21] prospect questions like what brought you
[00:53:23] to this call today what is your goal
[00:53:25] they're basically going to explain to
[00:53:27] you what their problem is the L over
[00:53:29] here stands for label so as soon as you
[00:53:32] know the problem you want to really
[00:53:33] label the problem so labeling you
[00:53:35] basically repeat what the person says so
[00:53:37] I understand that your problem seems to
[00:53:39] be this x right or uh it sounds like
[00:53:42] your goal is this correct now once they
[00:53:44] say yes you know that is the pain now
[00:53:46] before we actually present a solution
[00:53:48] and try to solve their problem we need
[00:53:49] to understand the pain itself right so o
[00:53:51] is overview of past pains so questions
[00:53:53] like what have you tried so far how long
[00:53:56] long have you been doing that for is
[00:53:57] that working out for you things like
[00:53:59] that basically it brings them back into
[00:54:01] a little bit the pain that they're
[00:54:02] currently feeling and it sets you up
[00:54:04] really well to go in and start selling
[00:54:06] your solution so here we basically want
[00:54:08] to just focus on the three benefits so
[00:54:11] the three outcomes that people are
[00:54:12] actually looking for in using your
[00:54:14] product and kind of explaining why this
[00:54:16] will be able to solve the past pains
[00:54:19] that they've had then e is explain the
[00:54:21] concerns away these are basically all
[00:54:23] around objections right when you try to
[00:54:26] sell something people have all these
[00:54:27] objections around the product that
[00:54:29] you're trying to sell and this is where
[00:54:30] you address all of these objections so
[00:54:33] usually it's it's too expensive I need
[00:54:34] to consult someone else what you want to
[00:54:36] do here is reframe the way that they're
[00:54:38] thinking about that specific concern and
[00:54:40] then once you've actually closed it
[00:54:42] comes to the r down here which is to
[00:54:44] reinforce their decision so now they've
[00:54:46] bought and you want to reinforce the
[00:54:49] decision that they've made so they can
[00:54:50] feel good about their decision so for
[00:54:52] example when people join our program I
[00:54:54] will actually send each person an
[00:54:56] individual video personalized to what
[00:54:59] they're trying to accomplish to help
[00:55:01] them be able to drive the outcome that
[00:55:02] they're looking for a handwritten note
[00:55:04] is something that you could do you could
[00:55:05] send them a box with swag inside of it
[00:55:07] there's lots of options that you can use
[00:55:09] but with selling the most important
[00:55:10] thing is the Insight that you get from
[00:55:13] selling which are things that are going
[00:55:15] to allow you to build an amazing
[00:55:16] business right because ultimately you're
[00:55:19] understanding the problems the solutions
[00:55:21] that people are looking for and
[00:55:23] hopefully you're building a product that
[00:55:24] actually solves this problem too and and
[00:55:26] by the way don't expect to be the best
[00:55:28] at this at first go out there and start
[00:55:29] selling and then you basically fine-tune
[00:55:31] from there again action over Perfection
[00:55:34] you can perfect these things over time
[00:55:36] and one thing that's really stuck with
[00:55:37] me is that people make purchasing
[00:55:39] decisions emotionally but then they
[00:55:41] justify them logically so make sure that
[00:55:43] the way that you sell your product is
[00:55:45] based on the outcomes because that's
[00:55:47] going to get a person in a good
[00:55:49] emotional state to be looking for that
[00:55:51] solution and then you're going to be
[00:55:52] able to close the deal by addressing
[00:55:54] logically all the concerns that these
[00:55:56] individuals have and both of those
[00:55:58] together can be very powerful but now
[00:56:00] that you know the basics about selling
[00:56:01] how do you actually get those first
[00:56:03] paying customers right well we're going
[00:56:05] to talk about that in the next section
[00:56:06] getting your first paying customers is
[00:56:09] something that is completely different
[00:56:11] than building scalable marketing
[00:56:13] strategies which we're going to be
[00:56:14] talking about in the next section but
[00:56:15] everything that you'll be implementing
[00:56:17] in building scalable strategies are
[00:56:19] things that you are learning in this
[00:56:20] first step and one of the best quotes
[00:56:23] here is that early on in startups you
[00:56:25] are doing things that are are not
[00:56:26] scalable because it provides you with
[00:56:28] the Insight that you need to be able to
[00:56:30] build out scalable processes now in
[00:56:32] startups when we talk about sales we
[00:56:34] really talk about first 100 customers
[00:56:36] how do you find them but then also how
[00:56:38] do you actually sell to them and if
[00:56:39] right now you're thinking well I don't
[00:56:40] know how to reach my customers then it
[00:56:43] doesn't even matter if you build this
[00:56:44] whole business out if you're not able to
[00:56:46] reach them you're going to be in the
[00:56:47] same situation once you've built out
[00:56:49] this entire product anyway why because
[00:56:51] people will not just come flooding
[00:56:52] towards your product you will have to
[00:56:54] actively go out and find to those first
[00:56:57] customers and usually it's a very manual
[00:56:59] process but again it's going to allow
[00:57:01] you to create amazing scalable systems
[00:57:03] later now the first customers that you
[00:57:05] will ever get will most likely come from
[00:57:08] the same group of people that you talk
[00:57:10] to during the customer Discovery Journey
[00:57:12] you see when you were doing customer
[00:57:13] interviews you were having a
[00:57:14] conversation where you asking people
[00:57:16] about their problems but guess what you
[00:57:18] were also doing you were building a
[00:57:19] relationship with these people and
[00:57:21] potentially at the end of that interview
[00:57:23] you talked a little bit about what you
[00:57:24] were trying to solve with your startup
[00:57:25] so basically these people are going to
[00:57:28] be the first people that you go back to
[00:57:30] once you have a solution to the problem
[00:57:32] that they've expressed that they have
[00:57:34] and that's why customer interviews
[00:57:36] usually builds a relationship it becomes
[00:57:39] customer development and these people
[00:57:40] will probably be the first people to
[00:57:42] test it out and to help you shape the
[00:57:43] product as well and then they will most
[00:57:46] likely also be your first sales and this
[00:57:49] is really the goal of customer Discovery
[00:57:52] it's lining up people as well who are
[00:57:54] going to be your first paying customers
[00:57:55] and if you're remember back to when we
[00:57:57] talked about the smoke test well you've
[00:57:59] built out a list of potential future
[00:58:02] customers and now is the great time to
[00:58:04] be able to put that list to actual good
[00:58:06] use so at this point you can basically
[00:58:08] send an email to all of your early
[00:58:12] adopters and you can have a early bird
[00:58:15] special for these people so you could
[00:58:17] run a campaign saying hey for the next 2
[00:58:19] weeks this is going to be 50% off after
[00:58:22] that the prices will be regular but
[00:58:24] thanks so much for being the first
[00:58:25] people to Believe in Us and you get this
[00:58:27] discount and then also make sure to
[00:58:28] close the deal after that time and
[00:58:30] remember that this is only the very
[00:58:32] first step because once you deliver the
[00:58:33] product then you're going to generate
[00:58:35] some revenue and you're going to start
[00:58:37] iterating on top of that so at this
[00:58:39] point you want to shift your attention
[00:58:41] from actually improving your product and
[00:58:43] services for the customers who are
[00:58:45] paying instead of just people who say oh
[00:58:47] this is interesting now of course you're
[00:58:49] not just going to depend on the people
[00:58:50] that you have lined up already we're
[00:58:52] going to continually do Outreach at this
[00:58:54] point and this is where I use the same
[00:58:55] strategy as we used in the Outreach for
[00:58:58] the customer Discovery I would do direct
[00:59:00] messages and adding people on LinkedIn
[00:59:02] who fit the customer profile I would
[00:59:04] send them highly personalized messages
[00:59:06] there are actually tools that can do
[00:59:07] that with AI you'll be able to find them
[00:59:09] below I would go back to those groups I
[00:59:10] would find in-person meetups or
[00:59:12] conferences where these people hang out
[00:59:14] to be able to go out there and start
[00:59:16] promoting my product you could also
[00:59:17] choose to release on product hunt or I
[00:59:19] think it's called beta list and
[00:59:21] basically promote your product to
[00:59:23] existing customers on those platforms
[00:59:25] who are looking for cool new products
[00:59:26] and I want to double down that inperson
[00:59:28] is actually the cheat code these days if
[00:59:30] you're just willing to go where these
[00:59:32] people hang out and meet them in person
[00:59:34] and have conversations with them then
[00:59:36] you actually get direct access to that
[00:59:37] customer base now when you go out there
[00:59:39] and start selling to these first couple
[00:59:41] customers there are two main things that
[00:59:42] you want to do to improve this process
[00:59:44] number one is to classify the kind of
[00:59:46] customer that this is right so you have
[00:59:49] all these buckets hopefully you've
[00:59:51] selected your ICP but sometimes the
[00:59:52] people you're selling to are outside of
[00:59:54] this ICP we need to make sure that we
[00:59:56] are targeting the right person with the
[00:59:57] right message meaning that you should
[00:59:59] have a conversation with each one of
[01:00:00] these individuals and you should
[01:00:02] understand if they are actually the
[01:00:03] Target customer who you believe to be
[01:00:05] the one you should be going after the
[01:00:07] second piece of advice is to go after a
[01:00:08] couple channels at first try a couple
[01:00:11] different things the first thing that
[01:00:12] you try will probably not work you can
[01:00:14] pretty much count on it so have a couple
[01:00:16] different strategies on how you expect
[01:00:18] to get your first paying customers then
[01:00:20] once you start selling you want to
[01:00:21] basically AB test you want to fine-tune
[01:00:24] the message that you're putting out
[01:00:25] there
[01:00:26] potentially the main message is what is
[01:00:28] that outcome or promise that you're
[01:00:30] delivering um also what are the key
[01:00:33] three benefits that you're promoting you
[01:00:35] might find through selling to the first
[01:00:37] three to five people that people are
[01:00:38] super excited about one right in that
[01:00:41] case you might want to start with that
[01:00:42] one when it comes to the Outreach and
[01:00:43] response rate you want to AB test your
[01:00:45] subject lines and the messages that you
[01:00:47] send out make them highly personalized
[01:00:50] don't make yourself seem like one of
[01:00:51] those LinkedIn people who's just like
[01:00:53] hey how's it going buy from me no one
[01:00:55] wants that and also remember that you
[01:00:56] are after feedback almost more than you
[01:00:59] are after Revenue at this point because
[01:01:01] that feedback is going to allow you to
[01:01:02] fine-tune this to generate a lot more
[01:01:05] Revenue down the line and create
[01:01:06] scalable marketing strategies so that's
[01:01:08] what we're going to be talking about in
[01:01:09] the next section in this section we're
[01:01:11] going to be talking about how to create
[01:01:12] a scalable marketing strategy now I can
[01:01:14] tell you from experience that most
[01:01:15] entrepreneurs think they are at a growth
[01:01:17] or a scalable growth phase when in fact
[01:01:20] they haven't figured out the
[01:01:22] fundamentals behind it and often times
[01:01:24] that leads to people spending $5 ,000
[01:01:27] towards marketing agencies who guess
[01:01:29] what they won't be able to actually help
[01:01:30] you unless you figured out those
[01:01:32] fundamentals and unless you have product
[01:01:34] Market fit you're going to have so much
[01:01:35] Market friction in marketing your
[01:01:37] product that frankly it's going to cost
[01:01:39] you two to three times the price to
[01:01:40] acquire Just One customer and there are
[01:01:43] five main questions that you have to be
[01:01:44] able to answer before you are ready for
[01:01:46] scalable growth strategies because you
[01:01:48] see this phase is really about going
[01:01:50] from product Market fit to product
[01:01:52] Channel fit which means that we are now
[01:01:54] figuring out what channels of
[01:01:56] distribution are going to be the best to
[01:01:57] invest our time in selling our product
[01:02:00] so the first thing you need to figure it
[01:02:01] out is who is the customer and what is
[01:02:03] their problem if you haven't figured
[01:02:04] this out I wouldn't try the scale in
[01:02:06] other words who is your ideal customer
[01:02:08] profile that we've discussed earlier
[01:02:10] inside this video the second is that you
[01:02:13] have a product that delivers the outcome
[01:02:15] that you promise inside your pitch or at
[01:02:18] least partially if you don't have this
[01:02:19] you shouldn't scale number three you
[01:02:21] have gone through the manual selling
[01:02:23] process and you know exactly how to
[01:02:25] structure your offer meaning you know
[01:02:28] the desired outcome you understand the
[01:02:30] benefits and you have tested those and
[01:02:32] you also know how to handle objections
[01:02:33] so the third one is your offer you have
[01:02:36] to have that solid before you jump into
[01:02:39] scalable marketing strategies and I put
[01:02:41] it in bold because it's super super
[01:02:42] important if you don't know what to talk
[01:02:44] about in the pitch then you won't know
[01:02:45] what to have on marketing copy you won't
[01:02:47] know what to have on a landing page that
[01:02:49] you send people towards and even if you
[01:02:51] get in front of the right people
[01:02:52] remember that if you don't have the
[01:02:54] offer down you won't convert those into
[01:02:55] to paying customers cuz you a lot of
[01:02:58] times in scalable marketing strategies
[01:03:00] will not be in the room to pitch your
[01:03:02] product number four is the decision
[01:03:05] making process if you don't understand
[01:03:08] the process from someone discovering
[01:03:10] your product to buying it then you will
[01:03:13] not understand your sales cycle and if
[01:03:16] for example from the first time someone
[01:03:18] discovers you to the point at which they
[01:03:19] buy it takes 6 months well you can very
[01:03:22] easily go broke investing a lot of money
[01:03:24] in scalable marketing strategies number
[01:03:26] five over here is to have a proven
[01:03:28] business model so a business model that
[01:03:31] you have tested you're already
[01:03:32] generating revenue from because now
[01:03:35] we're going to be able to make a
[01:03:36] calculation the cost of acquiring a
[01:03:38] customer versus the amount that we can
[01:03:41] make from a customer and that's usually
[01:03:43] calculated in the following way what is
[01:03:45] the cost of acquisition so this is
[01:03:47] called CAC cost of acquisition and then
[01:03:51] is that higher than the lifetime value
[01:03:54] which is the amount that you can make
[01:03:55] make uh from One customer over a given
[01:03:59] number of years which is usually 5 years
[01:04:01] if you can't make a profit between both
[01:04:02] of these then you are running a money
[01:04:04] hole my friend and you are not ready to
[01:04:05] scale okay so now let's say that you do
[01:04:07] have the answer to all of the questions
[01:04:09] I've just put on the board well then
[01:04:10] we're ready for scalable growth now what
[01:04:13] does that mean and how do you reach that
[01:04:14] the idea here is to create a predictable
[01:04:16] process to convert someone from a lead
[01:04:19] to a paying customer and early on in the
[01:04:21] process you probably want to focus on a
[01:04:23] couple of different revenue streams why
[01:04:26] because some revenue streams have
[01:04:28] quicker return on investment and others
[01:04:30] take longer to implement so they take
[01:04:32] longer to actually work and in the early
[01:04:34] days of your startup you actually don't
[01:04:36] have that much time you have to generate
[01:04:38] Revenue pretty quickly so for example
[01:04:40] direct sales well it gets you direct
[01:04:42] sales so it's very quick return on
[01:04:44] investment whereas something like SEO
[01:04:46] marketing for example might be something
[01:04:49] that takes 3 to 6 months to actually
[01:04:51] start bringing in leads so understanding
[01:04:53] that sometimes you just need very quick
[01:04:56] return on investment marketing
[01:04:57] strategies and then once we have these
[01:04:58] revenue streams we can start investing
[01:05:01] in longer term return on investment
[01:05:03] strategies like content marketing SEO
[01:05:07] strategy and things of that nature now
[01:05:09] an investor called Andrew Chen talks
[01:05:11] about this concept that early on you
[01:05:13] want to focus on smaller very specific
[01:05:16] audiences meaning that your offer is
[01:05:17] super super relevant but that there
[01:05:19] aren't that many people to Target in
[01:05:21] that specific smaller area why well
[01:05:24] because larger businesses are actually
[01:05:26] not usually focused on these smaller
[01:05:28] opportunities and this is often
[01:05:29] something that early stage entrepreneurs
[01:05:31] could take advantage of so you could
[01:05:32] invest your time into newsletters that
[01:05:34] are really specifically catered to your
[01:05:36] needs so he recommends going after these
[01:05:37] smaller opportunities so for example
[01:05:39] event marketing is one of them another
[01:05:41] one you could use is Niche influencer
[01:05:44] marketing you could also invest and
[01:05:46] start sponsoring certain newsletters
[01:05:48] that are very specific to the niche that
[01:05:50] you're in and so you're going after a
[01:05:51] smaller number of Highly targeted people
[01:05:53] and when we talk about scalability it is
[01:05:55] basically in the ability to predict hey
[01:05:57] if I invest x amount sponsoring this
[01:05:59] newsletter and this newsletter has this
[01:06:02] click-through rate and these specific
[01:06:05] people usually convert at x amount and I
[01:06:07] can make x amount of money from them now
[01:06:10] we know how much each customer is worth
[01:06:12] to you meaning that we know how much we
[01:06:14] can invest on the front end in marketing
[01:06:16] and once we find marketing strategies
[01:06:18] that allow us to pull a profit from the
[01:06:20] difference between the cost of
[01:06:22] acquisition and the amount we can make
[01:06:24] from that customer now we can start
[01:06:26] investing $1 because we know that two is
[01:06:28] coming out of the other end so my advice
[01:06:30] to you today is that stick to quick
[01:06:33] return on investment opportunities early
[01:06:35] on and then over time you can start
[01:06:36] investing in those long-term
[01:06:38] opportunities the other thing is that
[01:06:39] you want to test a couple out early on
[01:06:41] so some that I would recommend would be
[01:06:43] direct sales I would test out uh event
[01:06:46] marketing I would test out paid ads and
[01:06:48] creating a basic funnel for paid ads see
[01:06:50] if we can turn a profit on that funnel
[01:06:52] and then n sponsorship so it could be
[01:06:54] you know newsletter sponsorship it could
[01:06:57] be uh influencer sponsorship and once
[01:06:59] you find one of these channels that work
[01:07:01] you really want to double down on it if
[01:07:03] you can turn a profit from this we can
[01:07:05] now scale that up so if it's events then
[01:07:08] you can start showing up in more more
[01:07:10] events if it's paid ads you can start
[01:07:11] putting more money dedicated towards
[01:07:14] investing in paid ads and then make sure
[01:07:16] to create a system around this
[01:07:17] distribution Channel and I would always
[01:07:19] advise for you to slowly test other
[01:07:21] channels as well cuz sometimes you will
[01:07:23] find a channel out of the blue that it
[01:07:26] performs a lot better than the one that
[01:07:28] you started with and once we find that
[01:07:30] we want to invest as much of our time
[01:07:32] and energy in that distribution Channel
[01:07:34] because your goal yes it's to find the
[01:07:36] cheapest customers that you can close
[01:07:38] the quickest and because this is
[01:07:39] directly connected we're going to be
[01:07:40] talking about how to use no code
[01:07:42] automation to be able to scale your
[01:07:45] operations okay so now we're going to
[01:07:46] talk about how to use no code
[01:07:48] automations to scale your business okay
[01:07:51] so once you figured out the fundamentals
[01:07:53] of your business it's now time to create
[01:07:55] processes to scale those and use
[01:07:58] automations to automate things why well
[01:08:01] because there are so many repetitive
[01:08:02] tasks that you might be doing over and
[01:08:04] over and over and for you to be able to
[01:08:07] avoid those tasks you can create
[01:08:09] automations now what's an automation
[01:08:11] well it follows the basic theory of if
[01:08:14] this then that let me explain okay so
[01:08:16] the basic theory of if this then that is
[01:08:18] basically provoked by these two things
[01:08:22] if this takes place then that will take
[01:08:25] place right so to really start this
[01:08:28] whole process off we have triggers and
[01:08:30] these triggers what they do is well they
[01:08:32] trigger a specific action so for example
[01:08:35] if someone fills out this form I want it
[01:08:37] to send action this information to my
[01:08:40] email marketing tool if someone Books A
[01:08:42] Time on my calendar I want it to send an
[01:08:45] email automatically to that person with
[01:08:48] information I want them to review before
[01:08:50] that if a new lead comes in I want it to
[01:08:51] update my CRM if a payment for your new
[01:08:53] product comes in I want it to tr trigger
[01:08:55] people into the onboarding flow and
[01:08:57] there are thousands of examples of this
[01:08:59] that already work within existing apps
[01:09:01] that you currently use now to create
[01:09:03] these actual automations there are
[01:09:05] really two key platforms that I
[01:09:06] recommend here the first one is called
[01:09:09] make so that is make.com and the other
[01:09:12] one is called zapier These are both
[01:09:15] similar Platforms in terms of what they
[01:09:17] actually do and I actually use both in
[01:09:20] my business to automate different things
[01:09:22] and both of these allow you to create
[01:09:23] the triggers and then have action take
[01:09:25] place when those triggers are triggered
[01:09:27] and yes they have Integrations to more
[01:09:29] than
[01:09:30] 6,000 different apps so basically any
[01:09:34] app that you currently use it could be
[01:09:36] Gmail it could be HubSpot it could be
[01:09:38] stripe as a payment processor it could
[01:09:40] be your email marketing tool all of the
[01:09:42] tools that you currently use can
[01:09:43] probably use a huge amount of automation
[01:09:46] now there are actually three things that
[01:09:47] I would Implement if I were you
[01:09:48] leveraging these automation tools the
[01:09:52] first one would be a sales pipeline
[01:09:54] right so basically a sales system
[01:09:56] similar to pipe Drive which would go
[01:09:58] from a lead all the way to a closed
[01:10:01] customer and then I would create a lot
[01:10:03] of automations behind it so for example
[01:10:06] um you could have a situation where
[01:10:08] someone is jumping on calls in Zoom you
[01:10:10] could record that actual transcript of
[01:10:14] the zoom call then you could actually
[01:10:16] have tap into chat GPT with an
[01:10:18] Automation and you could have it write a
[01:10:21] personalized message following up and
[01:10:23] you could send it through Gmail
[01:10:24] automatically Al as well all through
[01:10:26] automation the second thing I would do
[01:10:28] is marketing automation right so
[01:10:30] marketing automation would basically
[01:10:31] mean when a new lead comes in it would
[01:10:33] either go to the sales team or we would
[01:10:36] nurture it in an email marketing
[01:10:38] sequence I would have all of the data
[01:10:39] live inside of air table and then I
[01:10:41] would just create different bases for
[01:10:43] each different management tool that I'm
[01:10:45] trying to replace the benefits in this
[01:10:47] is just really having something that's
[01:10:49] absolutely curated to your needs and the
[01:10:52] awesome thing is that with automations
[01:10:54] you can also tap into AI so you could
[01:10:57] have a trigger that says once something
[01:10:59] happens I want you to go and ask Chad
[01:11:01] GPT to do X Y or Z so really the
[01:11:03] possibilities here are endless But
[01:11:05] ultimately no code Ai and automation can
[01:11:08] create incredibly scalable systems that
[01:11:10] allow you to repeat the same things
[01:11:12] without putting in all the hard work and
[01:11:14] the biggest implication here is that you
[01:11:15] can have one person in your team do the
[01:11:18] same as three people so if you have one
[01:11:20] salesperson and you create a system
[01:11:22] personalized to your sales process then
[01:11:24] you can have that person deal with two
[01:11:26] to three times the number of leads but
[01:11:28] remember processes are created for
[01:11:31] people so make sure that that process is
[01:11:32] first of all tested and then adapt your
[01:11:34] system around the people who are using
[01:11:37] them this is the reason why creating a
[01:11:39] customized system to your team is so
[01:11:41] important okay so in this next section
[01:11:43] we're going to talk about how to
[01:11:44] accelerate your business leveraging AI
[01:11:47] so as you've probably seen over the past
[01:11:48] 6 to 12 months we've seen an explosion
[01:11:51] of AI tools that were kind of set off by
[01:11:54] the launch of of chat GPT now at this
[01:11:57] point one big thing I'm realizing is
[01:11:59] that so many people end up in deep deep
[01:12:01] rabbit holes playing around with
[01:12:03] thousands of tools and when it's all
[01:12:05] said and done they literally have not
[01:12:07] used it to progress in their goal that's
[01:12:09] right they're just stuck in shiny object
[01:12:11] syndrome and an analysis paralysis
[01:12:13] because there are so many tools to
[01:12:14] choose from so for this section I want
[01:12:16] to do something a little different I'm
[01:12:17] going to be talking about the different
[01:12:18] tools that I like to use and I recommend
[01:12:20] for the different stages of building a
[01:12:21] startup and also I'm going to be
[01:12:23] breaking down some of the common
[01:12:25] pitfalls that you need to avoid so that
[01:12:27] you can use some of these tools in your
[01:12:29] favor a lot of the tools that you know
[01:12:31] require prompting and understanding
[01:12:33] prompting correctly means the difference
[01:12:35] between something that is very well
[01:12:37] trained and doing things exactly the way
[01:12:39] you want them and something completely
[01:12:41] faltering so let's talk about the three
[01:12:43] important things when you are prompting
[01:12:45] so prompting tools are like chat GPT
[01:12:47] clog 2 uh and often times when you're
[01:12:50] creating custom gpts or if you're
[01:12:51] creating custom models that you want to
[01:12:53] act in a certain way we need to prompt
[01:12:55] them right so let's talk about the three
[01:12:57] most important steps for prompting cuz
[01:12:59] this is going to help you in general now
[01:13:01] the first thing we want to do when we
[01:13:03] prompt so let's say we're using chat GPT
[01:13:05] is to give it a roll now here we're
[01:13:07] going to use prompts like act like a and
[01:13:10] you might say SEO copywriter giving your
[01:13:13] AI a role is super important and I
[01:13:15] usually get very specific about this so
[01:13:17] I might say something like you are a
[01:13:19] sales manager with 20 years experience
[01:13:22] structuring teams writing scripts
[01:13:24] specific speically for B2B sales and I
[01:13:26] can even tell it it's trained on a
[01:13:27] specific type of sales system so for
[01:13:29] example I could say spin selling which
[01:13:31] is a methodology so the second thing we
[01:13:33] have to do is give it a goal so here you
[01:13:34] want to be quite specific you are going
[01:13:36] to write a first version of a sales
[01:13:38] script for a company that does XYZ and
[01:13:42] uh you're essentially going to usually
[01:13:44] be feeding it a certain amount of
[01:13:45] information as well so if you say here
[01:13:48] are some past call recordings um and
[01:13:51] you're going to be training it on those
[01:13:52] past call recordings so that it can
[01:13:53] optimize that script then that's going
[01:13:55] to be super valuable But ultimately you
[01:13:57] want to give it that goal and be
[01:13:58] specific and then the third thing you
[01:13:59] want to do is to provide it with very
[01:14:03] specific set of instructions the more
[01:14:05] specific the better so as you know with
[01:14:07] chat GPT for example you could upload
[01:14:09] all the transcripts directly you could
[01:14:12] upload images like PDFs that have
[01:14:14] training documentation that you already
[01:14:16] have in your company you could upload
[01:14:18] some information about the company
[01:14:20] itself or you could simply provide a
[01:14:21] short text about that the more data that
[01:14:23] you're going to feed it and more
[01:14:25] specific you are in all three of these
[01:14:26] the role the goal and the instructions
[01:14:29] well the better the outcome and then
[01:14:30] guess what you're anyways going to need
[01:14:32] to test the outcome and to fine-tune
[01:14:34] your instructions throughout this entire
[01:14:36] process so if you're just using a simple
[01:14:38] tool like chat GPT make sure to be
[01:14:40] better at prompting the better you get a
[01:14:42] prompting the better outputs you're
[01:14:43] going to get and ultimately you're going
[01:14:44] to be able to now use Chad gbt for much
[01:14:47] better things and so for example if I
[01:14:48] were to ask for it to write an email for
[01:14:50] me I might say you are an email
[01:14:53] copywriter with 10 years of experi
[01:14:55] experience writing emails for marketing
[01:14:58] purposes your goal is to write a uh
[01:15:01] three email sequence that I'm going to
[01:15:03] be sending to my customers to be able to
[01:15:05] nurture them you can even provide more
[01:15:07] context and say after those three emails
[01:15:09] I will be sending through an offer and
[01:15:11] then Specific Instructions I would like
[01:15:13] you to build these three emails around
[01:15:15] three main objections that we're getting
[01:15:18] from these customers and then you could
[01:15:19] ask for it to copy your tone and say
[01:15:21] that it should reference the examples of
[01:15:24] previous emails you've written to be
[01:15:25] able to copy that tone and then you're
[01:15:27] going to have a first version to work
[01:15:28] from and this is important because it's
[01:15:30] going to give you a result that's closer
[01:15:31] to what you need and then again use it
[01:15:33] as an assistant you'll be able to
[01:15:34] fine-tune that email you're going to
[01:15:36] saved a bunch of time and you can put
[01:15:38] your final touches on it and then you
[01:15:40] can launch it and that brings us to a
[01:15:41] very important point is that AI right
[01:15:43] now is an amazing assistant don't expect
[01:15:45] for it to be perfect so if you use it as
[01:15:49] an assistant you're going to be happily
[01:15:50] surprised if you try to replace
[01:15:52] employees then you're probably going to
[01:15:54] be a little disappointed so now let's
[01:15:55] talk about a couple tools that you can
[01:15:56] use in the different phases of launching
[01:15:58] your s business the first one is
[01:16:00] customer Discovery for this basically we
[01:16:03] are doing interviews with customers so
[01:16:05] we could use chat GPT for example to
[01:16:07] create a first version of the interview
[01:16:09] you could train it and prompt it and say
[01:16:11] hey you are a customer Discovery
[01:16:13] professional you need to write a first
[01:16:15] set of interview questions here is the
[01:16:18] customer that we're targeting you can
[01:16:20] also use Chad GPT or Claude AI to be
[01:16:22] able to write an Outreach message that
[01:16:24] you can then use once you start
[01:16:26] contacting people you're going to want
[01:16:27] to do direct Outreach to these people
[01:16:29] usually through platforms like LinkedIn
[01:16:31] and having that first message that you
[01:16:33] can then AB test or see how many
[01:16:35] interviews you can actually book once
[01:16:37] you've actually booked the interviews I
[01:16:39] highly recommend that instead of trying
[01:16:41] to scramble and take notes during the
[01:16:43] interview you just use a tool like Zoom
[01:16:45] has its own like U AI assistant that can
[01:16:48] basically just give you a summary and
[01:16:49] also the full script of the conversation
[01:16:51] I would also record it uh you can also
[01:16:53] use a tool like Auto . a which is kind
[01:16:56] of a more complex um Note Taker and that
[01:16:59] can provide you with those notes and the
[01:17:00] reason for that is because the last part
[01:17:02] of customer Discovery interview is
[01:17:04] analyzing the data to see like what are
[01:17:06] people saying like what is the general
[01:17:08] consensus and once we have notes of
[01:17:09] those interviews we can then feed them
[01:17:11] into an AI and ask it questions about
[01:17:14] that data to try to extract some insight
[01:17:16] which is ultimately what we're after now
[01:17:18] step two is branding and content usually
[01:17:20] what I will do is not even use AI I'll
[01:17:22] use existing elements out there I've
[01:17:25] talked about those like icon 8 unsplash
[01:17:27] but if you wanted to create some of
[01:17:29] these things like images illustrations
[01:17:31] from scratch I highly recommend for
[01:17:33] image generation that you use mid
[01:17:35] Journey it's probably the most powerful
[01:17:37] you do need to learn how to prompt it
[01:17:38] quite well for the copywriting I would
[01:17:40] focus on a tool like copy AI or I would
[01:17:42] simply use something like chat GPT or
[01:17:45] CLA 2 again make sure to use that
[01:17:47] prompting system that we've talked about
[01:17:48] earlier for the logo and branding you
[01:17:50] could use a platform called Luca l a. a
[01:17:53] you could also use logo. to create a
[01:17:56] quick logo again we're trying to create
[01:17:58] something good not perfect then we're
[01:17:59] going to want to build out a website
[01:18:01] with AI so if you have absolutely no
[01:18:03] experience you can use a tool like
[01:18:04] framer AI which is pretty powerful you
[01:18:07] can also use another tool like reloom to
[01:18:09] create the kind of wireframe in
[01:18:11] different sections and then you could
[01:18:12] push that into web flow which is a no
[01:18:14] code tool again that'll allow you to
[01:18:16] build out a very beautiful website in
[01:18:18] just a couple of minutes and frankly you
[01:18:19] don't have to always go the AI route to
[01:18:21] build your website I would also use a
[01:18:22] simple and cheap tool like card if
[01:18:24] you're just trying to get your first
[01:18:25] version off of the ground now for sales
[01:18:27] and Outreach I would use a tool that I'm
[01:18:29] going to have in the link to be able to
[01:18:31] automate some of your Outreach in
[01:18:33] LinkedIn and there are many tools like
[01:18:34] clay or Persona if you want to do this
[01:18:36] they're a little more complex and
[01:18:37] expensive but that's another option now
[01:18:40] let's talk about building out your first
[01:18:41] software platform there are no code
[01:18:43] tools that allow you to build out first
[01:18:45] versions with AI so you could use a
[01:18:46] platform like softer. a to build the
[01:18:49] very first basic web app you could use a
[01:18:50] platform like Buzzy doai to build out a
[01:18:53] mobile app or also kind of web app these
[01:18:55] are pretty cool tools you can build
[01:18:56] certain functionalities many others you
[01:18:58] can't so if you can't do that then you
[01:19:00] might want to check out first design
[01:19:02] tools so here I would recommend two one
[01:19:04] is called Galileo uh the other one is
[01:19:07] called UI zard that's going to allow you
[01:19:09] to create the different screens and to
[01:19:11] Showcase how you would organize those
[01:19:13] screens then I would jump into an actual
[01:19:16] no code Builder to build those out so
[01:19:18] you could use a platform again like
[01:19:19] softare and air table you could use
[01:19:21] flutter flow you could use adalo there
[01:19:22] are many no code tools out there that
[01:19:24] you can use that have plenty of AI sort
[01:19:26] of features inside of them and no don't
[01:19:28] expect to build out your entire app just
[01:19:30] with one prompt in AI yet right now the
[01:19:33] two first platforms I talk about are the
[01:19:35] first ones that are really going in this
[01:19:37] direction but right now you're going to
[01:19:38] need to build things inside of no code
[01:19:40] Builders or eventually with full code if
[01:19:42] you're also trying to do that now
[01:19:44] there's an entire other category of
[01:19:45] tools which are AI agents right you can
[01:19:47] create either sort of chat Bots or you
[01:19:50] could create sort of voice agents that
[01:19:52] can have all sorts of very specific
[01:19:54] roles
[01:19:55] for voice agents I usually use synth
[01:19:57] flow or you could also use platforms
[01:19:59] like air. a for more chatbot you have
[01:20:02] very specialized ones so if you were
[01:20:03] trying to get rid of customer support
[01:20:05] you could use something like Aid base
[01:20:07] you could also create custom gpts you
[01:20:09] could have things like chatbase but with
[01:20:10] all these tools the truth is that you
[01:20:12] just need to identify what your actual
[01:20:14] goal is like are you having an actual
[01:20:17] problem right like what are you trying
[01:20:18] to solve first because often times
[01:20:20] people are just checking out all these
[01:20:21] Cool Tools they're like oh this is fun
[01:20:23] but like the truth is they just get lost
[01:20:25] in tools pay a bunch of subscriptions
[01:20:27] and then they don't really get anything
[01:20:28] done for that not to be you I highly
[01:20:30] recommend that you first identify okay
[01:20:31] what is my goal then what kind of tool
[01:20:33] am I looking for to be able to solve
[01:20:35] that then check out a couple options
[01:20:37] select one there will always be newer
[01:20:39] cooler ones coming out if you could just
[01:20:41] Master one it's going to save you a
[01:20:43] bunch of time and instead of testing a
[01:20:45] thousand things and then regularly
[01:20:47] really just using nothing then it makes
[01:20:49] a lot more sense for you to literally
[01:20:50] just learn one or two or maybe three AI
[01:20:53] tools that that can help you on a daily
[01:20:56] basis because that's going to save a lot
[01:20:57] of time and money for you and the final
[01:20:59] tool I'll recommend here which is what
[01:21:01] replaces for me chat GPT is called
[01:21:03] perplexity doai the reason for that is
[01:21:05] because it's better at doing fine-tune
[01:21:07] searches for me and it also gives me the
[01:21:09] sources for all of those specific things
[01:21:11] that it's found online which is great CU
[01:21:13] I can then click through and see the
[01:21:14] actual source that it's used to be able
[01:21:16] to draft that conclusion another
[01:21:18] question I get often is how do you
[01:21:20] incorporate AI inside one of your
[01:21:22] software builds right inside your
[01:21:24] product it could be an app it could be a
[01:21:26] website there are three main ways that
[01:21:28] we can do that I'm going to show you
[01:21:29] this right now on the board now the
[01:21:30] first way to incorporate AI into one of
[01:21:32] your tools is to actually just go
[01:21:34] through the tool itself so
[01:21:36] that's in the
[01:21:39] tool what do I mean by that well for
[01:21:42] example you could use a agent Builder to
[01:21:45] be able to build an AI agent trained on
[01:21:48] the material that you feed it so you
[01:21:49] basically go in they have features for
[01:21:51] you to basically build out the AI and
[01:21:53] you build out your AI now in no code
[01:21:55] tools for example sometimes you also
[01:21:57] have the ability to Simply add an AI
[01:21:59] element so you could actually add an AI
[01:22:02] chat inside of software for example now
[01:22:05] this is really on a case-by Case basis
[01:22:07] and not all tools have ai inside of them
[01:22:10] right but if you don't have that there's
[01:22:12] a second way and the second way is
[01:22:14] through automation so basically if you
[01:22:18] want to bring Chad GPT or any other tool
[01:22:23] that has an access point to it an API or
[01:22:25] basically an endpoint uh then we can
[01:22:28] actually trigger that right so the
[01:22:30] second way that you can Implement AI
[01:22:31] inside of one of your software builds is
[01:22:34] through automation so for example if I
[01:22:36] have a spreadsheet like uh Google Sheets
[01:22:39] then we could have a trigger uh and it
[01:22:41] could either be through zapier or it
[01:22:44] could be through make that basically
[01:22:46] says hey let's go and uh talk to um
[01:22:49] let's go ahead and talk to chat GPT or
[01:22:52] maybe we want to talk to perplexity or
[01:22:55] one of these other AI providers and ask
[01:22:57] it a question and then bring that
[01:22:59] information back into our app so for
[01:23:02] example we could say hey could you check
[01:23:04] out this field and give me a summary so
[01:23:06] let's say for example you had the
[01:23:07] transcript of a sales call well you
[01:23:09] would be able to for example uh tap into
[01:23:12] chat GPT and ask it hey could you create
[01:23:15] a summary of this and tell me the action
[01:23:16] points that have to be done next and in
[01:23:18] fact you could then even send that
[01:23:20] through another automation inside your
[01:23:23] CRM so that your salesperson could have
[01:23:25] access to that now these are usually
[01:23:27] one-way connections but the Third Way is
[01:23:29] through API now an API is pretty much a
[01:23:33] two-way connection meaning that for
[01:23:35] example if you connect to an API with
[01:23:37] the weather and the weather people
[01:23:38] change the weather on that API then it
[01:23:41] would automatically update in real time
[01:23:43] inside of your app so that's basically a
[01:23:45] two-way connection um that you can do
[01:23:48] with these different AI tools to bring
[01:23:50] in AI to your specific uh product and
[01:23:53] for those of you who know me you know I
[01:23:54] like no code tools and here are the
[01:23:56] three ways that we can incorporate AI
[01:23:59] inside any build even if it's built with
[01:24:01] these beautiful Dragon drop Builders so
[01:24:03] in general with AI less is more make
[01:24:05] sure to focus on your goals and then
[01:24:06] you're going to find the tools that are
[01:24:08] best suited for that goal and your worst
[01:24:09] nightmare here is shiny object syndrome
[01:24:12] and instead of depending on AI for
[01:24:13] everything let's also talk about how to
[01:24:15] find a co-founder okay so let's talk
[01:24:17] about how to find a co-founder
[01:24:20] co-founders are by no means a must in
[01:24:23] today's world there is a a whole new
[01:24:24] generation of solo preneurs that being
[01:24:27] said having a co-founder can make a huge
[01:24:30] difference accountability being able to
[01:24:33] split tasks and Conquer those tasks
[01:24:35] together can help you navigate
[01:24:37] complicated decisions that you have to
[01:24:38] make along the startup journey and it
[01:24:40] can also just give you a bunch of great
[01:24:41] motivation but remember having the wrong
[01:24:43] co-founder can also mean a huge
[01:24:46] catastrophe for your startup journey and
[01:24:47] based on CB insights it's the number
[01:24:49] three reason why startups actually fail
[01:24:51] so my usual advice is that if you have a
[01:24:53] co-founder that's amazing if you don't
[01:24:56] have a co-founder and you want a
[01:24:57] co-founder you can take steps towards
[01:24:59] finding one but don't rush into any
[01:25:02] relationship with a co-founder these are
[01:25:04] 5 to sevene relationships and you
[01:25:06] wouldn't run into a personal
[01:25:08] relationship of that magnitude so easily
[01:25:10] so make sure you just have that same
[01:25:12] kind of vision when it comes to finding
[01:25:14] a co-founder for your startup okay now
[01:25:16] before we talk about how to find a
[01:25:17] co-founder let's talk about what we need
[01:25:19] in an actual co-founder well we need a
[01:25:22] couple of things first of all we need to
[01:25:25] make sure that that person has skills
[01:25:27] that complement ours right so for
[01:25:29] example if you are non-technical you
[01:25:30] might want someone who's a little bit
[01:25:32] more or going to take responsibility for
[01:25:33] the technical side that's usually the
[01:25:35] case if you are very technical you might
[01:25:37] need someone who's on the growth
[01:25:40] Business Development sales side of
[01:25:42] things so finding someone who
[01:25:43] complements your skill sets can be super
[01:25:45] valuable it's not a must again because I
[01:25:47] believe anyone can learn anything but
[01:25:49] think about what the startup actually
[01:25:51] needs to be able to grow and Thrive the
[01:25:53] next thing you need which is probably
[01:25:54] the most important thing is that person
[01:25:55] believes in your mission your vision
[01:25:58] they also have a long-term perspective
[01:26:00] on building a startup they're not just
[01:26:02] trying to get quick wins and be out they
[01:26:04] need to be someone who's committed to
[01:26:06] this actual mission and vision and are
[01:26:08] willing to invest time over the next
[01:26:09] couple years in building out the startup
[01:26:11] and the third thing I find very
[01:26:12] important is really just a good fit on a
[01:26:14] personal level right if this person is
[01:26:16] constantly dragging you down or if you
[01:26:18] really never agree on anything well
[01:26:21] that's probably a red flag that you
[01:26:22] might not want to be a partner with this
[01:26:23] person those are a couple tips where can
[01:26:25] we find these people now let's talk
[01:26:27] about the first way so a big mistake I
[01:26:29] see people making is going to all the
[01:26:31] wrong places to meet Tech co-founder now
[01:26:33] the first and easiest place to go is
[01:26:34] your network right it's way better to
[01:26:36] have a friend of a friend or to have a
[01:26:39] warm introduction to the person who
[01:26:40] could be your co-founder versus meeting
[01:26:42] them out of the blue and there is
[01:26:43] absolutely no context behind that so I
[01:26:45] would really start off with your network
[01:26:47] send messages to people who you know who
[01:26:49] might know people now the second place
[01:26:51] that you can go and start building
[01:26:52] relationships is in startup up events so
[01:26:54] here a big mistake people make is that
[01:26:56] they might go to like a classic sort of
[01:26:59] networking event to meet a technical
[01:27:01] co-founder there actually aren't that
[01:27:03] many technical co-founders to go into
[01:27:05] these so if you're looking for a
[01:27:06] technical co-founder instead of going to
[01:27:08] like a networking event for example I
[01:27:10] might go to something more like a
[01:27:11] hackathon where we have lots of
[01:27:12] technical people who are going there cuz
[01:27:14] what are they interested in building
[01:27:15] stuff cool stuff with other people
[01:27:17] around if you're looking for someone
[01:27:18] who's a little bit more on the salesy
[01:27:19] side you might go more to like a pitch
[01:27:21] competition where you can find people
[01:27:23] who are talking about their startups and
[01:27:24] even choose to join their team another
[01:27:26] place you can go is online communities
[01:27:28] either free or paid this is a place
[01:27:30] where people were excited about building
[01:27:31] startups are already hanging out so go
[01:27:34] to these places because you're going to
[01:27:35] be able to find them there it could be
[01:27:37] things like Indie hacker which is a
[01:27:39] great place to find people it could be a
[01:27:40] place like y combinator startup school
[01:27:43] it could be a place like we are no code
[01:27:45] we have our own Community too you can
[01:27:46] join it for free there's even a platform
[01:27:48] called co-founder Labs so you can check
[01:27:49] that out as well and then the last place
[01:27:51] is incubators so these are startup
[01:27:53] accelerator
[01:27:54] incubators um a place where
[01:27:57] entrepreneurs or aspiring entrepreneurs
[01:27:59] go to meet other people and to work on
[01:28:01] their startup ideas so really the goal
[01:28:02] here is to like just start up
[01:28:04] conversations continue conversations
[01:28:06] with people you already know who are in
[01:28:07] your network and really take things
[01:28:09] slowly because honestly actions are
[01:28:11] going to speak louder than words here uh
[01:28:14] you really want to start just dating
[01:28:16] right you want to start by working a
[01:28:18] little bit talking through the problem
[01:28:20] the vision the mission what we're
[01:28:21] working on here not just come to the
[01:28:23] table and be Des desperate to have
[01:28:24] someone build it out or desperate to get
[01:28:26] someone to sell what you've already
[01:28:27] built and again the worst thing that you
[01:28:29] can do is jump in a long-term
[01:28:30] relationship right off the bat I startup
[01:28:32] Journey from founding to selling the
[01:28:34] company if you're taking that route
[01:28:36] usually is between 7 and 10 years so
[01:28:39] building a relationship where there's
[01:28:40] actual trust is so important another
[01:28:42] very important thing with finding a
[01:28:44] co-founder is to literally be very very
[01:28:46] clear and to communicate well with that
[01:28:49] person you need to agree on things like
[01:28:51] whose responsibilities are what what is
[01:28:54] that specific time commitment that we
[01:28:56] can provide to this startup right now in
[01:28:58] the short term and then over the long
[01:29:00] term make sure this person's committed
[01:29:02] long term right obviously if this thing
[01:29:05] is not working out they won't be able to
[01:29:06] commit completely longterm but early on
[01:29:08] just kind of agreeing on the basics like
[01:29:11] okay what responsibilities what are you
[01:29:13] going to be doing what am I going to be
[01:29:14] doing how much time are we going to
[01:29:16] dedicate towards this these are all
[01:29:17] questions that are so important and
[01:29:18] communication has to be very clear from
[01:29:20] the beginning now the other thing that
[01:29:22] has to be clear as well when you get
[01:29:23] into one of these relationships is how
[01:29:25] the partnership actually works and we'll
[01:29:27] talk a little bit about that in the
[01:29:28] section where we talk about equity and
[01:29:30] how Equity actually works but you want
[01:29:32] to be very clear about the mechanisms of
[01:29:34] how people own their shares and how do
[01:29:36] you give out shares well what we're
[01:29:38] trying to do here is really to be clear
[01:29:40] from the beginning so everyone
[01:29:41] understands the rules of the game and
[01:29:43] then there aren't problems later on
[01:29:44] where certain things arise and then we
[01:29:46] have to fix them and it creates all
[01:29:48] sorts of conflict between the two
[01:29:50] different Founders so if you ask me the
[01:29:51] quickest way I would go to inperson
[01:29:53] events I would also meet more people
[01:29:55] online I would start actually
[01:29:57] conversations and meeting up with that
[01:29:58] person to work on things and then if the
[01:30:00] partnership was great then awesome we
[01:30:01] can start committing to a longest term
[01:30:03] relationship in this section we're going
[01:30:05] to talk about how to build a pitch deck
[01:30:07] now this is basically the modern version
[01:30:10] of a business plan no one's interested
[01:30:12] in reading your 30 to 40 page business
[01:30:15] plan at this point when you just have an
[01:30:16] idea maybe a product maybe even just a
[01:30:18] first paying customer the ability to
[01:30:21] communicate the message of the
[01:30:23] opportunity behind your startup is super
[01:30:25] important early stage and the pitch deck
[01:30:27] is the tool you're going to use to
[01:30:29] communicate that for you a very
[01:30:31] disheartening fact is that the average
[01:30:32] investor will spend less than one minute
[01:30:35] on a pitch deck why because they have a
[01:30:37] stack of startups who are looking to
[01:30:40] raise money from them so your ability to
[01:30:42] communicate your message very
[01:30:43] authentically and very clearly is super
[01:30:46] super important and that's the goal of
[01:30:48] the pitch deck now the first thing to
[01:30:49] know is there are two types of pitch
[01:30:51] deck one of them is a presentation deck
[01:30:54] right basically when you walk into the
[01:30:56] room and you're going to talk to an
[01:30:57] investor it's the deck that you're going
[01:30:58] to be able to use to support your
[01:31:00] arguments and flow of information as
[01:31:03] you're actually per pitching in person
[01:31:05] the other deck is actually called the
[01:31:07] sendable deck now this is a deck that
[01:31:09] has a lot of the same elements but
[01:31:11] unfortunately you're not going to be in
[01:31:12] the room when this is being passed
[01:31:14] around so you need to communicate the
[01:31:16] full message throughout that pitch deck
[01:31:18] and yeah you're going to have to have
[01:31:19] both of these pitch decks because
[01:31:21] sometimes you're not going to get a
[01:31:22] meeting until you send through a deck
[01:31:24] and that deck needs to tell the story as
[01:31:26] well as you do in person now all decks
[01:31:27] usually follow a similar structure that
[01:31:29] was created by people like guy kawazaki
[01:31:31] he had the 10 slides to have an awesome
[01:31:34] pitch deck and basically these slides
[01:31:36] are as follows first you want to kind of
[01:31:38] communicate the problem then you want to
[01:31:40] communicate the solution sometimes
[01:31:43] that's presenting the product sometimes
[01:31:44] we have an additional slide that
[01:31:45] presents the product itself then we want
[01:31:47] people to understand the business model
[01:31:49] how this thing can generate Revenue then
[01:31:51] we're going to show how that plays over
[01:31:53] time so basically the market size of
[01:31:56] that opportunity now Market size is
[01:31:57] great but once we know that we need to
[01:31:59] figure out okay great well what's the go
[01:32:01] to market strategy the marketing
[01:32:02] strategy early stage to acquire those
[01:32:05] customers then who is the team who's
[01:32:07] going to actually be executing on this
[01:32:09] strategy who are the competitors in this
[01:32:11] field and where do you position within
[01:32:13] those competitors show me a slide about
[01:32:15] financials and then probably the ask
[01:32:18] right which is you asking for money and
[01:32:20] you want that to be structured in a very
[01:32:22] specific way now that's the basic
[01:32:24] structure but there are so many places
[01:32:26] where people look like amateurs because
[01:32:28] they make some of the biggest mistakes
[01:32:29] in the book so one of the big first
[01:32:31] things I would say is if you avoid the
[01:32:33] following mistakes I'm about to show you
[01:32:35] you will already be way ahead of the
[01:32:37] curve when it comes to presenting your
[01:32:39] startup idea when I was the director of
[01:32:40] an accelerator program I would go on
[01:32:42] stage and I would talk on a panel and
[01:32:44] then afterwards I would have a whole
[01:32:46] lineup of Founders probably about 30
[01:32:48] people who would want to talk to me
[01:32:50] afterwards and talk to me about their
[01:32:51] ideas specifically and see whether or
[01:32:53] not they could get get into the
[01:32:54] accelerator or you know whatever I could
[01:32:55] provide any additional help now I would
[01:32:57] usually walk away from these having
[01:32:59] heard about 20 to 30 different pitches
[01:33:01] and I would usually have absolutely no
[01:33:03] idea what any one of these Founders did
[01:33:06] and that's probably the biggest lesson I
[01:33:08] want to teach to you today your goal
[01:33:09] when you're talking to someone is really
[01:33:11] just one thing at first is to get the
[01:33:13] person to understand what you actually
[01:33:15] do and usually the way the people pitch
[01:33:18] their startups is full of lingo they
[01:33:20] blabber for a bunch and they actually
[01:33:23] didn't get the person to understand what
[01:33:25] they do in a basic way because they
[01:33:27] expect that person to know everything
[01:33:29] and usually when you're an investor you
[01:33:31] might have a lot of knoow but you also
[01:33:32] don't know every single industry so the
[01:33:34] important thing here is to very much
[01:33:36] simplify the message so you could say my
[01:33:39] business does this and then have a
[01:33:41] second example basically where it's like
[01:33:43] in other words we do this for that right
[01:33:46] so the people going to be like oh okay I
[01:33:48] got it that's literally the only thing
[01:33:49] you have to do and everyone gets it
[01:33:51] wrong people often talk about pitching
[01:33:52] your product like you would do it to
[01:33:54] your six-year-old nephew or to your
[01:33:56] grandmother that is actually not bad
[01:33:58] advice because guess what people
[01:34:00] understand that industry will ask you
[01:34:01] very targeted questions but people who
[01:34:03] don't understand that will also be able
[01:34:05] to talk and be like oh I know someone
[01:34:06] who's like in this industry potentially
[01:34:08] you could talk to them the more people
[01:34:10] you get to understand what you do the
[01:34:12] more likely you are to be able to get
[01:34:14] all the people and resources to build
[01:34:16] this thing into something big and now
[01:34:18] let's talk about the biggest mistakes
[01:34:19] people make in their pitch Decks that I
[01:34:21] see all the time and make them look like
[01:34:22] total amateurs let's let's go okay so I
[01:34:24] pretty much have one per slide here but
[01:34:25] I'm not going to cover them all we're
[01:34:26] going to first talk about the market
[01:34:29] size right um because people think that
[01:34:32] investors want you to say that you have
[01:34:35] this enormous Market that's growing and
[01:34:37] you're going to get 1% of this market
[01:34:40] right and you're going to become a
[01:34:41] billionaire because this is a hundred
[01:34:43] billion doll industry and you're going
[01:34:45] to just take 1% of that industry and
[01:34:47] you're going to be rich guess what
[01:34:49] people will not believe that and it
[01:34:51] sounds inexperienced so if you are
[01:34:53] already saying that you're going to just
[01:34:54] get a tiny fraction of this enormous
[01:34:56] Market you're taking the wrong approach
[01:34:58] to the market Slide the market size
[01:35:00] slide really has to be around showing on
[01:35:04] a small scale that your business model
[01:35:06] works and then showing how that works at
[01:35:09] a larger scale so it's much more
[01:35:10] interesting for you to tell an investor
[01:35:12] I have five first customers they each
[01:35:14] pay let's say a $10 month subscription
[01:35:17] so we're currently at a $50 a month uh
[01:35:21] Mr tiny numbers but then you could say
[01:35:24] there are actually about 100,000 of
[01:35:26] these individuals that I could Target
[01:35:27] just in my little geographic area I'm
[01:35:30] planning on just getting a small
[01:35:31] percentage of this so maybe we're get
[01:35:33] 10% of this so let's say 1,000 customers
[01:35:36] at $10 a month so over the next 3 months
[01:35:39] we're going to hit $10,000 per month
[01:35:41] this is recurring Revenue mrr but in the
[01:35:44] us alone there's a potential for this to
[01:35:46] reach and then you know much larger
[01:35:48] number if we get there uh you know in
[01:35:50] the next 3 years we expect to be at uh
[01:35:53] 10 million
[01:35:54] mrr for example right so this really
[01:35:57] shows that hey I'm already doing this on
[01:35:59] a small scale and uh in my short
[01:36:01] vicinity there's actually a bunch of
[01:36:03] more people that I could Target and I'm
[01:36:04] going to be targeting over the next 3
[01:36:06] months but then after this I need your
[01:36:08] money to be able to bring it to 10
[01:36:09] million right that's going to accelerate
[01:36:11] the process this really shows that
[01:36:12] you're doing it you're realistic about
[01:36:15] uh the uh expectations that you can hit
[01:36:18] in a short term and then explaining to
[01:36:20] them hey we need your money because of
[01:36:22] this so don't just be 1% of the market
[01:36:25] guy no we want to be a hey we're already
[01:36:27] doing this these are the number of
[01:36:30] clients this is how much money we can
[01:36:31] make from these clients and this is how
[01:36:33] we expect to do that over X number of
[01:36:34] years just a much better approach so
[01:36:36] this is a big mistake another mistake
[01:36:38] people make often is in the ask slide so
[01:36:41] the ask slide is a slide where you say I
[01:36:43] need $10 million for 10% of my company
[01:36:46] XYZ um in this slide often times people
[01:36:50] just say I need a bunch of money and uh
[01:36:53] we're looking for investors right now
[01:36:55] that is not a good approach for a number
[01:36:57] of reasons but the more important thing
[01:36:59] is that here what we need to do is we
[01:37:01] need to tie this ask to a very specific
[01:37:03] Milestone so if you're saying okay I'm
[01:37:06] looking for $10 million and that's going
[01:37:09] to get us over the next 18 months so
[01:37:11] usually you're talking about 18 months
[01:37:13] uh of operations to X so this is
[01:37:18] Milestone actual Milestone we'll grow
[01:37:20] the revenue to this we'll uh this that
[01:37:22] we're going to you know launch the
[01:37:23] second product so actually giving them
[01:37:25] the Milestones of what you're going to
[01:37:26] execute with that money and then you
[01:37:28] want to talk about use of funds so it's
[01:37:31] like those $10 million we're going to
[01:37:33] use this amount for this we're going to
[01:37:34] use that amount for that and we're going
[01:37:35] to use this amount for that this is
[01:37:38] really going to give them a lot more
[01:37:39] confidence that you know where you're
[01:37:41] including your money and this is
[01:37:42] actually a much better approach for
[01:37:44] investors they want specific outcomes
[01:37:46] for that money they know that if you go
[01:37:48] from here to here then they'll be able
[01:37:50] to reinvest or they able to help you
[01:37:52] raise more money with other partners
[01:37:54] that they know as well and so their goal
[01:37:56] is to get you from here to here so
[01:37:58] promise this don't keep your promise
[01:38:00] vague you want to actually have specific
[01:38:02] Milestones that you're going to hit with
[01:38:04] the money that you're doing and then you
[01:38:05] want to show them how you're using that
[01:38:06] now the team slide let's talk about that
[01:38:08] usually the team slide looks something
[01:38:10] like this this this this here are the
[01:38:14] three people um and people have awesome
[01:38:17] names like
[01:38:19] CEO
[01:38:21] coo and C fo o and the truth is that
[01:38:24] early on everyone knows that who cares
[01:38:27] about the names what's more important is
[01:38:30] do these people actually cover the
[01:38:32] important things that have to be done in
[01:38:34] the business to be able to bring this to
[01:38:36] the next level so you don't need to have
[01:38:38] everyone uh for it to become a 10 to
[01:38:41] hundred million do business but you do
[01:38:42] need to have someone who's in charge of
[01:38:44] sales and marketing for example another
[01:38:46] person who's going to be in charge of
[01:38:49] building out the product potentially and
[01:38:51] so you really want to cover everything
[01:38:53] that you you would need to be able to
[01:38:54] execute on the plan that you've just
[01:38:56] described to them throughout the pitch
[01:38:57] deck now the other thing that people
[01:38:58] often do is that under here they have
[01:39:01] 1,000 advisors here are the 10 amazing
[01:39:04] advisors and it's like no no one cares
[01:39:07] about these very Loosely tied to you
[01:39:09] advisers this doesn't bring more
[01:39:11] credibility because they know that in
[01:39:13] the end of the day it's going to be the
[01:39:14] three of you who are tied to this thing
[01:39:16] and then for each person you probably
[01:39:17] want to say the role that they're going
[01:39:19] to be fulfilling but you also want to
[01:39:20] put one or two or three impressive fact
[01:39:23] right so fancy University impressive
[01:39:26] fact great one two hackathons impressive
[01:39:29] fact uh these can be very different fact
[01:39:32] it can be like you know worked for
[01:39:33] Proctor and Gamble for 10 years and here
[01:39:35] you can even have a section which is
[01:39:36] like trusted by and then you have a
[01:39:38] couple of logos XYZ you know and it's
[01:39:41] like the logos of the big companies that
[01:39:43] you've already worked for most important
[01:39:45] thing here in this slide for the team
[01:39:47] slide because these are the people who
[01:39:49] are actually going to execute on this
[01:39:50] dream this is what they're buying into
[01:39:52] the most we need to prove to them that
[01:39:54] we have the skills internally to execute
[01:39:55] on the plan and we're also the right
[01:39:57] team to bet on now the next slide we're
[01:39:59] going to talk about is actually the
[01:40:00] traction slide traction is basically
[01:40:03] Revenue it can be a number of other
[01:40:05] things but usually we're talking about
[01:40:06] Revenue here and um here I usually
[01:40:09] recommend the for traction if we don't
[01:40:11] have Revenue we want to find other
[01:40:13] impressive facts right so if you're very
[01:40:15] early stage it might be uh about your
[01:40:17] team and how much experience those
[01:40:19] individuals have it might be letters of
[01:40:20] intent of future customers who have
[01:40:22] signed something saying hey we're
[01:40:23] willing to buy this thing once it's
[01:40:25] ready some things that people
[01:40:26] underestimate which doesn't have to do
[01:40:27] with revenue is customer satisfaction so
[01:40:30] it's like if you get a review like that
[01:40:34] is pretty solid right a review of
[01:40:35] someone saying this is the most amazing
[01:40:37] tool ever another thing that's
[01:40:38] impressive are reorders right so it's
[01:40:40] like if 30% of people who ordered a
[01:40:43] first time order again that's really
[01:40:46] good news right it means oh man we're in
[01:40:47] the reorder business we're not in the
[01:40:49] like marketing business right so these
[01:40:51] kind of things are indicators that there
[01:40:53] is stickiness around your product that
[01:40:55] people like your product and that
[01:40:57] ultimately to the investor tells them
[01:40:59] hey there's potential here and this is
[01:41:01] something that could actually what make
[01:41:03] money so make sure to if you don't have
[01:41:06] traction to bet on some of the other big
[01:41:08] things that you have going for you in
[01:41:09] your startup and if you do have traction
[01:41:11] don't just talk about the revenue talk
[01:41:13] about other impressive metrics like
[01:41:15] reorder rate do you have any customer
[01:41:17] testimonials do you have any stories
[01:41:19] that you can share with them that are
[01:41:20] super impressive have you w any rewards
[01:41:23] do you have any I mean anything pretty
[01:41:25] much that can highlight why they would
[01:41:27] invest in you now let's talk a little
[01:41:28] bit about those two versions that we
[01:41:30] talked about the sendable deck and the
[01:41:33] deck that you're going to be pitching
[01:41:35] with in person right so there's
[01:41:37] basically the presentation uh
[01:41:38] presentation deck this one is going to
[01:41:41] be large numbers and images think of it
[01:41:43] that way as simple as you can do you're
[01:41:45] going to be able to quite easily convey
[01:41:47] your idea because you're actually in the
[01:41:48] room and with the sendable deck you're
[01:41:50] going to want to have a slightly
[01:41:52] different format right you want to have
[01:41:54] each slide that basically tells a story
[01:41:56] so the title might be the one line that
[01:41:58] you want them to retain right you're
[01:42:00] telling the major story and they're just
[01:42:02] if they just read the headlines of your
[01:42:03] slide they can understand the whole
[01:42:05] thing underneath there is supporting
[01:42:07] evidence so if I say the current fishing
[01:42:08] lure industry is in a crisis and then
[01:42:12] it's like small small problem with a
[01:42:14] fact and it's about time that we disrupt
[01:42:16] it you know for example and then it's
[01:42:18] like the solution sled and it's like uh
[01:42:21] an all-in-one platform to this that the
[01:42:23] other and then it's like it solves this
[01:42:25] this and this the three problems that we
[01:42:27] had here on the solution slide and so
[01:42:29] here you're going to actually want to
[01:42:30] bring people through a reading
[01:42:32] experience where they can actually go
[01:42:34] through that storytelling that you would
[01:42:35] be telling in person whereas a
[01:42:37] presentation slide you literally might
[01:42:39] just have like one actual number here
[01:42:41] and one image because you're going to be
[01:42:43] telling the story on top of the slide
[01:42:45] and that brings us to another format I
[01:42:46] do like the idea of creating just a
[01:42:48] short video so basically you can use a
[01:42:50] tool like Loom LOM
[01:42:53] or another video screen recording tool
[01:42:56] and basically just record yourself
[01:42:58] speaking over your slides and you can
[01:43:00] send that to people who are interested
[01:43:02] in it now remember that the pitch deck
[01:43:03] is usually just to get first
[01:43:05] conversations going you don't have to
[01:43:07] communicate everything and if you're
[01:43:08] trying to communicate everything here
[01:43:10] it's a real big mistake so think of it
[01:43:12] more like an actual teaser to your
[01:43:15] startup and this opportunity and then
[01:43:17] use that to actually gather some
[01:43:20] interest in knowing more from the
[01:43:21] investor so they reach out to you to get
[01:43:23] get a second meeting and to be able to
[01:43:24] potentially chat about the opportunity
[01:43:26] now the biggest thing to keep in mind
[01:43:27] with your pitch decks in general same
[01:43:30] thing with a business plan is that it's
[01:43:31] only going to be as good as you've
[01:43:33] actually built the business right so I
[01:43:36] would highly recommend that you first
[01:43:37] build a business get a little bit of
[01:43:39] traction around it because then it's
[01:43:41] going to be much easier to create an
[01:43:42] impressive pitch deck to go out there
[01:43:44] and get funding investors no longer
[01:43:47] invest in your ideas so you have to come
[01:43:49] with a couple months of traction or
[01:43:51] Revenue to be able to prove Pro that you
[01:43:53] have a case to get money to build and
[01:43:56] grow your startup and that's very
[01:43:57] important because actually every moment
[01:43:59] spent planning preparing the pitch decks
[01:44:01] reaching out to investors is a moment
[01:44:03] that you're not spending building out
[01:44:05] and growing your startup now when we're
[01:44:06] building a deck remember that you want
[01:44:08] to create a first version and you want
[01:44:09] to make that as easy as possible to
[01:44:11] adapt so adapt it yourself and then once
[01:44:14] you've created the proper content you
[01:44:16] can then start thinking of designs cuz
[01:44:17] you're going to have to adapt that deck
[01:44:19] a lot of times before it's perfect so
[01:44:21] make sure not to create perfect designs
[01:44:24] early that you're going to have to
[01:44:25] change later on okay in this section
[01:44:26] we're going to talk about how to get
[01:44:28] investors now I've raised money for two
[01:44:31] startups that I've run out of four and
[01:44:33] I've also helped more than 600 Founders
[01:44:35] raise over $56 million in funding so in
[01:44:37] this section I'm going to be talking
[01:44:38] about some of the fundamentals of
[01:44:40] fundraising and then I'm going to tell
[01:44:41] you the step-by-step process you can use
[01:44:43] to fundraise for your startup now a
[01:44:45] couple things you should know before we
[01:44:46] jump in first of all there are three
[01:44:48] paths that Founders can take the first
[01:44:50] one is to bootstrap not take any money
[01:44:52] and Own 100% of company completely
[01:44:54] viable and a very popular model today
[01:44:56] the second one would be to get into an
[01:44:57] investing accelerator program like Tech
[01:44:59] Stars or Y combinator here we're raising
[01:45:01] about
[01:45:02] $150,000 for about 7% of the company and
[01:45:05] you're basically helped to raise
[01:45:07] additional funding throughout the
[01:45:09] program and then finally you can go to
[01:45:11] investors directly and raise money but
[01:45:13] there are lots of different types of
[01:45:15] investors and there's also different
[01:45:17] strategies that you can use to get them
[01:45:19] now the first thing you want to ask
[01:45:20] yourself is when is the right time to
[01:45:23] actually fundrais you see over the past
[01:45:24] 15 years there's been a big shift before
[01:45:26] you could literally just show up with a
[01:45:28] great idea and a small team and they
[01:45:30] would just invest money in your startup
[01:45:33] today we're really talking about about
[01:45:35] 90% of all deals going towards Revenue
[01:45:37] generating startups there's actually a
[01:45:38] study that was done that showed between
[01:45:40] 2010 it was only 9% of deals going
[01:45:43] towards Revenue generating startups and
[01:45:45] by 2019 that number was already 67% and
[01:45:49] today again about 85% of all deals go to
[01:45:52] revenue generating startups and in fact
[01:45:54] a famous quote from Mark sester who is a
[01:45:57] big investor in Los Angeles is that they
[01:46:00] invest in lines not dots the first time
[01:46:02] they meet you is just one point in time
[01:46:04] and you're showing a specific amount of
[01:46:06] traction or revenue and they actually
[01:46:08] want to meet you a couple every month or
[01:46:10] two and see that the direction is going
[01:46:12] up and to the right in addition to that
[01:46:13] raising money is not in of itself a huge
[01:46:16] success 67% of startups that raise money
[01:46:19] from Venture Capital firms these large
[01:46:21] investors in C Val basically actually
[01:46:24] end up stagnating or dying so it's not
[01:46:27] because you raise money from an investor
[01:46:29] that you have a successful business okay
[01:46:30] now an important part is to understand
[01:46:32] the different profiles of investors
[01:46:34] because these act differently and it's
[01:46:36] important for you to understand there
[01:46:37] are four main sections the first one is
[01:46:40] going to be called a FFF so these are
[01:46:42] friends and family um the last f is
[01:46:45] actually for fools so people who don't
[01:46:47] have experience now again these people
[01:46:49] are usually going to be the first people
[01:46:50] that you get a check from and um fools
[01:46:53] are pretty much people who get excited
[01:46:54] about tech but don't really know the
[01:46:56] tech investing game all right the second
[01:46:59] category is going to be the accelerator
[01:47:01] program so this is a program that's
[01:47:03] going to ask for about 7% of your
[01:47:06] company for an investment of roughly 100
[01:47:08] to
[01:47:10] $150,000 and they're really going to
[01:47:11] help you raise that next round by
[01:47:13] teaching you how to actually pitch raise
[01:47:15] money uh and provide you with those
[01:47:18] connections so those are like y
[01:47:19] combinator Tech Stars 500 startups um
[01:47:23] and so these can be very beneficial if
[01:47:24] you're looking to fund raise especially
[01:47:26] if you have no experience or contact now
[01:47:28] the third group are Angel Investors
[01:47:30] these are individuals investing their
[01:47:31] own money anywhere between and
[01:47:35] $100,000 those are usually called super
[01:47:37] Angels um but basically they're
[01:47:39] investing their own money into startups
[01:47:41] and they'll make a number of Investments
[01:47:43] every single year and then finally we
[01:47:45] have Venture Capital investors these
[01:47:47] investors are very professionalized
[01:47:49] they're called institutional investors
[01:47:51] and what they do is that they raise
[01:47:51] money from even richer people um and
[01:47:54] then they basically invest in startups
[01:47:57] at scale right now the reason why it's
[01:48:00] important to understand these is because
[01:48:01] each one of them acts kind of
[01:48:03] differently and pretty much is willing
[01:48:05] to invest at a different phase as well
[01:48:07] and if you're trying to raise a firstr
[01:48:08] investment I would only really focus on
[01:48:11] friends and family accelerator programs
[01:48:13] and also Angels right because Venture
[01:48:16] Capital firms often say that they invest
[01:48:18] in ideas or early stage startups but
[01:48:20] they really don't so I wouldn't waste my
[01:48:22] time on that every investor is trying to
[01:48:24] do one thing they're trying to make
[01:48:26] money right so everything that you're
[01:48:28] talking to them about should be kind of
[01:48:29] angled around how this is going to make
[01:48:31] money so you know you have happy
[01:48:33] customers that's great because it points
[01:48:35] towards people wanting to buy your
[01:48:36] product meaning that there's potential
[01:48:37] to make money right building your team
[01:48:40] look we have all the right people
[01:48:42] because they believe that those people
[01:48:43] will be able to execute and make money
[01:48:46] so everything kind of leads back to
[01:48:48] money and they're looking to really make
[01:48:49] a return on investment for the
[01:48:50] investment they're putting in your
[01:48:51] company um you know that's basically a
[01:48:54] value multiplier that they're looking
[01:48:56] for now all investors are looking at a
[01:48:58] bunch of deals and they basically are
[01:48:59] trying to do one key thing to mitigate
[01:49:02] risk so they are trying to find any
[01:49:04] excuse not to invest in your startup and
[01:49:06] if they have absolutely no excuse by the
[01:49:08] end of the whole process they'll
[01:49:09] probably invest in your startup but the
[01:49:10] funny thing is that if you approach them
[01:49:12] and you're basically asking for money
[01:49:14] they're more likely to give you advice
[01:49:16] and if you come asking for advice and
[01:49:18] developing the relationship then they
[01:49:20] might be offering you money and it's
[01:49:22] kind of fun money because you're always
[01:49:24] in the best position to fund raise when
[01:49:26] you actually don't need the money it's
[01:49:29] just a great Catalyst for you to
[01:49:31] actually build and grow your business
[01:49:32] quickly so the question of when is a
[01:49:34] good time to raise money is pretty much
[01:49:36] when you have Revenue you are growing
[01:49:38] and you can use it as a catalyst not
[01:49:40] really for the very early stages now
[01:49:42] every fundraising strategy is a funnel
[01:49:44] let me show you cool so here's the
[01:49:45] funnel that I just drew not an artist
[01:49:47] but hey that's what you got for today um
[01:49:49] so here at the top what we're going to
[01:49:51] have are pretty much anyone who has
[01:49:52] heard of your startup right these are
[01:49:54] all the individuals let's say that
[01:49:56] you're pitching at pitch events let's
[01:49:57] say that you're sending a uh a pitch
[01:50:00] deck to different investors anyone who's
[01:50:01] ever heard of your startup then at the
[01:50:03] top of your funnel here you might have a
[01:50:05] first row who are actually potential
[01:50:08] investors right so these are potential
[01:50:11] investors um in your
[01:50:13] startup um so some people who you've
[01:50:15] contacted some people who you've been
[01:50:16] put in contact with um then there's uh a
[01:50:20] couple of these people who you've been
[01:50:22] able to have a meeting with let's just
[01:50:24] call it
[01:50:25] meet then there's only a couple of those
[01:50:28] people who actually gave you a second
[01:50:30] meeting and then here there's uh people
[01:50:33] who are going and asking for a term
[01:50:36] sheet this is where you talk about all
[01:50:37] the terms of investment and then U at
[01:50:39] the very bottom of this you're basically
[01:50:41] going to have one or two investors who
[01:50:44] are investing in your startup at the
[01:50:46] very end cutting the check right cuz
[01:50:48] even here we're talking about like
[01:50:50] contracts uh and here you can lose a lot
[01:50:52] of people along the way as well so
[01:50:53] basically one important thing to
[01:50:55] understand is that it is a numbers game
[01:50:57] so don't get frustrated you're going to
[01:50:59] definitely get NOS in fact Airbnb got
[01:51:02] hundreds of NOS at the very beginning of
[01:51:04] them raising money for their startup so
[01:51:06] make sure that you have a wide enough
[01:51:08] funnel and that you're playing the
[01:51:09] funnel game right because if you have a
[01:51:11] thousand people who hear what you do who
[01:51:13] have heard about your startup then you
[01:51:15] might get about um you know let's say
[01:51:18] 100 let's say 10% 100 investors who
[01:51:20] you've reached out to uh only about
[01:51:22] let's say 20 of them who you've been
[01:51:25] able to meet with only five of those
[01:51:27] asked for next meeting only three of
[01:51:30] those went on to ask for a term sheet
[01:51:32] and one fell out during the contract
[01:51:34] phase and so now you have two investors
[01:51:37] right each one invest let's say
[01:51:39] $100,000 and you have a 200k uh round
[01:51:43] right here boom so that's the way that
[01:51:47] you should be thinking about it and the
[01:51:48] reason for that is that you're going to
[01:51:49] be able to manage your own expectations
[01:51:51] these people get thousand of deals every
[01:51:53] single month and so don't worry it's not
[01:51:56] personal it's just them doing their
[01:51:58] business the way that they want to do
[01:51:59] their business now knowing that we're
[01:52:01] running a funnel one thing that's super
[01:52:03] important is that at the top here the
[01:52:05] way that we talk about our startup is
[01:52:07] very
[01:52:08] simple because the simpler it is for
[01:52:11] someone to understand our uh startup
[01:52:14] idea and what we're trying to accomplish
[01:52:16] the easier it's going to be to meet more
[01:52:18] people who are actually qualified buyers
[01:52:20] who kind of come down this funnel here
[01:52:22] now the reason we want to do that is
[01:52:23] because a lot of the people here at the
[01:52:26] top basically they are not your ideal uh
[01:52:29] investors right so we need to maximize
[01:52:32] the chances that some of these people
[01:52:34] can introduce us to investors uh by
[01:52:37] making them understand what we do right
[01:52:39] now here people just need to understand
[01:52:42] the basics about what your business does
[01:52:44] and then if they know someone they might
[01:52:45] be able to connect you this is what we
[01:52:47] call Lily Pad hopping actually which is
[01:52:50] where uh one person introduces you to
[01:52:52] another person to another person and
[01:52:53] suddenly you hit the right investor
[01:52:55] because you're usually only one or two
[01:52:56] connections away from all the investors
[01:52:59] you want actually reach so the wider the
[01:53:01] top of the funnel which is done by
[01:53:02] having very simple messaging about your
[01:53:04] startup allows you to have more that
[01:53:07] come in here and if you multiply this by
[01:53:09] 10 you have 20 investors at the bottom
[01:53:12] here right and that's the goal it's a
[01:53:14] numbers game okay so what are the actual
[01:53:15] steps that you have to go through to be
[01:53:17] able to fund raise right well there are
[01:53:19] pretty much five steps I'm going to
[01:53:20] break them down right now the first one
[01:53:22] is planning right preparation the second
[01:53:26] one is Outreach then it's going to be
[01:53:28] running all these meetings the fourth is
[01:53:30] pretty much creating demand and then the
[01:53:33] last one is to close so now let's break
[01:53:35] down each one of those okay so the first
[01:53:37] step is preparation first you want to
[01:53:39] prepare your pitch deck you want to
[01:53:41] prepare your financial forecast um but
[01:53:44] then what you want to do is you want to
[01:53:46] start preparing for the fundraising
[01:53:49] process so you're first going to
[01:53:51] research specific investors you're going
[01:53:54] to want to Target investors who have
[01:53:55] money in their funds for example or they
[01:53:57] are actually actively investing you want
[01:54:00] to research uh that they invest in
[01:54:02] startups like yours you want to
[01:54:04] basically create a hit list of investors
[01:54:07] who have the potential to invest in your
[01:54:09] startup preparation also means knowing
[01:54:11] the terminology understanding startup
[01:54:13] talk so that when you jump in this
[01:54:15] meeting you don't look like super silly
[01:54:18] the second thing is to prepare yourself
[01:54:19] by understanding some of the general
[01:54:21] terms that are used like metrics inside
[01:54:24] of startups for example if you don't
[01:54:25] know what retention means or if you
[01:54:27] don't know what uh CAC means or if you
[01:54:30] don't know what growth means then uh you
[01:54:34] might want to research that right you
[01:54:35] want to prepare yourself so that you
[01:54:36] don't look like an amateur in front of
[01:54:38] investors right especially if we're
[01:54:40] talking about institutional investors or
[01:54:42] people who have experience investing in
[01:54:44] startups but once you have the material
[01:54:45] and you are prepared and you also have a
[01:54:47] list of Target investors we're going to
[01:54:49] watch to start doing Outreach right and
[01:54:52] the best way to do Outreach which is
[01:54:54] step two is through warm introductions
[01:54:57] so of course you want to participate in
[01:54:58] Pitch events so you can get yourself out
[01:55:00] there to meet people who could
[01:55:01] potentially create these warm
[01:55:03] introductions but there are also other
[01:55:04] types of introductions that are really
[01:55:06] valuable right so another good
[01:55:08] introduction is for example an investor
[01:55:10] who's investing in your startup they've
[01:55:12] already confirmed they can introduce you
[01:55:13] to other investors which is great what
[01:55:15] if you don't have that well the second
[01:55:17] best introduction is actually from an
[01:55:19] entrepreneur who has gotten investment
[01:55:21] from that inv investor so if you develop
[01:55:24] good relationships with other Founders
[01:55:26] who have raised from these companies
[01:55:27] that you're looking to get money from
[01:55:29] then that introduction is going to be
[01:55:31] very good right because you know that
[01:55:33] they invested in that founder that means
[01:55:34] there is a bond of trust between the
[01:55:36] investor and the uh founder himself and
[01:55:39] then there are other levels like
[01:55:40] professors that you might have had if
[01:55:42] you've gone to nice universities or the
[01:55:44] lawyers who are essentially going to get
[01:55:45] paid to close the deal if it goes
[01:55:47] through but warm introductions generally
[01:55:49] are just the best way to go and uh yeah
[01:55:52] if if you don't have any connections
[01:55:53] then you have to start somewhere so
[01:55:54] start going to events start
[01:55:55] participating in Pitch events start
[01:55:57] getting yourself out there and you're
[01:55:58] going to see that they start developing
[01:56:00] themselves some investors also Pride
[01:56:02] themselves by actually you know opening
[01:56:04] up people's emails who cold DM them so
[01:56:06] make sure to have creative strategies as
[01:56:08] well like that where you can go on
[01:56:10] Twitter and just basically like send a
[01:56:12] quick message to someone here I would
[01:56:14] have a very simple message in one line
[01:56:16] so it's basically like explain what you
[01:56:18] do and the exciting uh sort of traction
[01:56:20] that you have to date that will probably
[01:56:23] attract an investor to at least answer
[01:56:25] uh but again the best is warm
[01:56:27] introductions now success you've gotten
[01:56:29] your first meeting booked number three
[01:56:32] is to actually go to the meeting right
[01:56:34] so here you want
[01:56:37] to you want to do a couple of things
[01:56:39] first of all you're probably going to
[01:56:40] have time to do somewhere between a 3
[01:56:43] and a 15minute pitch you're probably
[01:56:46] going to want to spend only 20% of that
[01:56:49] time pitching uh with the help of your
[01:56:52] your presentation deck and of course
[01:56:54] because you're in the room um but then
[01:56:56] also leave plenty of time about 80% of
[01:56:59] the time to answer all the questions
[01:57:00] right because ultimately you want to get
[01:57:03] the chance to answer the questions that
[01:57:04] they have because that's where you're
[01:57:06] going to show a lot of your deeper
[01:57:07] knowledge and build that trust with them
[01:57:09] now one thing during the meeting that
[01:57:10] people get wrong is that they expect
[01:57:12] people to pretty much write you a check
[01:57:13] then and there they won't right so the
[01:57:15] only goal of this first meeting is to
[01:57:18] get another meeting so that's all you
[01:57:20] need to go you need to get the second
[01:57:21] meeting that's all that you're looking
[01:57:23] for in that first meeting and every time
[01:57:25] you're in a meeting you want to find out
[01:57:26] what the next step is going to be right
[01:57:28] so not for the first meeting but as soon
[01:57:30] as you jump into the second meeting you
[01:57:31] want to start commanding the
[01:57:32] conversation so that you go towards a
[01:57:34] close now for that close to happen you
[01:57:36] have to have some other interest right
[01:57:39] so this is all around creating demand in
[01:57:41] the fundraising strategy you want to
[01:57:43] create Demand right and the best demand
[01:57:47] is when there are multiple people who
[01:57:48] want what you have to sell and you're
[01:57:50] kind of putting them in competition with
[01:57:52] each other so they want to very quickly
[01:57:54] be the first to invest right so this is
[01:57:57] where you really want to book as many
[01:57:59] meetings and go as hard as you can in
[01:58:02] the fundraising process as quickly as
[01:58:04] possible because fundraising honestly
[01:58:06] will take away from you building your
[01:58:07] business and you're going to want to get
[01:58:09] in there and out there so you can
[01:58:10] continue building your business right
[01:58:13] every moment that you're not spending or
[01:58:14] that you're spending fundraising you're
[01:58:16] not spending building your actual
[01:58:17] business and that's what matters most to
[01:58:19] all these investors as well right so
[01:58:22] create demand get more than one investor
[01:58:24] interested uh get those investors to
[01:58:26] introduce you to other investors and
[01:58:29] bring them on board and take as many
[01:58:31] meetings as quickly as possible because
[01:58:32] that's going to bring us to step five
[01:58:34] which is the close now the close is
[01:58:36] basically going to be going from um you
[01:58:40] know starting off with a uh basic term
[01:58:42] sheet which just outlines the general
[01:58:44] terms of the contract once you agree on
[01:58:47] that we talk about contracts and then
[01:58:49] basically uh money in bank and one piece
[01:58:51] of advice here is that until the money
[01:58:53] hits the bank remember that you don't
[01:58:55] have an investor even if you have a
[01:58:58] signed contract so make sure to follow
[01:59:00] these different steps and to create some
[01:59:03] pressure towards the close by having a
[01:59:05] lot of competition in the process and to
[01:59:08] be able to do that you need to be well
[01:59:09] prepared you need to be put in contact
[01:59:11] with plenty of great people then you
[01:59:13] have to run those meetings you have to
[01:59:15] learn about that and if you want more
[01:59:17] information cuz obviously I can't uh you
[01:59:18] know present everything here I would
[01:59:20] highly recommend a book called Venture
[01:59:22] deals where they really go into some of
[01:59:24] the minutia or the smaller print of how
[01:59:27] these this entire process is run and to
[01:59:29] teach you some of the terms that you're
[01:59:31] going to need to know walking in so
[01:59:32] quick recap make sure that you're
[01:59:34] actually ready for investors because if
[01:59:35] not you're going to spend a lot of time
[01:59:36] fundraising if you don't have Revenue
[01:59:38] number two focus on getting in and out
[01:59:41] of there as quickly as possible so you
[01:59:42] can continue building your business
[01:59:43] three come prepared because you're going
[01:59:45] to need it for build relationships early
[01:59:48] expecting the fruits of those
[01:59:49] relationships to pay off later meaning
[01:59:51] that you can you can build early
[01:59:52] relationships asking for advice with
[01:59:54] these investors and then when you're
[01:59:56] actually ready to fund raise they might
[01:59:57] be a great person to turn to to ask for
[02:00:00] money and number five create that sense
[02:00:01] of urgency because if investors aren't
[02:00:04] feeling urgency or fear of missing out
[02:00:07] fomo then they will happily sit in the
[02:00:09] back seat and just wait month after
[02:00:11] month for you to either go to success or
[02:00:14] fail and that's pretty much it for the
[02:00:15] fundraising section okay now let's talk
[02:00:17] about how Equity Works Equity are the
[02:00:20] shares inside of a company and they can
[02:00:22] be a very very powerful tool to get
[02:00:25] people all on board to your ultimate
[02:00:27] Mission which is to have a thriving
[02:00:30] company right and to stay long-term in
[02:00:32] that company to grow it and make it
[02:00:34] something amazing and early on in a
[02:00:36] startup you want to be very mindful
[02:00:38] about how you distribute those shares
[02:00:41] why well because investors who are going
[02:00:43] to come in and buy shares from you later
[02:00:45] on want to make sure that hey you
[02:00:47] actually value what you have here now
[02:00:50] when we talk about Equity we really are
[02:00:51] talking about two different things the
[02:00:53] first one is ownership right uh the
[02:00:56] second thing is decision-making so there
[02:00:58] are different types of shares there are
[02:01:00] sort of common stock which is just
[02:01:02] normal shares and then there are
[02:01:03] preferred shares often times
[02:01:05] institutional investors want preferred
[02:01:07] shares those come along with like more
[02:01:09] voting rights decision-making power this
[02:01:11] kind of stuff but anyway the main people
[02:01:13] that you're going to be giving Equity to
[02:01:15] in the company are employees it's going
[02:01:18] to be advisers it's going to be
[02:01:20] investors and it can be other people
[02:01:22] along the way as well but there I would
[02:01:23] really be careful with who I'm giving
[02:01:25] shares to now the first thing people ask
[02:01:26] me all the time is how many shares
[02:01:28] should I give to my co-founder for
[02:01:30] example and the answer is usually pretty
[02:01:32] straightforward and always follows
[02:01:34] similar principles right the earlier you
[02:01:37] start and the earlier you are involved
[02:01:39] in a startup the more shares you will
[02:01:41] get right uh for example if you join
[02:01:43] Airbnb right now they're going to give
[02:01:45] you tiny stock options right whereas if
[02:01:48] you joined at the very beginning and you
[02:01:49] were one of the uh co-founders with
[02:01:51] Brian chesy well you would probably have
[02:01:54] a large portion of the company right so
[02:01:56] if you have a co-founder for example and
[02:01:57] you started this thing together then
[02:01:59] pretty much makes sense to have a 50/50
[02:02:01] split and it also makes both people feel
[02:02:03] valued you'll see in the explanation I'm
[02:02:05] about to give you now that there are a
[02:02:07] couple mechanisms that happen when you
[02:02:09] distribute equity which will influence
[02:02:11] your Equity Stakes as well now if a
[02:02:13] co-founder joins later it can be
[02:02:15] anywhere from 5 to 50% that number that
[02:02:17] you would give to them and there are
[02:02:19] also some mechanisms that we're going to
[02:02:21] use and disc discuss in a second that
[02:02:23] allow you to protect the company from
[02:02:25] both yourself and your co-founder and
[02:02:27] you know each other for future employees
[02:02:29] this is a really good way to get them on
[02:02:30] board with the long-term Vision right
[02:02:33] you pay them a smaller amount of sort of
[02:02:35] upfront sort of salary and you give them
[02:02:37] some shares in the company because they
[02:02:39] actually believe that this will grow
[02:02:41] into becoming a really big Affair and
[02:02:43] you can actually make a lot of money by
[02:02:45] Simply Having shares in a startup and
[02:02:47] have the value explode so for employees
[02:02:49] who join a little bit later we're
[02:02:51] talking about any where from 1% to 5%
[02:02:54] depending on the role and the seniority
[02:02:57] level and also the stage at which you
[02:02:59] are in terms of the process of uh
[02:03:01] building the startup now for investors
[02:03:03] it's something a little bit different
[02:03:04] investors usually take anywhere from 10
[02:03:07] to maybe 30% of the company in each big
[02:03:10] funding event or funding round um and
[02:03:13] I'll explain how that influences the
[02:03:15] shares of the existing members um as we
[02:03:18] sort of go along okay let's hit the
[02:03:19] board so I can show you how this works
[02:03:21] okay so for me to explain to you the
[02:03:22] Dynamics of uh Equity throughout a early
[02:03:26] stage startup I want to just give you
[02:03:27] kind of an example say that for example
[02:03:29] you and your buddy you start a company
[02:03:31] uh the company you just split it 50/50
[02:03:34] so for the moment it doesn't really have
[02:03:35] a value you have 50% of this company and
[02:03:38] let's say that um the number of shares
[02:03:40] that have been issued uh this is really
[02:03:43] just um something that's a bit more
[02:03:44] technical is basically let's say there's
[02:03:47] 10 million shares right so basically if
[02:03:49] you have 50% then you own uh five
[02:03:52] million shares in the company right now
[02:03:55] when you go out and raise money what
[02:03:57] happens like is it you selling your 50%
[02:04:00] no what happens is that you basically
[02:04:02] issue more shares so let's say that here
[02:04:05] I'm going to actually issue more shares
[02:04:08] I'm going to issue an additional um
[02:04:10] let's say 5 million
[02:04:13] shares uh in the company that ultimately
[02:04:15] are going to be additional shares that
[02:04:17] both me and the other founder have
[02:04:19] agreed upon we're going to sell to an
[02:04:21] investor for a specific amount of money
[02:04:23] um and uh the amount of money is
[02:04:26] basically determined on valuation so
[02:04:28] let's say that we raised uh $10 million
[02:04:31] for that amount so this person's putting
[02:04:33] in $10 million here what happens after
[02:04:35] this funding round is that we have a
[02:04:37] larger company right we have both of
[02:04:39] those now the company is worth you know
[02:04:42] the uh $10 million that this person
[02:04:44] invested plus let's say that it was
[02:04:46] worth $10 before so now the value of the
[02:04:48] company is uh you know $10 million and
[02:04:51] $10
[02:04:52] $10 million
[02:04:54] $10 but basically What's Happening Here
[02:04:57] is that you will suddenly have a uh
[02:05:00] smaller percentage of the company but
[02:05:03] the company now instead of being worth
[02:05:04] $10 it's worth 10 million so you might
[02:05:08] only have at this point 30% right
[02:05:10] because now you know you put let's say
[02:05:13] these 10 million shares plus 5 million
[02:05:15] shares those are 15 million shares you
[02:05:17] have 5 million shares still 5 million
[02:05:19] shares 30% right 30%
[02:05:22] 33% um but basically the point is that
[02:05:26] um by raising money you're raising at a
[02:05:29] higher valuation and you're also putting
[02:05:30] a bunch of money in the company so now
[02:05:32] the value of this company is much larger
[02:05:34] so even though you get diluted which is
[02:05:37] you know you went from 50% to 30% here
[02:05:41] well you own 30% of now a $10 million
[02:05:45] business instead of owning 50% of a $10
[02:05:49] business so that's pretty much what
[02:05:51] happens in the fundraising process uh
[02:05:54] you basically are uh raising money and
[02:05:57] uh you're raising at a higher valuation
[02:06:00] and then you are diluting the percentage
[02:06:02] of shares that you have in the company
[02:06:04] but you have a smaller piece of a much
[02:06:07] larger company now there are other
[02:06:08] dynamics that can also take place uh
[02:06:10] usually you want to open up a pool of
[02:06:13] shares for investors meaning that you're
[02:06:15] going to issue more shares so let's say
[02:06:19] hey we need more shares cuz we need to
[02:06:20] hire a bunch of people now we have $10
[02:06:21] million in the company we need to get
[02:06:23] these people excited on board for the
[02:06:24] long run great let's open up 1 million
[02:06:28] shares on top of that um and now you
[02:06:30] know we could basically have a slightly
[02:06:32] bigger pie um and there's a small
[02:06:36] percentage of this that is for employees
[02:06:38] that we're going to distribute as we
[02:06:40] hire more people um and yes we get
[02:06:42] diluted a little bit more so we might
[02:06:44] have 28% or something like that at this
[02:06:46] point but the whole goal is that over
[02:06:48] time we are building a larger and larger
[02:06:50] company and and we own a slightly
[02:06:52] smaller percentage of a much bigger
[02:06:54] company now there are a couple Concepts
[02:06:56] that you need to understand with regard
[02:06:58] to these shares which I think are really
[02:07:00] important you want to protect yourself
[02:07:02] and more importantly the company from
[02:07:04] everyone else who has shares in the
[02:07:05] company specifically your co-founder so
[02:07:09] there is a clause that is called vesting
[02:07:12] now vesting what it means is that um you
[02:07:15] have 50% in the company but for example
[02:07:18] if you leave within the first four years
[02:07:19] you have to give up a number of your
[02:07:21] shares right so let's say that we divide
[02:07:23] that equally over the four years right
[02:07:25] meaning that if you leave within one
[02:07:27] year you have to give 75% of your shares
[02:07:30] back if you leave after 2 years you have
[02:07:32] to give back 50 3 years 75% uh sorry 25%
[02:07:36] back and uh etc etc this basically means
[02:07:39] that you earn the shares over time and
[02:07:42] the reason for that is that you want
[02:07:43] people to be committed for a longer
[02:07:45] period of time inside your startup so
[02:07:47] this is really investors will require it
[02:07:50] for you to have vesting schedules but
[02:07:52] it's also a great way for you to set it
[02:07:53] up so that if you for any reason want to
[02:07:56] leave the company at some point you can
[02:07:58] simply just be like you know what I need
[02:07:59] to step away for XYZ Reasons I'm willing
[02:08:02] to give up my shares it's very clear
[02:08:04] with your co-founder and they can then
[02:08:06] use those shares to go and hire someone
[02:08:08] else to replace you or uh things like
[02:08:10] that so it's really a healthy uh
[02:08:12] mechanism to keep people in uh longer
[02:08:15] term but also to have a very clear
[02:08:17] agreement with your uh co-founder of
[02:08:19] like hey if either of us up leaves you
[02:08:21] know we have to like provide a little
[02:08:23] bit of our shares back and so that's
[02:08:25] basically it there's another mechanism
[02:08:27] that's called a cliff so a cliff can be
[02:08:29] for testing new people basically uh
[02:08:31] let's say that for the first year you
[02:08:33] actually uh if you leave within the
[02:08:35] first year you actually have to give all
[02:08:36] your shares away so it's basically uh
[02:08:38] what it sounds like right it's like a
[02:08:39] period early on where yes you're earning
[02:08:42] those shares but you're only paid those
[02:08:43] shares if you stay x amount of time if
[02:08:45] not you get nothing and this vesting is
[02:08:47] basically just saying like yeah like
[02:08:49] we're going to split that into uh and
[02:08:51] it's basically proa which means day by
[02:08:54] day um and um yeah so if you were to
[02:08:58] work all the way to here and then you
[02:08:59] left right here you would lose
[02:09:01] everything because we're saying right
[02:09:03] here that we have a cliff for this uh
[02:09:05] for the first year uh it could be a
[02:09:06] 3-month cliff as well um if you were to
[02:09:09] leave after like let's say you leave
[02:09:11] like here well then you still have 25%
[02:09:14] that you could keep of the shares in the
[02:09:16] company so this is a simplified version
[02:09:17] I hope that it was clear though and
[02:09:18] these are the kind of things that you
[02:09:20] just kind of need to know um and it
[02:09:22] really makes a good relationship with
[02:09:23] your partner to to have clear rules in
[02:09:25] case anyone leaves and uh honestly I've
[02:09:28] been investing schedules where the other
[02:09:30] person left and they were we were fine
[02:09:32] right because then they're like okay I'm
[02:09:33] going to have to give up some of my
[02:09:34] shares perfect and uh everything's very
[02:09:37] clear and so you know you don't have to
[02:09:38] break up friendships because you and
[02:09:40] your co-founder who are buddies separate
[02:09:42] now one important thing to know is that
[02:09:44] you will need to include your team in
[02:09:47] understanding some of these basic
[02:09:48] mechanisms so they don't feel like
[02:09:50] they're ripped off if one day they're
[02:09:51] like what I thought I had 20% of the
[02:09:53] company and now I have 15 uh you just
[02:09:55] want to explain these mechanisms so
[02:09:57] those were some of the core principles
[02:09:58] you need to understand when it comes to
[02:10:00] how Equity Works in an early stage
[02:10:02] startup and now my friends we're going
[02:10:03] to jump into how to sell a business okay
[02:10:05] so now let's talk about how to sell a
[02:10:07] business I've built out several
[02:10:09] businesses and I've sold one and I can
[02:10:11] tell you that the process is relatively
[02:10:13] similar to the process of raising money
[02:10:15] the only difference is that you're
[02:10:16] basically selling not just a portion of
[02:10:18] the company but the entire company and
[02:10:20] one of the funny things about this
[02:10:21] process is that often times an
[02:10:23] acquisition offer comes in without you
[02:10:26] actually actively going out to look for
[02:10:29] someone to buy your company and that's
[02:10:30] really cool because you can actually at
[02:10:32] that point have a lot more leverage
[02:10:33] along the conversation negotiation and
[02:10:36] you can choose to just not sell as well
[02:10:38] so the best time to sell your business
[02:10:40] is actually when you don't necessarily
[02:10:41] need to sell your business now if you
[02:10:43] currently already have investors in your
[02:10:44] startups they are going to play actually
[02:10:46] a really big role in getting you to the
[02:10:48] acquisition why well because that's
[02:10:50] their liquidity EV which means that's
[02:10:52] the way they get their money back out
[02:10:54] that they invested in you at the very
[02:10:56] beginning and throughout the process of
[02:10:57] you building this company and yes this
[02:10:59] is going to be a game-changing
[02:11:01] opportunity for you as an entrepreneur
[02:11:03] it's going to be to sell your company
[02:11:04] but remember that you haven't sold the
[02:11:06] company until the money hits the bank
[02:11:08] it's the same thing with fundraising now
[02:11:10] one of the things you'll want to do if
[02:11:11] you're looking to sell your business
[02:11:12] will be to get your numbers up right
[02:11:14] because if not you're not going to get
[02:11:15] very good terms for selling your
[02:11:17] business so you want to make sure that
[02:11:18] you have Revenue growth you want to make
[02:11:20] sure that you have good profitability
[02:11:22] you want to make sure that you have all
[02:11:24] of the things and the numbers that show
[02:11:25] that this is a thriving company because
[02:11:27] what we're going to get better terms for
[02:11:29] that now the next thing you want to do
[02:11:30] is kind of set expectation kind of get a
[02:11:33] third party potentially to come in and
[02:11:35] provide a valuation of your company so
[02:11:38] you can kind of figure out U how you
[02:11:40] could be able to sell right like what
[02:11:41] price point could you sell at at the
[02:11:43] moment so that you kind of know what to
[02:11:46] expect you know what a good deal is you
[02:11:47] know what a bad deal is and uh usually
[02:11:50] this is going to be done through through
[02:11:51] a free cash flow method of valuation so
[02:11:53] just ask a financial specialist who's
[02:11:55] going to be able to create a valuation
[02:11:57] of your company now this process can
[02:11:58] sometimes be pretty complicated so what
[02:12:00] you want to do is build a team of
[02:12:02] advisers who are going to be able to
[02:12:03] guide you through it and of course if
[02:12:05] you have investors those will be the
[02:12:06] first people to turn towards because
[02:12:08] they'll have done this process many
[02:12:10] times before and it's going to make it
[02:12:12] increasingly streamlined they'll just
[02:12:13] know who to call in and they'll know
[02:12:15] even potentially who to sell your
[02:12:16] company to so that can really make the
[02:12:18] process a little bit smoother the other
[02:12:19] thing that's going to make this process
[02:12:20] smoother is to have all of your
[02:12:22] financials in order so that you can
[02:12:24] easily present those uh during due
[02:12:26] diligence now due diligence is pretty
[02:12:28] much where uh they do a background check
[02:12:31] on all of the different things they
[02:12:32] check all of the details uh to make sure
[02:12:35] that the deal is good to go and that's
[02:12:36] only really done once you agree on the
[02:12:38] basic terms of the deal then they go in
[02:12:40] and go and dig uh for all of the smaller
[02:12:42] details to make sure that everything's
[02:12:44] in line so that you can actually uh sell
[02:12:46] the business now if you're actually
[02:12:47] actively looking for someone to buy your
[02:12:50] business you want to do a lot of
[02:12:51] research beforehand right to out what
[02:12:54] kind of companies buy companies like
[02:12:55] yours what is kind of the uh price point
[02:12:57] that they're buying what's the reason
[02:12:59] why they're buying it right a lot of
[02:13:01] this information can actually be found
[02:13:02] on crunch base which is quite
[02:13:04] interesting because deals sometimes just
[02:13:06] fall through you want to make sure that
[02:13:07] you have a backup plan so make sure that
[02:13:09] you're actually not neglecting the
[02:13:11] revenue and the operations of your
[02:13:13] business throughout the negotiation
[02:13:14] process another thing you might find is
[02:13:16] that employees might get unmotivated to
[02:13:18] work hard if they know that a sale is
[02:13:20] going to happen happen so you might want
[02:13:22] to be very strategic about the way that
[02:13:24] you communicate it uh you might want to
[02:13:26] keep only a very small number of people
[02:13:28] uh involved in the process of selling
[02:13:30] your company until it's actually done
[02:13:32] and then everyone can reap the rewards
[02:13:34] right especially people who are key to
[02:13:36] the operations of the company cuz we
[02:13:37] don't want them to lose motivation but
[02:13:39] also uh we don't want them to not know
[02:13:42] about the deal at all so at first you
[02:13:43] might want to keep a small number of
[02:13:45] people knowing about the actual
[02:13:47] transaction that's taking place because
[02:13:48] hey it could fall through and if it does
[02:13:51] you don't want them to be excited and
[02:13:53] then it falls through um so there's kind
[02:13:55] of a balance that has to take place
[02:13:57] there in terms of the communication to
[02:13:58] your larger team now a couple tips here
[02:14:00] a make sure that you have multiple
[02:14:02] parties interested in buying your
[02:14:04] company uh and uh two would be to
[02:14:07] basically angle the sale of your company
[02:14:10] strategically to what they want right so
[02:14:12] the company who's buying your company
[02:14:13] are really looking for something in your
[02:14:16] company right your company is really
[02:14:17] going to uh give them something they
[02:14:20] don't currently have make sure that when
[02:14:21] you actually talk about your company
[02:14:23] you're positioning it as a solution to
[02:14:24] what they're trying to do so for example
[02:14:26] if you're a AI consulting company and
[02:14:28] you're selling to a larger consulting
[02:14:30] company they want that knowhow they want
[02:14:32] those clients they want the employees so
[02:14:34] make sure that you angle things in the
[02:14:36] direction of being the solution to their
[02:14:38] problem so that you have higher
[02:14:39] likelihood of having interest from them
[02:14:41] the third piece of advice is just hire
[02:14:43] an m&a lawyer if you need to mergers an
[02:14:46] acquisition basically someone who's used
[02:14:47] to selling companies um you know day in
[02:14:49] day out and then yes if you have
[02:14:51] investors rely on them too and that was
[02:14:53] how to sell your company as well now
[02:14:55] we've covered pretty much every step but
[02:14:56] I do want to share some of the key
[02:14:58] mistakes that I think that a lot of
[02:15:00] Founders make and how you can actually
[02:15:02] avoid them because I think that just
[02:15:04] avoiding those can save you a lot of
[02:15:06] time and money along the way so let's
[02:15:07] jump into them okay so in this bonus
[02:15:09] section I want to talk about some of the
[02:15:10] largest mistakes that I've seen so many
[02:15:12] people go down and how you can avoid
[02:15:14] them in your startup you see when I ran
[02:15:16] a startup accelerator program I
[02:15:18] literally saw thousands of startups and
[02:15:21] so many of the mistakes were the same so
[02:15:23] if you can simply avoid those mistakes
[02:15:24] you can learn from other people's and
[02:15:26] you don't have to commit those and you
[02:15:28] don't have to waste time and money so
[02:15:30] let's talk about the key ones that I
[02:15:31] found the first one is don't hire
[02:15:33] expensive programmers and designers to
[02:15:36] test the market and to get first demand
[02:15:38] to get an understanding and even usually
[02:15:40] to build your first product there are
[02:15:42] tools out there that allow you to do
[02:15:44] that yourself and to have more control
[02:15:46] why because the number one reason
[02:15:47] startups fail is because they don't find
[02:15:50] product markeet fit and that Journey
[02:15:52] sometimes can take a while so the more
[02:15:54] that you invest in learning the skills
[02:15:56] to actually experiment with different uh
[02:15:59] sort of Target markets and business
[02:16:01] models and products the more likely you
[02:16:05] are to be able to nail it and at some
[02:16:07] point then be able to grow the business
[02:16:09] right so having control early on is
[02:16:12] really important and as soon as the bank
[02:16:13] hits zero is pretty much when you have
[02:16:15] to close so for that not to happen make
[02:16:18] sure that you aren't spending a bunch of
[02:16:20] money left and right the second thing is
[02:16:21] procrastination so basically that can
[02:16:23] take form of shiny object syndrome where
[02:16:26] you're constantly distracted like
[02:16:27] interested in all these cool new things
[02:16:29] coming out but you're not actually
[02:16:30] taking actions um another way that that
[02:16:33] could show itself is basically through
[02:16:35] perfectionism so you're like working on
[02:16:37] something and you want it to be so
[02:16:38] perfect and it takes ages for you to
[02:16:40] launch that first product like and then
[02:16:42] you end up going to Market realizing oh
[02:16:44] we have to change it anyway and so all
[02:16:45] that Perfection was for really for
[02:16:47] nothing so time early on in a startup is
[02:16:50] one of the most important resources that
[02:16:52] you have and the quicker you're able to
[02:16:55] quickly figure out what the market
[02:16:57] actually wants and kind of pivot towards
[02:17:00] that the quicker that you're going to be
[02:17:01] able to find product Market fit generate
[02:17:03] revenue and then be able to grow from
[02:17:05] there another thing is analysis
[02:17:07] paralysis so basically just overthinking
[02:17:09] things thinking that you can think your
[02:17:11] way through problems no you got to take
[02:17:13] action action over Perfection as we
[02:17:16] talked about earlier and through those
[02:17:18] actions you're going to understand
[02:17:20] what's required and then you're going to
[02:17:21] be able to adapt that now the third
[02:17:23] piece of advice is that if you are going
[02:17:25] to fund raise trust me it takes a huge
[02:17:27] amount of time and effort constantly
[02:17:29] changing pitch deck's Financial
[02:17:31] forecasts and you definitely don't want
[02:17:34] to do that too early right because every
[02:17:36] moment is the moment you're taking out
[02:17:37] from actually building your business
[02:17:40] plus no investor cares until you
[02:17:42] actually have Revenue so make sure that
[02:17:44] you only go after raising money if ever
[02:17:48] when you have revenue and revenue over
[02:17:50] at least at least 3 to 6 months with a
[02:17:52] proven model and you're really just
[02:17:54] looking for that money to grow now the
[02:17:55] next piece of advice is to not get
[02:17:57] distracted by the competition you can
[02:18:00] build businesses million dooll
[02:18:03] businesses with lots of direct
[02:18:05] competitors so don't think that because
[02:18:07] there's a company that's doing something
[02:18:09] similar to what you do that there isn't
[02:18:11] an opportunity for you to do it yourself
[02:18:13] and have a million dooll business don't
[02:18:16] always think that you have to build a
[02:18:18] billion dooll business to be happy often
[02:18:20] times this is what we hear in the news
[02:18:22] and it is a load of BS if you ask me we
[02:18:25] want to really build businesses so that
[02:18:27] we have freedom so that we create this
[02:18:29] Financial Freedom and uh also so that we
[02:18:32] can do things that we actually care
[02:18:33] about and build things that are
[02:18:35] meaningful so don't always get caught up
[02:18:38] into the main Narrative of like hey I
[02:18:39] got to raise a bunch of money and then I
[02:18:41] got to build a billion dooll company or
[02:18:43] nothing trust me there are so many happy
[02:18:45] Founders out there that are running
[02:18:46] companies that just generate a couple
[02:18:48] hundred, for them personally
[02:18:51] every single year and through that you
[02:18:53] can do it for years and years and be
[02:18:55] very happy and my last piece of advice
[02:18:56] which is probably the most important is
[02:18:58] do not procrastinate on your business
[02:19:00] model you don't have a business until
[02:19:02] you have first paying customers so make
[02:19:06] sure to very quickly test business
[02:19:08] models out it's okay if you don't make
[02:19:11] money from the first business model and
[02:19:12] if that doesn't work out because you
[02:19:14] always have the opportunity to change
[02:19:16] but if you're procrastinating on making
[02:19:18] money you will never figure out how to
[02:19:20] turn this idea into a revenue generating
[02:19:23] business and that's ultimately why we're
