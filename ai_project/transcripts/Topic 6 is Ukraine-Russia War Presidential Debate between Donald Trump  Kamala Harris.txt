[00:00:01] Here Again David mure and Lindsey Davis
[00:00:04] welcome back to this historic ABC News
[00:00:06] presidential debate tonight we're going
[00:00:08] to continue here and I want to turn to
[00:00:09] the war in Ukraine we're now two and a
[00:00:10] half years uh into this conflict Mr
[00:00:13] President it has been the position of
[00:00:14] the Biden Administration that we must
[00:00:16] defend Ukraine from Russia from Vladimir
[00:00:18] Putin to defend their sovereignty their
[00:00:20] democracy that it's in America's best
[00:00:22] interest to do so arguing that if Putin
[00:00:24] wins he may be embolden to move even
[00:00:26] further into other countries you have
[00:00:28] said you would solve this war 24 hours
[00:00:30] you said so just before the break
[00:00:32] tonight how exactly would you do that
[00:00:34] and I want to ask you a very simple
[00:00:36] question tonight do you want Ukraine to
[00:00:38] win this War I want the war to stop I
[00:00:41] want to save lives that are being
[00:00:43] uselessly people being killed by the
[00:00:46] millions it's the millions it's so much
[00:00:49] worse than the numbers that you're
[00:00:50] getting which are fake numbers look
[00:00:53] we're in for 250 billion or more because
[00:00:57] they don't ask Europe which is a much
[00:00:59] big ger beneficiary to getting this
[00:01:01] thing done than we are they're in for
[00:01:04] $150 billion less because Biden and you
[00:01:08] don't have the courage to ask Europe
[00:01:11] like I did with NATO they paid billions
[00:01:14] and billions hundreds of billions of
[00:01:16] dollars when I said either you pay up or
[00:01:18] we're not going to protect you anymore
[00:01:20] so that's maybe one of the reasons they
[00:01:21] don't like me as much as they like weak
[00:01:23] people but you take a look at what's
[00:01:26] happening we're in for 250 to 2 75
[00:01:30] billion they're into 100 to 150 they
[00:01:34] should be forced to equalize with that
[00:01:37] being said I want to get the War settled
[00:01:39] I know zalinski very well and I know
[00:01:41] Putin very well I have a good
[00:01:43] relationship and they respect your
[00:01:45] president okay they respect me they
[00:01:47] don't respect Biden how would you
[00:01:49] respect him why for what reason he
[00:01:52] hasn't even made a phone call in two
[00:01:53] years to Putin hasn't spoken to anybody
[00:01:56] they don't even try and get it that is a
[00:01:58] war that's dying to be settled I will
[00:02:00] get it settled before I even become
[00:02:02] president if I win when I'm president
[00:02:04] elect and what I'll do is I'll speak to
[00:02:07] one I'll speak to the other I'll get
[00:02:09] them together that war would have never
[00:02:11] happened and in fact when I saw Putin
[00:02:14] after I left unfortunately left because
[00:02:17] our our country has gone to hell but
[00:02:19] after I left when I saw him building up
[00:02:21] soldiers he did it after I left I said
[00:02:24] oh he must be negotiating it must be a
[00:02:27] good strong point of negotiation well it
[00:02:29] wasn't because Biden had no idea how to
[00:02:32] talk to him he had no idea how to stop
[00:02:34] it and now you have millions of people
[00:02:36] dead and it's only getting worse and it
[00:02:38] could lead to World War I don't kid
[00:02:41] yourself David we're playing with World
[00:02:43] War III and we have a president that we
[00:02:45] don't even know if he's where is our
[00:02:47] president we don't even know if he's a
[00:02:49] president and just to clarify they threw
[00:02:50] him out of a campaign like a dog we
[00:02:52] don't even know is he our president but
[00:02:55] we have a president Mr that doesn't know
[00:02:57] he's alive your time is up and with the
[00:02:59] just to clarify in the question do you
[00:03:01] believe it's in the US best interest for
[00:03:04] Ukraine to win this war yes or no I
[00:03:05] think it's the US best interest to get
[00:03:07] this war finished and just get it done
[00:03:10] negotiate a deal because we have to stop
[00:03:12] all of these human lives from being
[00:03:15] destroyed I want to take this to vice
[00:03:16] president Harris I want to get your
[00:03:18] thoughts on support for Ukraine in this
[00:03:20] moment but also as commander-in-chief if
[00:03:23] elected how would you deal with Vladimir
[00:03:25] Putin and would it be any different from
[00:03:27] what we're seeing from President Biden
[00:03:29] well first of all it's important to
[00:03:31] remind the former president you're not
[00:03:33] running against Joe Biden you're running
[00:03:34] against
[00:03:36] me I believe the reason that Donald
[00:03:38] Trump says that this war would be over
[00:03:40] within 24 hours is because he would just
[00:03:42] give it up and that's not who we are as
[00:03:45] Americans let's understand what happened
[00:03:47] here um I actually met with zalinski a
[00:03:51] few days before Russia invaded tried
[00:03:54] through Force to change territorial
[00:03:57] boundaries to defy one of the most
[00:03:59] important International rules and Norms
[00:04:02] which is the importance of sovereignty
[00:04:04] and territorial integrity and I met with
[00:04:06] President zansky I shared with him
[00:04:08] American intelligence about how he could
[00:04:10] defend himself days later I went to
[00:04:12] NATO's Eastern flank to Poland and
[00:04:15] Romania and through the work that I and
[00:04:18] others did we brought 50 countries
[00:04:20] together to support Ukraine in its
[00:04:23] righteous defense and because of our
[00:04:26] support because of the air defense the
[00:04:29] ammunition the artillery the javelins
[00:04:32] the Abrams tanks that we have provided
[00:04:35] Ukraine stands as an independent and
[00:04:37] free country if Donald Trump were
[00:04:39] President Putin would be sitting in keev
[00:04:41] right now and understand what that would
[00:04:44] mean because Putin's agenda is not just
[00:04:47] about
[00:04:48] Ukraine understand why the European
[00:04:50] allies and our NATO allies are so
[00:04:53] thankful that you are no longer
[00:04:56] president and that we understand the
[00:04:59] import of the greatest military Alliance
[00:05:01] the world has ever known which is NATO
[00:05:04] and what we have done to preserve the
[00:05:07] ability of zalinski and the ukrainians
[00:05:09] to fight for their independence
[00:05:11] otherwise Putin would be sitting in keev
[00:05:14] with his eyes on the rest of Europe
[00:05:16] starting with Poland and why don't you
[00:05:18] tell the 800,000 polish Americans right
[00:05:20] here in Pennsylvania how quickly you
[00:05:23] would give up for the sake of favor and
[00:05:26] what you think is a friendship with what
[00:05:29] is known to be a dictator who would eat
[00:05:31] you for
[00:05:33] lunch vice president Harris thank you
[00:05:35] we've heard from both of you on Ukraine
[00:05:36] tonight Afghanistan came up in the last
[00:05:38] hour I I wanted her to respond to
[00:05:40] something you said earlier and I please
[00:05:42] I'll I'll give you a minute here Putin
[00:05:45] would be sitting in Moscow and he
[00:05:47] wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women
[00:05:51] but he would have been sitting in Moscow
[00:05:53] quiet place he would have been sitting
[00:05:55] in Moscow much happier than he is right
[00:05:58] now but but eventually you know he's got
[00:06:00] a thing that other people don't have
[00:06:02] he's got nuclear weapons they don't ever
[00:06:04] talk about that he got nuclear weapons
[00:06:06] nobody ever thinks about that and
[00:06:08] eventually maybe he'll use him and maybe
[00:06:11] he hasn't been that threatening but he
[00:06:13] does have that something we don't even
[00:06:15] like to talk about nobody likes to talk
[00:06:17] about it but just so you understand they
[00:06:20] sent her to negotiate peace before this
[00:06:23] war started three days later he went in
[00:06:26] and he started the war because
[00:06:27] everything they said was weak and stupid
[00:06:30] they said the wrong things that war
[00:06:32] should have never started she was the
[00:06:34] Emissary they sent her in to negotiate
[00:06:37] with zalinski and Putin and she did and
[00:06:41] the war started three days later and
[00:06:43] that's the kind of talent we have with
[00:06:45] her she's worse than Biden in my opinion
[00:06:48] I think he's the worst president in the
[00:06:49] history of our country she goes down as
[00:06:51] the worst vice president in the history
[00:06:54] of our country but let me tell you
[00:06:55] something she is a horrible negotiator
[00:06:58] they sent her to negotiate as soon as
[00:07:01] they left Putin did The Invasion
[00:07:03] president Trump thank you you did bring
[00:07:04] up something you said she went to
[00:07:05] negotiate with Vladimir Putin vice
[00:07:07] president Harris have you ever met
[00:07:08] Vladimir Putin can you clarify tonight
[00:07:11] yet again I said it at the beginning of
[00:07:12] this debate you're going to hear a bunch
[00:07:13] of Lies coming from this fellow and that
[00:07:15] is another one when I went to meet with
[00:07:18] President zansi I've now met with him
[00:07:20] over five
[00:07:21] times the reality is it has been about
[00:07:24] standing as America always should as a
[00:07:28] leader upholding International rules and
[00:07:31] Norms as a leader who shows strength
[00:07:35] understanding that the alliances we have
[00:07:37] around the world are dependent on our
[00:07:40] ability to look out for our friends and
[00:07:43] not favor our enemies because you adore
[00:07:47] strong men instead of caring about
[00:07:50] democracy and that is very much what is
[00:07:53] at stake here the president of the
[00:07:55] United States is commanderin-chief and
[00:07:57] the American people have a right to rely
[00:08:01] on a president who understands the
[00:08:04] significance of America's role and
[00:08:07] responsibility in terms of ensuring that
[00:08:10] there is stability and ensuring we stand
[00:08:12] up for our principles and not sell them
[00:08:15] for the for the benefit of personal
[00:08:18] flattery we've talked about Ukraine and
[00:08:20] Vladimir Putin I do want to talk about
[00:08:22] Afghanistan it came up in in the first
[00:08:24] hour of this debate I I wanted to move
[00:08:26] on to Afghanistan Stenberg said Trump
[00:08:28] did the most amazing thing I've ever
[00:08:30] seen he got these countries the 28
[00:08:33] countries at the time to pay up he said
[00:08:35] I've never seen he's the head of NATO he
[00:08:38] said I've never seen for years we were
[00:08:40] paying almost all of NATO we were being
[00:08:43] ripped off by European nations both on
[00:08:45] trade and on NATO I got them to pay up
[00:08:48] by saying one of the statements you made
[00:08:50] before if you don't pay we're not going
[00:08:52] to protect you otherwise we would have
[00:08:54] never gotten it he said it was one of
[00:08:56] the most incredible jobs that he's ever
[00:08:58] seen done thank you I want to turn
