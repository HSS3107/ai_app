[00:00:00] but this is it like literally this is
[00:00:02] all the smart stuff I know period and
[00:00:04] it's all in like maybe 14 slides so it's
[00:00:06] really fast all right let's go how to
[00:00:08] start a Technical startup first one two
[00:00:11] to four
[00:00:12] co-founders at least 50% engineering
[00:00:15] they all have to have somewhat around a
[00:00:17] Year's worth of money in the bank but
[00:00:19] that doesn't mean a Year's worth of
[00:00:20] money living in a one-bedroom apartment
[00:00:22] like in a high-rise that means a years
[00:00:24] worth of money eating ramen noodles and
[00:00:25] being very poor and everyone has to have
[00:00:29] quit their job
[00:00:30] this is what you need to start a startup
[00:00:32] notice no idea is required you just need
[00:00:35] this that's it second idea I always
[00:00:39] think that it's better to start
[00:00:41] brainstorming with your teammates
[00:00:43] typically one member of the team has the
[00:00:45] kernel of an idea that'll become the
[00:00:47] company but it's always best before that
[00:00:49] gets too solidified to discuss it with
[00:00:52] your teammates so that everyone Buys in
[00:00:53] and gets ownership we tend to like
[00:00:55] companies who are trying to solve
[00:00:57] personal problems every investor says
[00:00:58] that the real thing is we like companies
[00:01:01] where the founders know what the hell
[00:01:02] the companies are doing and know what
[00:01:04] the problem is so if it's not solving
[00:01:05] your problem it should be solving a
[00:01:07] problem that you're very very aware of
[00:01:09] and then the other thing I tell Founders
[00:01:11] is try to focus on daily and weekly
[00:01:13] problems as opposed to monthly or yearly
[00:01:17] problems it's a lot easier to do
[00:01:19] something like uber the typical person
[00:01:21] in America has to figure out how to get
[00:01:23] somewhere three times a day it's a lot
[00:01:25] harder to do a car sales website the
[00:01:27] typical person in America only buys a
[00:01:29] car once every seven years try to focus
[00:01:31] on daily and weekly problems it tends to
[00:01:34] be a lot more successful Market this is
[00:01:36] an area that like people talk so much
[00:01:38] about do an hour of research figure out
[00:01:41] whether there are billions of dollars
[00:01:43] being made in your Market um and use
[00:01:45] your competitors product after that I
[00:01:47] don't care legal if you guys are
[00:01:49] interested in raising money in the US
[00:01:50] you're going to have to incorporate in
[00:01:51] the US that is a very very very simple
[00:01:55] process for $250 and clerk.com you can
[00:01:58] have an American company and you can
[00:02:01] raise money from American investors yeah
[00:02:03] it's that's easy let's the mystify that
[00:02:05] mvp most viable product this is where
[00:02:07] most companies will screw up actually
[00:02:09] sorry where most companies will screw up
[00:02:11] is on team this is the second place most
[00:02:12] companies will screw up how can you get
[00:02:15] something into people's hands I can't
[00:02:17] tell you I've done this many times
[00:02:19] myself the number one piece of advice we
[00:02:21] give to YC companies before they launch
[00:02:24] is launch I can't tell you how many
[00:02:26] people will just sit there and iterate
[00:02:27] and iterate before users ever see
[00:02:29] anything so when I ask a company how
[00:02:31] long is going to take to launch I always
[00:02:34] just ask them why does it take longer
[00:02:36] than two months like I don't care what
[00:02:38] it is I don't care if they haven't
[00:02:39] started yet you should be able to build
[00:02:41] something in two months and get it in
[00:02:43] front of users this is just saying it
[00:02:44] one more time you're nothing into your
[00:02:46] launch so how do you achieve growth I
[00:02:48] would say that for the typical Silicon
[00:02:50] Valley investor this is the number one
[00:02:52] metric for determining whether you're
[00:02:53] going to raise money it's not team it's
[00:02:56] not past experience it's not fancy
[00:03:00] investors its growth so
[00:03:03] um typically you're going to go one of
[00:03:06] three places one you're going to
[00:03:07] experiment with ads I tend to like that
[00:03:09] strategy the least the second if you're
[00:03:11] B2B you really want to focus on
[00:03:13] reference customers the customers who
[00:03:15] you can provide amazing service to who's
[00:03:17] going to talk to other people in their
[00:03:19] industry and spread the word about you
[00:03:21] the last one if you're doing anything
[00:03:23] related to Consumer whether it's
[00:03:24] consumer services social media Etc usage
[00:03:27] should equal sharing I can't tell you
[00:03:29] how many Founders I've talked to said oh
[00:03:31] I'm going to make my thing go viral well
[00:03:34] if you want to make your thing go viral
[00:03:36] it doesn't mean just adding a share
[00:03:37] button the very fact that people are
[00:03:39] using your product has to create some
[00:03:42] type of sharing that has to be built in
[00:03:44] from day one and so don't think of
[00:03:46] sharing as an extra activity or a side
[00:03:48] activity think of it as 100% part of
[00:03:51] using your product all right press a lot
[00:03:54] of people think that they need to hire
[00:03:57] someone to do their PR at Justin TV me
[00:03:59] my co-founder had a little competition
[00:04:02] on how much money uh we've wasted and
[00:04:05] we'd write it up on a whiteboard and
[00:04:06] every time we wasted money we'd write it
[00:04:08] up there and add it up uh I've wasted
[00:04:10] over
[00:04:11] $150,000 on PR firms so I'm giving those
[00:04:14] advice because I don't want you to do
[00:04:16] the same thing 99% of PR in the early
[00:04:19] stage you can do yourself the best piece
[00:04:21] of advice I've given I've been given
[00:04:23] about PR the thing that completely
[00:04:25] changed my whole perception is that PR
[00:04:28] is exactly like business Business
[00:04:29] Development when you're trying to do a
[00:04:31] BD deal you get a warm introduction you
[00:04:33] follow up you build a relationship and
[00:04:36] you provide something of value when
[00:04:38] you're dealing with press it's the exact
[00:04:40] same thing you need to get an
[00:04:42] introduction from someone hopefully who
[00:04:44] that reporter is always written about
[00:04:46] you need to be able to structure your
[00:04:48] pitch so that it's real news something
[00:04:50] launching money being raised a
[00:04:52] significant higher a significant new BD
[00:04:54] deal you can't just expect the profile
[00:04:57] piece and what you need to do is make
[00:04:59] sure you treat that as a relationship
[00:05:02] once you have a reporter who's written
[00:05:03] about you you've got to follow up with
[00:05:05] them that becomes a very very important
[00:05:08] relationship that can continue to
[00:05:09] provide value if you continue to follow
[00:05:11] up PR very simple and don't spend money
[00:05:14] fundraising typically companies will
[00:05:16] come to
[00:05:17] YC and ask how do we start
[00:05:21] fundraising and the number one thing we
[00:05:23] say to them is that if you don't need
[00:05:25] money people love to give it to you so
[00:05:28] how do you put yourself in the position
[00:05:30] of not needing money one let's not start
[00:05:33] the company with a $1 million marketing
[00:05:36] and advertising plan right that's you
[00:05:38] need money for that um think about how
[00:05:41] you can structure your company so all
[00:05:42] you have to do is pay for the living
[00:05:45] expenses of your co-founders that's it
[00:05:47] hopefully your MVP requires so little
[00:05:49] money to get up and running that you can
[00:05:52] produce some growth without needing it
[00:05:54] the second thing is that people don't
[00:05:56] quite understand that speed when it
[00:05:59] comes to fundraising is extremely
[00:06:00] important um when you have meetings with
[00:06:03] investors you want them to be scheduled
[00:06:05] as tightly as possible like one week
[00:06:08] every single introduction meeting you
[00:06:09] have with an investor um the purpose of
[00:06:11] this is that one it creates Buzz around
[00:06:13] your fund raise two It lines all the
[00:06:16] investors up so if one investor wants to
[00:06:18] take a step forward you can contact
[00:06:21] everyone else you just met in the
[00:06:22] previous week and said hey look we've
[00:06:23] got someone on hook here do you want to
[00:06:25] come along or not the biggest mistake we
[00:06:27] see people make is doing invest ing
[00:06:30] these investment meetings serially I'll
[00:06:32] take one this week I'll take one next
[00:06:33] week I'll take one the week after that
[00:06:35] investors move because they have a fear
[00:06:36] of missing out fomo you're not creating
[00:06:39] a fear of missing out if you're only
[00:06:40] talking to them one at a time the last
[00:06:42] thing is have growth having growth is
[00:06:44] like the solution to every single
[00:06:45] problem the more you're growing the more
[00:06:47] investors are going to invest time
[00:06:48] finding you as opposed to other way
[00:06:50] around so you're having problems
[00:06:52] fundraising how many people right now
[00:06:54] are looking to fund raise in this
[00:06:55] audience okay all right beautiful four
[00:06:58] things to think about
[00:07:00] one are you growing I should have asked
[00:07:02] have you launched if you have a launch
[00:07:04] plan that requires fundraising change it
[00:07:06] two are you talking to the Press it's
[00:07:09] investors jobs when they wake up every
[00:07:10] morning to find a company to invest in
[00:07:13] that's their job they try to trick you
[00:07:16] into thinking that their job is to sit
[00:07:18] at their desk and wait for you to walk
[00:07:19] in the front door but that's not their
[00:07:21] job so you need to be getting the word
[00:07:22] out about your company so that they hear
[00:07:24] about your company from someone else not
[00:07:26] just you three build momentum make sure
[00:07:28] you're talking to his as many investors
[00:07:30] at the same time as possible sometimes
[00:07:32] this means cheating like often times
[00:07:34] this means doing stuff like telling the
[00:07:35] investor you're really busy and you can
[00:07:37] only meet a month from now so you can
[00:07:39] spend a whole month lining up other
[00:07:40] investors for that week that's totally
[00:07:42] fine that's totally fine the last thing
[00:07:45] is that try to focus on people
[00:07:47] especially for your first money people
[00:07:48] who understand your problem because
[00:07:50] they've had it or they have it right now
[00:07:53] oftentimes customers and potential
[00:07:54] customers can be great initial investors
[00:07:57] early stage so operations super super
[00:08:00] fast the number one problem that
[00:08:02] companies have is they spend too much
[00:08:03] money that's the number one problem they
[00:08:05] have Su spend less money pay yourself
[00:08:08] less get a crappier office just suck it
[00:08:12] up and use less money um this is the
[00:08:14] number one way you can extend your
[00:08:16] Runway and it's 100% dependent on you no
[00:08:18] one else the second thing and I can't
[00:08:20] tell you how many people do this look at
[00:08:22] how much you spend every month it's very
[00:08:24] simple just go to your bank account
[00:08:26] download your you know the the
[00:08:28] spreadsheet that says exactly every line
[00:08:30] item what you spent and read it every
[00:08:32] month if you're the CEO and you don't
[00:08:34] know what your expenses are you're not
[00:08:35] doing your job then figure out how to
[00:08:37] spend less money that seems pretty
[00:08:38] simple all right hiring one of the goals
[00:08:41] I like to kind of instill in people in
[00:08:43] hiring is figure out how you can
[00:08:45] increase the average Talent with each
[00:08:47] hire often times Founders think that
[00:08:49] they are like the smartest people in the
[00:08:51] universe Founders tend to be pretty
[00:08:53] smart but very very very willing to take
[00:08:56] on risk and so your first couple employ
[00:08:59] employees should be a lot smarter and
[00:09:01] just a little bit more risk adverse than
[00:09:03] you are if when you're hiring someone
[00:09:04] you don't think you're increasing the
[00:09:06] average intelligence of the company you
[00:09:08] made a mistake because those people are
[00:09:11] basically your hiring advertisement if
[00:09:13] those people are smart other smart
[00:09:15] people going to want to come to your
[00:09:16] company if those people are not smart
[00:09:18] everyone knows it so don't I mean one of
[00:09:21] the things I always think about is like
[00:09:23] if you can't hire someone who's smarter
[00:09:25] than you just do it yourself you know it
[00:09:27] doesn't hiring a lot of people is not
[00:09:29] not required um be fair and transparent
[00:09:32] when you give someone an offer you need
[00:09:34] to tell them how much stock they're
[00:09:35] getting they should get stock need to
[00:09:37] tell them how much stock is outstanding
[00:09:39] need to tell them whether their salary
[00:09:41] is you know typical for what you give
[00:09:43] and if not be honest a lot of the times
[00:09:46] your first employees are your most
[00:09:48] viable and if you show them loyalty
[00:09:50] they'll show you loyalty back and then
[00:09:52] the last thing is higher slow my second
[00:09:54] company social cam had three founders
[00:09:56] when we sold we had three founders no
[00:09:58] employees we didn't necessarily want it
[00:10:00] to be that way but we were able to grow
[00:10:02] a product to over 20 million downloads
[00:10:05] with three people so don't tell me that
[00:10:08] you can't do a lot with just your
[00:10:10] founding team you can do a whole lot I
[00:10:13] think Instagram sold for a billion and
[00:10:14] they were under 20 so high or slow you
[00:10:18] can do it
