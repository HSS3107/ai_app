[00:00:00] I want to say something that
[00:00:01] you would never expect to hear
from More Perfect Union.
[00:00:05] Elon Musk is right about something.
[00:00:07] Elon Musk is suing the maker of ChatGPT...
...suing OpenAI... suing OpenAI
[00:00:12] for breach of contract... by putting profit
ahead of benefiting humanity.
[00:00:16] Elon's lawsuit against OpenAI,
[00:00:19] the most recognized developer
of artificial intelligence was big news.
[00:00:24] But when I heard it, I was a bit confused.
[00:00:26] When has Elon ever been against profit?
[00:00:29] So I dug in.
[00:00:30] I read and I watched far too much
of these guys talking about AI.
[00:00:36] I think that AI will be
a technological revolution
[00:00:40] on the scale of the agricultural,
the industrial, the computer revolution.
[00:00:43] AI is about to revolutionize
digital biology and genomics
[00:00:47] and transportation
and retail. Artificial intelligence...
[00:00:51] this is... it is a renaissance.
[00:00:54] This is a world changing set of advances.
[00:00:58] By the time these lawsuits are decided,
we'll have Digital God.
[00:01:00] Digital God.
[00:01:02] I noticed three things: that the rise of
AI is inevitable, that it will change
[00:01:08] everything about our lives
and that there is a war brewing
[00:01:13] between a handful of billionaires
to seize control of it.
[00:01:18] NVIDIA
became one of the most valuable stocks
[00:01:20] of all time, producing chips for AI
[00:01:24] Microsoft reached an over $3
trillion valuation based on its AI work,
[00:01:30] and OpenAI
tripled in value in just ten months.
[00:01:34] But where do we-
[00:01:37] You and I
and everyone other than the dozen
[00:01:41] or so billionaires
duking it out for control fit in?
[00:01:44] We're already seeing plans
to replace human nurses
[00:01:47] with AI, media magnates killing jobs
to focus on cost cutting with AI,
[00:01:53] AI written drivel filling the internet,
and AI that does karaoke for you.
[00:01:59] Well, let's look at the possible
AI future through the rise of Sam Altman,
[00:02:04] CEO of OpenAI, and just one contender
in the billionaire battle for the future.
[00:02:12] Sam Altman
is the ruler of Silicon Valley startups.
[00:02:18] And that's not me saying that
he thinks that.
[00:02:21] I think the president of YC
[00:02:23] is sort of the unofficial leader
of the startup movement.
[00:02:26] YC Is YCombinator a significant venture
capital firm and tech incubator
[00:02:30] that Altman ran from 2014 to 2019.
[00:02:33] He originally connected with YC in 2008
[00:02:36] when the firm funded his app Loopd
[00:02:39] when he was 19 years old
and wore two popped collars,
[00:02:44] It was a common Silicon Valley story.
[00:02:46] They raised a ton of money
gathering a bunch of data and got in trouble
[00:02:51] for texting everyone on your phone
when you downloaded the app.
[00:02:55] Altman sold the company
and it all but disappeared.
[00:02:59] Altman landed at YCombinator,
where he rose to president in two years.
[00:03:04] Under his leadership, 
YCombinator invested in massive companies
[00:03:07] most people have heard of like Reddit,
Airbnb, Coinbase,
[00:03:12] Dropbox,
Stripe, Twitch, DoorDash and Instacart.
[00:03:16] In a lecture to Stanford computer science
students on startups, Altman quoted
[00:03:22] Peter Thiel's advice: as Peter
Thiel is going to discuss the fifth class.
[00:03:26] You want an idea
that turns into a monopoly,
[00:03:28] but you can't get a monopoly
in a big market right away.
[00:03:31] You have to find a small market
[00:03:33] in which you can get a monopoly
and then quickly expand.
[00:03:35] Quick expansion is an inherent part
of the way venture capital funded
[00:03:39] tech runs today.
[00:03:40] This is Tim O'Reilly.
[00:03:42] He's been in tech forever.
[00:03:44] And if you know phrases like 'open source'
[00:03:47] or 'Web 2.0', it's
because he popularized them.
[00:03:50] One of the big problems with today's
Silicon Valley is that it
[00:03:55] no longer really supports
free market competition.
[00:03:59] Early days of VC
you were really talking about funding
[00:04:03] insurgent companies
that had an experimental idea.
[00:04:07] Most companies didn't actually raise
massive amounts of capital,
[00:04:10] But at some point that changed.
[00:04:13] But then you fast forward to 2010
in the wake of the
[00:04:18] of the super low interest rates
is all this cheap capital
[00:04:21] and companies are just buying
market share.
[00:04:24] And I call this the Uber problem.
[00:04:26] Yeah we didn't see real competition
with different business models,
[00:04:30] different pricing.
[00:04:31] We see heavily capitalized companies
driving everybody else
[00:04:36] out of business. By growing rapidly
with a bunch of capital.
[00:04:40] Uber created an ecosystem where
if you want a cab, you need to use Uber.
[00:04:45] The old system of car services
was pretty much pushed out of existence.
[00:04:49] Uber is not an Altman company,
but DoorDash, Airbnb
[00:04:53] and other companies
that used similar strategies totally are.
[00:04:57] In 2015, we got our first hint of OpenAI.
[00:05:00] I actually just agreed to fund a company
that is not even really a company,
[00:05:03] sort of a semi-company.
[00:05:04] semi-nonprofit doing air safety research,
OpenAI is announced as not a company,
[00:05:10] but a nonprofit focused on air safety,
[00:05:14] funded and supported by Y Combinator.
[00:05:16] Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman-the LinkedIn guy,
[00:05:20] Peter Thiel, Amazon and Infosys,
basically a who's
[00:05:25] who of the people who built
the broken tech infrastructure of today.
[00:05:29] The stated goal of OpenAI
was to advance digital intelligence
[00:05:34] in the way that is most likely to benefit
[00:05:36] humanity as a whole with no shareholders
to be beholden to.
[00:05:40] We wanted to build this
with humanity's best interest at heart.
[00:05:45] That doesn't sound too bad, right?
[00:05:48] A groundbreaking new technology, 
its power available
[00:05:52] to all without any responsibility
to shareholders.
[00:05:55] But let's dig a little deeper.
[00:05:59] They say they want
to make the world better and do it safely.
[00:06:02] But what does that mean to them?
[00:06:04] Most of what Altman talks about in regards
to what OpenAI products can do
[00:06:09] seems to center
on productivity, efficiency and margins,
[00:06:13] boosting our ability
to have amazing ideas for our children
[00:06:17] to like teach themselves more than ever
before for people to be more productive.
[00:06:21] How does that make life better
for the rest of us?
[00:06:24] Well, Altman claims to have the answer in
is essay,
[00:06:27] say Moore's Law
for everything he explains.
[00:06:30] It would require simply changing
the entire economic system.
[00:06:35] Altman claims A.I.
[00:06:37] would drive down labor costs
so everything would get cheaper,
[00:06:40] and the lost jobs would be offset
by a universal basic income
[00:06:44] coming from corporate and property
tax rates with no other taxes.
[00:06:49] Which sounds great.
[00:06:51] Maybe,
but how true is that? When corporations
[00:06:54] see falling labor costs and reduce prices,
or just keep the profits for themselves?
[00:07:00] Would a flat tax and UBI mean more money
for working people or more tax
[00:07:06] cheating by the rich in social service
cuts for everyone else?
[00:07:10] And there was a running theme
through all of what Altman says:
[00:07:13] the inevitability
and the danger of artificial intelligence.
[00:07:17] Listen to this clip.
[00:07:18] You know,
[00:07:19] I think AI will probably like most likely
sort of lead to the end of the world.
[00:07:23] People like Altman benefit
from the narrative that AI is this big,
[00:07:27] scary thing, even as they're the ones
trying to build and profit from it.
[00:07:32] Here's Tim O'Reilly again.
[00:07:34] It feels a little bit
like a kind of misdirection.
[00:07:38] They're basically calling for a kind
of regulation of an extreme right to avoid
[00:07:44] the regulation of the many proximate harms
we can see today.
[00:07:49] If they were really afraid of it,
they would stop doing their research.
[00:07:52] Instead, they're racing to accelerate it
so they get a monopoly.
[00:07:56] It's a lot like the famous line
from The Wizard of Oz.
[00:07:59] Pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain.
[00:08:02] And a lot of where I spent my time
in talking about regulation is this.
[00:08:06] There is a man behind the curtain
or a series of men
[00:08:10] who are making decisions
for their business advantage.
[00:08:14] And those are the things
that we need to be regulating.
[00:08:17] Why are they moving fast to break things?
[00:08:20] I mean, in the Altman clip from before
where he says the world ending thing,
[00:08:24] he literally says this
right after you know, I think AI will
[00:08:28] probably like most likely
sort of lead to the end of the world.
[00:08:31] But in the meantime,
[00:08:33] there will be great companies created
with serious machine learning. Companies-
[00:08:37] See, it's right back to profit.
[00:08:40] But hold on.
[00:08:41] Isn't opening AI a nonprofit? Not anymore.
[00:08:48] Just three
years after the founding of Open A.I.,
[00:08:50] they transition to something
they're calling mixed profit.
[00:08:54] To do what we needed to go do.
[00:08:56] We had tried and failed enough
to raise the money as a nonprofit.
[00:08:59] We didn't see a path forward there.
[00:09:01] So we needed some of the benefits
of capitalism, but not too much.
[00:09:06] And the new Board of OpenAI is rife
with the profiteers
[00:09:10] who've been extracting value
from working people for decades.
[00:09:14] They're also not open.
[00:09:16] None of this stuff is just simply
available. An old version of ChatGPT.
[00:09:20] is free and kind of fun sometimes,
[00:09:24] but OpenAI's real product is enterprise
software, doing partnerships with other
[00:09:29] giant tech companies and loads of stuff
we don't even know about.
[00:09:33] Defense contracts included.
[00:09:35] OpenAI has a product to sell, a product
they see as having inevitable
[00:09:40] near universal proliferation,
which is a pretty damn good business plan.
[00:09:44] But it's dangerous for the rest of us.
[00:09:48] Tim O'Reilly said about the Uber problem.
[00:09:51] Here's
how it applies to AI: all of the smaller
[00:09:54] AI firms are already starting to fall
[00:09:57] because there are a couple in
in the far of OpenAI and Anthropic
[00:10:01] that are incredibly heavily funded,
that have tens of billions of dollars
[00:10:05] of capital.
[00:10:06] And we don't know that
they're the best companies.
[00:10:08] We just know that they're the ones
that big investors picked up early.
[00:10:13] And so we have a defective
kind of a market
[00:10:17] where if you really believe
in the wisdom of millions of people
[00:10:22] making independent decisions
based on optimal information
[00:10:26] to kind of work this free magic market,
we don't have that.
[00:10:30] And we have a central committee
of deep pocketed investors.
[00:10:33] It all illuminates
Elon's lawsuit against OpenAI
[00:10:36] when he and Altman had once
been such good friends.
[00:10:40] I'm looking for any video game play.
Can you give me a recommendation?
[00:10:42] Overwatch for overwatch?
[00:10:44] Yeah. That's great. Um,
[00:10:47] I named it OpenAI after open source.
[00:10:51] It is, in fact, closed source.
[00:10:53] It should be renamed.
[00:10:54] Super Closed Source for Maximum Profit AI
[00:10:57] But he has his own for sale
for profit AI
[00:11:01] that he wants to be predominant.
[00:11:03] He made it open source
in a seemingly empty gesture.
[00:11:07] But meanwhile, Nvidia, Microsoft
and Google all want to take control
[00:11:11] of the tech that will change our future
and destroy our jobs.
[00:11:16] It doesn't matter that these guys say
they're doing it for good.
[00:11:19] It matters what they are actually doing.
[00:11:22] Look at the dawn of the internet itself
or web 2.0
[00:11:26] that's social media and user
generated content.
[00:11:30] All of that seems great.
[00:11:32] And yeah, the modern Internet
has obviously had a lot of clear benefits,
[00:11:36] but it was also pretty quickly ruined
by giant corporations and profit motive.
[00:11:42] We're already starting
to see effects of the power grab.
[00:11:45] Nvidia, the main producer of the chips
used for the AI, is partnering
[00:11:49] with a company that wants to replace
nurses with an AI that costs $9 an hour.
[00:11:55] Look at anything from the history
of the American medicine industry.
[00:11:59] Will a new low cost tool actually helped
patients or just pad investor pockets?
[00:12:05] Companies are using AI to do job
interviews and it's shutting out
[00:12:08] applicants unfairly
and on a simply annoying level.
[00:12:13] They were spitting out content
[00:12:14] that's making the Internet
even more unusable than it already was.
[00:12:19] AI generated LinkedIn comments.
[00:12:21] Why don't you just not post anything
if you don't have anything to say?
[00:12:25] So what are we going to do about this?
[00:12:28] Well, let's turn to Sam Altman for advice.
[00:12:32] He has what he calls
the more good guys than bad guys approach.
[00:12:37] He wrote in that Moore's Law essay,
"There are bad humans,
[00:12:41] but all humans are within a magnitude
are as powerful as one another
[00:12:45] and the good humans
and together to stop the bad humans.
[00:12:50] It's been that way through all of history
so far."
[00:12:53] What if the bad humans are actually
the people building the system,
[00:12:57] being built entirely on past profits
[00:13:00] and monopoly,
advancing as quickly as possible.
[00:13:03] Then we need more good guys.
[00:13:05] And we've got up there like 12 people.
[00:13:08] What if we all stand up and say no?
[00:13:12] When electricity was first becoming
widespread, it was still dangerous
[00:13:16] for the low paid workers
who were setting up the systems.
[00:13:20] But those workers stood together
and formed the International Brotherhood
[00:13:24] of Electrical Workers-
[00:13:25] That's the electrician's union-
to demand safer jobs and better wages.
[00:13:30] It worked.
[00:13:31] And it didn't hamper progress.
[00:13:33] We clearly have electricity today, right?
[00:13:37] That same concept
[00:13:38] applies to AI: remember the writers
strike?
[00:13:41] The Screenwriters Guild stood up and said
no to taking their jobs.
[00:13:47] Senator Bernie Sanders just introduced
legislation for a shorter workweek.
[00:13:50] Do we continue the trend?
[00:13:52] The technology
only benefits the people on top.
[00:13:55] Or do we demand that
these transformational changes benefit
[00:14:00] working people?
[00:14:01] And one of the benefits
must be a lower workweek.
[00:14:06] If A.I.
[00:14:06] is going to make workers
more productive and labor cheaper,
[00:14:09] workers should be able
to take advantage of it. A.I.
[00:14:13] cannot exist without being trained on all
that humanity has done before.
[00:14:18] That's literally how
[00:14:20] the way most people interact with A.I.
[00:14:23] was built
by reading a bunch of stuff online
[00:14:26] and then synthesizing it so it can talk.
[00:14:29] If all of this is built on the labor
of all of humanity,
[00:14:33] then it should be all
of humanity that benefits.
