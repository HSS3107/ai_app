[00:00:00] Tasked with designing 400 years into the future, 2 Arcadians set out with the mission
[00:00:05] to both warn humanity of the dangers of the current climate conditions and show
[00:00:10] our species its great potential should we 
work together, and so we begin known to the  
[00:00:17] arcadians as the Reckoning in the year 2040 
where society's efforts to push initiatives  
[00:00:23] and agendas of sustainability failed due to 
Humanity's obsession with over consumerism
[00:00:30] Next we have, the dystopian era, in the year 2070, where the living conditions are
[00:00:39] inconceivably depressing, unhygienic and inhumane. Also with the sheer mismanagement of waste dumping
[00:00:49] around our beloved planet in space, leading world governments to assemble the people of the nations. 
[00:00:57] after much trial and tribulation we move on to 
the year 2100 The Retreat devised as a plan for  
[00:01:05] the rest & recovery of our natural world in 
the year 2100 Humanity looks to live away from  
[00:01:12] the surface for 50 years. And so a new chapter 
begins. with the return the year 2200. And upon  
[00:01:21] returning to the surface, Humanity finds that 
the plan to allow nature to once again flourish  
[00:01:29] worked outstandingly with all the greatest 
scientists, pioneers, futurists and imagineers  
[00:01:36] devising methods of revolving the current 
society's technology and architecture around trans-botanism
[00:01:43] and with efforts of prosperity Humanity 
begins rebuilding with nature in the year 2250.
[00:01:54] the imaginators and Visionaries of today in 2250 
use biomimetic 4D printing in order to grow
[00:02:03] architecture, all from natural matter artificially 
reproduced and edited for our needs and once again  
[00:02:12] assemble a harmonious routine life into local 
neighborhoods. And just when our technological  
[00:02:19] development peaked as we thought, in comes the New 
Frontier of what we consider to be the nature of  
[00:02:27] life itself we've finally done it. The singularity 
is here. Humans have merged with AI and uploaded  
[00:02:38] themselves to the digital realm leaving behind all 
manners of physicality therefore solidifying our  
[00:02:45] position as a type one civilization with 
our eyes fixated on the next challenge  
[00:02:53] brought to you by Arcadia foundry's 
design team. Thank you for watching
