Description: Krishna Explains Kaliyuga To Pandavas

As per Shrimad Bhagavad on the ninth day of the Mahabharata war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, the third yuga which is the Dwapar Yuga had ended and the last yuga which is the Kali yuga had begun. However, because of the power of lord Krishna, Kali could not spread throughout the earth and was restricted to the battlefields and war grounds. Although the full effect of Kali yuga, started after the demise of Shri Krishna, Krishna knew very well what would Kali Yuga bring along. As per the Uddhava Gita and Shrimad Bhagavatam, Once the four Pandavas Arjuna, Bheema, Nakul and Sahadeva asked Krishna, What is Kali Yuga? ". Krishna smiled and said "Let me demonstrate to you, the situation of Kaliyuga." He took a bow and four arrows and shot them in four directions and ordered the four Pandavas to go and bring them back. Each of the four Pandavas went in the four different directions to search for the arrows.

[00:00:16] which is the dwapar yoga had ended and
[00:00:18] the last yoga which is the Kali yoga had
[00:00:21] begun however because of the power of
[00:00:24] Lord Krishna Kali could not spread
[00:00:26] throughout the Earth and was restricted
[00:00:29] to the battlefield and
[00:00:30] warrs although the full effect of Koga
[00:00:34] started after the demise of Shri Krishna
[00:00:37] Krishna knew very well what would Kaluga
[00:00:39] bring along as for the udhav Gita and
[00:00:42] shrimat bhagwat once the four pandas
[00:00:46] Arjun beim nakul and sahadev asked
[00:00:50] Krishna what is kuga Krishna smiled and
[00:00:54] said let me demonstrate to you the
[00:00:56] situation of Koga he took a bow and four
[00:01:00] arrows and shot them in four directions
[00:01:03] and ordered the four pandavas to go and
[00:01:05] bring them back each of the four pandas
[00:01:09] went into the four different directions
[00:01:11] to search for the
[00:01:12] arrows when Arjuna picked an arrow he
[00:01:15] heard a very sweet voice he turned
[00:01:18] around and saw a cuckoo singing in a
[00:01:20] spellbinding voice but was also eating
[00:01:23] the Flesh of a live rabbit Arjuna was
[00:01:26] very surprised to see the G react by
[00:01:29] such a divine bird and he left the place
[00:01:33] immediately beima went and picked the
[00:01:35] arrow from a place where there were five
[00:01:38] Wells
[00:01:39] situated the four Wells were surrounding
[00:01:42] a single well the four Wells were
[00:01:45] overflowing with very sweet water as if
[00:01:47] they were not able to hold water and
[00:01:50] surprisingly the well in the middle of
[00:01:53] these four overflowing Wells was
[00:01:55] completely empty bishma was puzzled at
[00:01:58] this sight nakul was returning to the
[00:02:01] place after picking up the arrow he
[00:02:04] stopped at a place where a cow was about
[00:02:06] to give birth after giving birth the cow
[00:02:09] started licking the calf but continued
[00:02:12] to lick it even after the calf was clean
[00:02:15] with great difficulty people were able
[00:02:17] to separate them and by that time the
[00:02:20] Cal was injured
[00:02:23] badly nakul was puzzled by the behavior
[00:02:25] of such a calm animal sahadev picked an
[00:02:30] which fell near a mountain and saw a big
[00:02:32] boulder falling the boulder was crushing
[00:02:36] the rocks and the Big Trees on its way
[00:02:38] down but the same boulder was stopped by
[00:02:40] a small
[00:02:41] plant sah was so amazed at the sight the
[00:02:46] four pandas returned to Lord Krishna
[00:02:48] with the arrows they placed the arrows
[00:02:51] at Lord krishna's feet and requested him
[00:02:53] to explain the meaning of the mysterious
[00:02:56] sights that each of them had witnessed
[00:02:59] Lord Krishna smiled and began explaining
[00:03:02] to the first scenario of Arjuna Krishna
[00:03:05] says in Koga the pious men and Saints
[00:03:08] will be like the cuckoo they will always
[00:03:11] have sweet words but they will exploit
[00:03:14] and inflict pain on their followers like
[00:03:16] the cucko was doing to the poor
[00:03:19] rabbit Lord Krishna continued he said in
[00:03:23] Koga the poor and the rich will live in
[00:03:25] the same locality the rich will be
[00:03:28] overflowing with Fortune yet they will
[00:03:31] not spare a single coin to help the poor
[00:03:34] like the dry well received not a drop of
[00:03:37] water from the surrounding Wells that
[00:03:40] were overflowing with water Lord Krishna
[00:03:43] looked at nakula and said in Koga
[00:03:47] parents will love their children so
[00:03:48] intensely that they will end up spoiling
[00:03:51] them in the same manner that the cow
[00:03:53] destroyed its SCF by licking it too much
[00:03:56] parents will disrupt their children's
[00:03:58] lives with too much love the attachment
[00:04:02] with children will be so much that
[00:04:04] parents will become blind to all of
[00:04:06] their relationships and deeds in their
[00:04:09] lives to sahadev Lord Krishna said the
[00:04:12] people of Kaluga will rush to their Doom
[00:04:15] like the boulder you saw large trees are
[00:04:18] symbolic of Assets in life like
[00:04:20] relatives family friends and wealth none
[00:04:24] of these will help them escape the Doom
[00:04:27] the plant stands for the name of God
[00:04:30] a weak but faithful recalling of God's
[00:04:33] name will help them escape this Doom a
[00:04:36] dialogue between Krishna and goddess
[00:04:38] ganga found in the Brahma vuran also
[00:04:42] describes the first 10,000 years of
[00:04:45] Kaluga in this dialogue ganga asks
[00:04:48] Krishna what will her situation be when
[00:04:51] kalyuga
[00:04:52] arises Krishna tells ganga to remain on
[00:04:55] Earth for the first 5,000 years of
[00:04:57] Kaluga
[00:04:59] he says during Koga the Lord remains on
[00:05:03] Earth for the first 10,000 years till
[00:05:06] that time the images of gods and the
[00:05:09] scriptures besides the puranas are also
[00:05:12] adored for half that period which is the
[00:05:15] first 5,000 years ganga and all the holy
[00:05:18] places would also enjoy their sanctity
[00:05:22] and during that time the village deities
[00:05:25] would also be woried besides the
[00:05:27] intellectuals and The Vedas but later
[00:05:30] after the first 10,000 years the world
[00:05:33] will lose all its
[00:05:34] righteousness and people will be corrupt
[00:05:37] and will perform evil on a daily basis
[00:05:40] people will fight over Petty things like
[00:05:43] religion and land diseases and
[00:05:46] afflictions plague every human no one
[00:05:49] will know the vas in its entirety and in
[00:05:51] its true
[00:05:53] Essence even hard work would refuse to
[00:05:55] pay good results and people who would
[00:05:58] perform bad Deeds sit on the top of the
[00:06:00] societal ladder people will not think
[00:06:03] twice before cutting down trees or
[00:06:06] destroying Groves even though having the
[00:06:09] outward appearance of saints people will
[00:06:11] indulge in trade and Commercial
[00:06:14] activity Whoever has money will be
[00:06:17] considered of noble birth and as having
[00:06:20] good
[00:06:20] qualities the one who has the power in
[00:06:23] his hand will be able to steer the
[00:06:25] course of Justice in his
[00:06:27] favor the one who La money and cannot
[00:06:31] bribe will be deprived of Justice by the
[00:06:34] courts people will consider far off
[00:06:36] water bodies as pilgrimage but neglect
[00:06:40] the pilgrimages near to them for example
[00:06:43] living with parents and serving them
[00:06:45] brahans will start performing the tasks
[00:06:48] which otherwise sudras are supposed to
[00:06:50] perform brahans will abstain from the
[00:06:53] sacrifices and the study of Vedas when
[00:06:56] the end of Kaluga is near the chhatria
[00:06:59] will will become the Thorns of the world
[00:07:01] they will not protect others people will
[00:07:04] stop make offerings to their ancestors
[00:07:07] men will have a shorter lifespan and
[00:07:10] become feeble in strength they will be
[00:07:13] weak in energy and Valor under the
[00:07:16] burden of excess taxation householders
[00:07:19] will turn into
[00:07:21] robbers in ashram brahmacharis will
[00:07:24] indulge in evil conduct and submit
[00:07:27] themselves to the desires of the world
[00:07:29] the ashrams will be full of showoffs who
[00:07:32] are experts in the art of living off of
[00:07:34] the food of others when Kaluga
[00:07:37] degenerates even further people who
[00:07:40] follow Dharma are seen to have an even
[00:07:42] smaller life towards the end of Kaluga
[00:07:46] the young one acts like the old the
[00:07:49] conduct that suits the young is seen in
[00:07:51] the old the old will think like children
[00:07:54] and the young will have the intelligence
[00:07:56] of the old in Kaluga people will
[00:07:59] manipulate the truth because of this
[00:08:02] harm done to the truth lifespans are
[00:08:05] shortened men will rob possessions of
[00:08:07] others even that of widows men will
[00:08:11] happily accept gifts given by the evil
[00:08:14] men will be addicted to meat and liquor
[00:08:17] and will be weak in Dharma the only Mark
[00:08:20] of evil will be poverty
