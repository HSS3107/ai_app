[00:00:00] okay let me tell you practical AI
[00:00:01] releases have been heating up recently
[00:00:03] this week we got open ai's Voice
[00:00:05] Assistant upgrades to various products
[00:00:06] like Google's notebook LM and their very
[00:00:08] best models meta released a bunch of AI
[00:00:11] features and a new version of their
[00:00:12] llama models and so much more me and my
[00:00:14] team researched all of it tested a lot
[00:00:16] of it and in this week's episode of aus
[00:00:18] you can use we serve it on a silver
[00:00:20] platter to any screen of your choice
[00:00:22] let's begin all right so the big story
[00:00:23] of this week obviously was open AI
[00:00:25] releasing the advanced voice mode now a
[00:00:27] few updates since my release video that
[00:00:29] I recorded put it right away first
[00:00:31] things first the roll out is complete it
[00:00:33] actually took them less than 24 hours to
[00:00:35] get this into every plus and team
[00:00:37] subscribers phones that's really amazing
[00:00:40] except that people in the EU UK and a
[00:00:42] few more countries didn't get access due
[00:00:44] to regulations it was actually
[00:00:46] interesting that Sam for the very first
[00:00:48] time tweeted about this fact and he
[00:00:50] mentioned that these jurisdictions
[00:00:51] require additional external review
[00:00:54] meaning we'll get the future it's just a
[00:00:56] question of time but I myself I'm in
[00:00:57] Europe and check out my phone right here
[00:01:00] hey what's up not much just here to chat
[00:01:02] that's advanced voice mode and I shared
[00:01:04] the step-by-step way on how to access
[00:01:06] this if you're from Europe and want to
[00:01:07] get it it's simple you uninstall the app
[00:01:09] you connect to a VPN doesn't matter
[00:01:11] which one a lot of phones have this
[00:01:12] built in already just search your
[00:01:14] settings then you reinstall the App log
[00:01:16] back in and voila you have advanced
[00:01:19] voice mode on your phone so that's a
[00:01:20] nice little workaround I want to point
[00:01:22] out one more thing in the video that
[00:01:23] uploaded right away I gave you a bunch
[00:01:25] of presets matter of fact I gave you
[00:01:27] over 15 different prompts that you can
[00:01:29] run run in there all of them take
[00:01:31] different angles and assume that you
[00:01:32] have a certain profession and then
[00:01:34] there's different role playing or
[00:01:35] brainstorming scenarios that you could
[00:01:37] engage in and my hope is that these
[00:01:39] prompts will spark your creativity and
[00:01:40] show you what's possible here now I did
[00:01:42] make one mistake though I made the video
[00:01:44] as soon as it released I didn't have it
[00:01:46] on my phone yet I said that you simply
[00:01:48] need to copy them from the video
[00:01:49] description right here I will actually
[00:01:51] copy them directly from the product that
[00:01:53] we developed with 33,000 prompts for the
[00:01:56] voice assistant in total so for example
[00:01:58] here with the roast comedian and if you
[00:02:00] want to generate fresh material you
[00:02:02] would just copy it from your very own
[00:02:03] copy of the notion template heading over
[00:02:06] to cat GPT and the correct thing is not
[00:02:08] actually posting it as a message here
[00:02:09] you go to the custom instructions which
[00:02:12] you can access in the settings
[00:02:14] personalization customize chat GPT and
[00:02:16] here in the first box you just paste
[00:02:18] this preset save and now you set up your
[00:02:21] voice assistant to act as a rast
[00:02:23] comedian that will help you prepare
[00:02:25] fresh new materials AK brand new jokes
[00:02:27] you just have to make sure to be in a
[00:02:29] brand new chat and now if you engage
[00:02:31] with the voice assistant all right let's
[00:02:33] begin awesome give me a current event or
[00:02:36] pop culture topic and I'll cook up some
[00:02:37] roast angles for you yeah what about Sam
[00:02:40] ultman now actually owning a part of
[00:02:43] open AI oh that's interesting Sam mman
[00:02:46] owning a part of open AI well I guess
[00:02:49] when it comes to AI Sam's all in he's
[00:02:52] got more investment in Bots than a
[00:02:54] Sci-Fi villain now he's not just calling
[00:02:56] the shots he's owning them too oh oh
[00:03:00] brother this guy stinks okay I mean fair
[00:03:04] enough can you be a little more ruthless
[00:03:06] and comedic got it so Sam mman now owns
[00:03:10] a piece of open AI looks like someone's
[00:03:12] taking owning the future a bit too
[00:03:14] literally this guy so deep into AI soon
[00:03:17] he'll be arguing with his toaster about
[00:03:20] who controls the bread okay I don't know
[00:03:22] about those jokes but I think you get
[00:03:24] the point this is the way you set it up
[00:03:26] there's a bunch of presets I gave you to
[00:03:28] show you the possibilities and we
[00:03:29] created an entire product which is all
[00:03:31] about showing you what's possible for a
[00:03:33] grand total of 1,600 professions this is
[00:03:35] how you correctly set it up just wanted
[00:03:37] to put that correction out there beyond
[00:03:38] that the voice assistant has been well
[00:03:41] probably the most entertaining release
[00:03:43] in AI ever I would even State because it
[00:03:46] has one standout feature and that's
[00:03:48] imitating voices now it's lobotomized
[00:03:50] enough so that it can't address specific
[00:03:52] names my name is Jeff so if you name
[00:03:54] celebrities and just say speak in their
[00:03:56] style it won't do it but you could
[00:03:58] broadly describe the characteristics of
[00:04:00] That Celebrity and then often it will
[00:04:02] work or you just go with something
[00:04:04] simple like in this case I want you to
[00:04:06] roast Marvel for their degrading movie
[00:04:08] quality but do it in the voice of a
[00:04:10] Russian mobster I can't do specific
[00:04:13] voices but imagine this with a thick
[00:04:16] Russian accent Marvel movies they used
[00:04:19] to be like rare caviar now they are more
[00:04:22] like water down bed served in Every
[00:04:25] Corner Cafe no yes my friend I think you
[00:04:29] get the points you you could even tell
[00:04:30] it to imitate your very own accent and
[00:04:32] it will do that all right now I want you
[00:04:34] to roast the Apple for the lack of
[00:04:37] innovation over the past years and I
[00:04:39] will have my cigarette in between
[00:04:41] listening to your yapping go ahead do it
[00:04:44] in my accent too
[00:04:51] oh no no no no no
[00:05:00] oh no my French exit was so bad that it
[00:05:02] actually fought I was French I don't
[00:05:04] know what to think of that but as you
[00:05:06] can see you can make it switch voices
[00:05:07] it's multilingual you can make it switch
[00:05:09] Styles it's incredible and with all of
[00:05:11] the prompts for inspiration from the
[00:05:12] first video the opportunities here are
[00:05:15] truly endless so go out and enjoy it I
[00:05:17] just wanted to tease that we're already
[00:05:18] preparing a big video with various use
[00:05:21] cases where we go a little deeper into
[00:05:23] different use cases for various
[00:05:25] professions so look forward to that on
[00:05:27] the YouTube channel and until then if
[00:05:28] you don't have the plus plan you can
[00:05:30] actually go ahead and use Gemini's
[00:05:32] alternative it's not as good but you can
[00:05:34] get a one Monon free trial and also get
[00:05:36] a taste of The Voice Assistant even
[00:05:38] grock rolled out some voice features now
[00:05:40] when I updated my app it now has voice
[00:05:43] input it can speak yet so next to that
[00:05:45] and meta AI announcements that also
[00:05:47] integrated the voice feature into meta
[00:05:49] AI also not available in Europe we just
[00:05:51] got all of these different voice
[00:05:53] assistants throughout the past weeks
[00:05:55] open AI being the best one by far all
[00:05:58] right so with the next tool I'll show
[00:05:59] you how to build one of the most
[00:06:00] important things you can have in 2024
[00:06:03] your own websites that is clean yet
[00:06:04] professional and to do this let me
[00:06:06] introduce you to hostinger the sponsor
[00:06:08] of today's video hostinger makes it easy
[00:06:09] to build and host all kinds of websites
[00:06:12] that's a great platform for anybody new
[00:06:14] to website building especially with all
[00:06:16] the AI features that they recently added
[00:06:18] they even have this AI website builder
[00:06:19] that I'll show you now all I need to do
[00:06:21] is give it a few descriptive words and
[00:06:23] VOA you have a website so once you sign
[00:06:25] up for the link in the description below
[00:06:27] you will be faced with this welcome page
[00:06:29] if you decide to go with a business plan
[00:06:31] it even comes with a free domain so you
[00:06:32] could just go here and look for yep I
[00:06:35] could just get the website Advantage
[00:06:36] right here but now let's get into the
[00:06:38] promise step by step of building the
[00:06:39] actual website I'll just click set up
[00:06:41] here with the business web hosting I
[00:06:43] will be done in no time I'm doing this
[00:06:45] for myself or my business I'll create a
[00:06:47] website I'll go with the hosting a
[00:06:49] website builder because this is the
[00:06:50] simplest alternative right here I'll
[00:06:52] secure the domain for myself and less
[00:06:54] than a minute later I can start creating
[00:06:56] my website with AI I'll make this a
[00:06:58] portfolio page for this imaginary
[00:07:00] project which is AI website gallery and
[00:07:02] I'll keep this really simple but the
[00:07:03] more detail you give it the more it will
[00:07:05] incorporate and that's it I'll hand this
[00:07:07] off to the AI and there it is a clean
[00:07:09] and professional website with our
[00:07:11] various projects all I have to do now is
[00:07:12] change out all the data like the
[00:07:14] pictures or the text but this is
[00:07:16] absolutely beautiful functional I can
[00:07:18] just go to edit and change all of the
[00:07:20] media just like so they even help you
[00:07:22] with the simple checklist let's be real
[00:07:24] could this be any easier if you want to
[00:07:25] use this yourself check out hostinger
[00:07:27] first link in the video's description
[00:07:29] and now let's move move on to the next
[00:07:30] piece of aanus that you can use okay
[00:07:32] next up we have some major improvements
[00:07:33] from Gemini's models namely 1.5 Pro and
[00:07:36] Flash this is sort of like GPT 40 and
[00:07:38] this one is like GPT 40 mini so these
[00:07:41] are all API improvements but the 1.5 Pro
[00:07:44] API has been really good I talked about
[00:07:46] Google's AI Studio before it has the
[00:07:48] biggest context window the model is
[00:07:50] really capable and you can upload videos
[00:07:52] to it straight up it's the only model
[00:07:53] that can do that now it has 50% reduced
[00:07:56] prices both models have higher rate
[00:07:57] limits two times faster output and lower
[00:08:00] latency this is going to play really
[00:08:02] well with the voice mode which they need
[00:08:04] to upgrade further to catch up with open
[00:08:05] AI but nevertheless these are some major
[00:08:07] upgrades and if you check out all the
[00:08:08] benchmarks although they didn't release
[00:08:10] new models Gemini 1.5 Pro improved so
[00:08:13] much since May this is kind of
[00:08:15] ridiculous Google is really catching up
[00:08:16] they're not making big waves like open
[00:08:18] AI with every single release but these
[00:08:20] products are getting super solid and
[00:08:23] fast and next up talking about new llms
[00:08:25] we got to talk about the brand new
[00:08:27] models from meta namely lree .2 this is
[00:08:30] the first time meta is open sourcing
[00:08:31] multimodal llms meaning they can also
[00:08:34] process images but it doesn't end there
[00:08:36] because with this family of models they
[00:08:38] open sourced a bunch more than just
[00:08:39] Vision models there's a bunch of them
[00:08:41] that are really small meant for on
[00:08:44] device usage on phones and because these
[00:08:46] are open source people can build with
[00:08:47] them now but some of them are really
[00:08:49] specialized towards specific use cases
[00:08:52] I'm talking about these super small 1B
[00:08:54] and fre billion parameter models that
[00:08:56] are specialized for one thing and meta
[00:08:58] just doesn't care they open sourcing it
[00:09:00] all right here so people can start
[00:09:01] building apps on top of this or simply
[00:09:04] include one step in their workflow
[00:09:06] enabling workflows for developers that
[00:09:08] are just not feasible if you're calling
[00:09:09] something like the big chat GPT models
[00:09:11] that have no way of running locally as
[00:09:14] you can see in these little gifs all of
[00:09:15] the generation happens on device because
[00:09:17] it's local and also as mentioned these
[00:09:19] include Vision models so if you're
[00:09:21] following the show you would have
[00:09:22] noticed that over the past months
[00:09:23] actually a lot of vision models came out
[00:09:25] some of the best ones came out of China
[00:09:27] but now we have llama
[00:09:29] beating some real contenders like GPT 40
[00:09:31] mini or claw-free hiu that's their
[00:09:34] smallest model but again I cannot
[00:09:35] overstate the fact that these models you
[00:09:36] can download and use whereas gbt 4 mini
[00:09:39] you can't you need to pay for the API
[00:09:41] and go to the Internet this you could
[00:09:42] just run locally all you need to do is
[00:09:44] flat this information and then you can
[00:09:45] download the models or they're also
[00:09:47] available over on hugging phase so look
[00:09:49] I realized for most viewers of this show
[00:09:50] this is not something they'll be doing
[00:09:52] right away but just know that meta is
[00:09:53] not stopping on its conquest of leveling
[00:09:55] the playing field for all players which
[00:09:57] in my opinion is really good because now
[00:09:59] we have a open-source alternative that
[00:10:01] anyone can build on that is as capable
[00:10:04] as GPT 40 Mini Plus developers can
[00:10:06] easily build things like mobile writing
[00:10:08] assistance without needing to enter the
[00:10:10] wall Garden of something like apple
[00:10:12] intelligence but I just quickly want to
[00:10:13] touch on meta's AI announcements there
[00:10:15] have been some incredible things in
[00:10:16] there I mean obviously the Orion glasses
[00:10:18] were mindblowing I guess most of us are
[00:10:21] in Tech so if you haven't seen this you
[00:10:22] need to check this out this is probably
[00:10:24] the future Computing platform especially
[00:10:25] if you pair it with multimodal AI but my
[00:10:28] point here is a different one some of
[00:10:29] these meta AI announcements are exactly
[00:10:31] what I've been preaching for a while and
[00:10:34] it might be helpful to contextualize all
[00:10:35] the content in this weekly show because
[00:10:37] we didn't see anything revolutionary out
[00:10:39] of the meta AI announcements there's
[00:10:41] photo editing with prompts inside of
[00:10:43] their meta AI app there's a voice
[00:10:45] assistant there's AI avatars and they're
[00:10:47] adding voice dubbing to their shorts
[00:10:49] meaning you can upload in one language
[00:10:51] and then it automatically translates
[00:10:53] into others it's not perfect arguably
[00:10:55] there's even better tools out there
[00:10:57] right now if you were to do it manually
[00:10:59] but the point is all of these
[00:11:00] innovations that we look at week by week
[00:11:02] eventually will be gobbled up by these
[00:11:04] Giants and implemented into their
[00:11:06] applications and as they already have
[00:11:07] the distribution with Instagram Facebook
[00:11:10] WhatsApp and messenger they don't need
[00:11:12] to be first they let everything shake
[00:11:13] out and then adopt the best features
[00:11:15] into their apps like they did with the
[00:11:17] meta AI announcements I mean heck just a
[00:11:19] week ago we looked at an open source
[00:11:21] model that does photo editing just like
[00:11:22] this new feature and soon it's going to
[00:11:24] be available inside of Instagram okay so
[00:11:26] I have to show you this app that I was
[00:11:28] really excited to find because we talked
[00:11:30] about notebook LM before most other
[00:11:32] people actually talked about it I'm kind
[00:11:34] of excited about the fact that we
[00:11:35] featured an episode of news you can use
[00:11:37] with the brand new voice updates and
[00:11:38] then about four to 5 days after upload a
[00:11:41] lot of the internet caught onto it and I
[00:11:43] won't take the credit for that our
[00:11:44] community disc discovered it in there
[00:11:46] there was a lot of conversations around
[00:11:47] notebook LM for a few months already
[00:11:49] concretely the educator sub Community
[00:11:51] was using it all the time of their
[00:11:52] students or to research different
[00:11:55] projects my point being that notebook LM
[00:11:57] is still really really good and it
[00:11:59] doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon
[00:12:01] because right now they shipped two new
[00:12:03] updates one of which I was asking for
[00:12:06] since the beginning it's the ability to
[00:12:08] include YouTube links into your sources
[00:12:10] a quick recap of notebook LM is that on
[00:12:12] the left side there's a bunch of sources
[00:12:13] you can add different articles different
[00:12:15] PDFs and now also YouTube videos that it
[00:12:18] then transcribes and takes into its
[00:12:20] knowledge base then at the bottom you
[00:12:21] have a chatbot which can suggest prompts
[00:12:24] and those prompts run on the entire
[00:12:25] knowledge base of your notebook so if
[00:12:27] you're researching a new topic you just
[00:12:28] throw everything in there and then you
[00:12:30] talk to the entire knowledge base and
[00:12:32] the standout feature that caught
[00:12:33] everyone of g a few weeks ago was the
[00:12:36] audio overview which generated the audio
[00:12:38] podcast that just sounded really really
[00:12:40] good really human so you could listen to
[00:12:42] audio summary as presented in a podcast
[00:12:45] conversation between two human sounding
[00:12:47] voices now these audio overviews are
[00:12:49] accessible via public URL so you can
[00:12:51] share them more easily and you can add
[00:12:53] YouTube videos to your sources which is
[00:12:56] massive cuz let's be real YouTube is one
[00:12:57] of the best sources for information in
[00:12:59] our generation and now you can throw the
[00:13:01] YouTube videos in there and generate
[00:13:02] these podcast summaries and this week
[00:13:04] here's another piece of AI news you can
[00:13:06] use that you could actually build
[00:13:07] something interesting on this feature
[00:13:09] caught so much popularity inside of
[00:13:11] notebook LM that a brand new open source
[00:13:13] alternative to it popped up this week
[00:13:15] it's called PDF to audio and it does
[00:13:17] exactly that you can upload PDFs and it
[00:13:20] turns it into audio now the interesting
[00:13:22] thing here is you can use a variety of
[00:13:24] models if your API key supports 01
[00:13:25] preview you could even use 01 preview to
[00:13:28] process process all the text from the
[00:13:30] PDFs and generate a summary that way but
[00:13:32] at the end of the day you can pick
[00:13:33] multiple speaker voices and create audio
[00:13:36] podcasts similar to the ones in Notebook
[00:13:38] element how similar well we wondered too
[00:13:41] and that's why we went in and tested
[00:13:42] this right away so let me put my
[00:13:43] headphones on and have a listen we did
[00:13:45] this based on Sam alman's blog post
[00:13:47] here's the version from PDF to audio
[00:13:48] today we dive into a fascinating topic
[00:13:51] the intelligence age it's a term that
[00:13:53] sounds futuristic doesn't it the
[00:13:55] intelligence age is as thrilling as it
[00:13:57] sounds essentially it's a term that
[00:13:59] signifies our era where artificial
[00:14:01] intelligence often abbreviated as AI is
[00:14:04] a major Force shaping economies
[00:14:06] societies and even personal Lifestyles
[00:14:09] so you get the point pretty
[00:14:10] straightforward with standards Texas
[00:14:12] speech quality that we're used to and
[00:14:13] here's the notebook LM audio comparison
[00:14:15] we're going to unpack Sam alman's latest
[00:14:17] on AI and the future intelligence age
[00:14:20] and it's a fascinating read bold
[00:14:22] predictions some really nuanced
[00:14:24] arguments we're talking AI tutors for
[00:14:26] your kids AI managing your Healthcare
[00:14:28] even reshaping what work means so there
[00:14:30] you go I would say it's pretty clear
[00:14:32] that notebook LM is better but this
[00:14:33] thing is open source meaning you could
[00:14:35] build this into your own applications or
[00:14:37] build something completely new from it I
[00:14:39] don't know I was really excited to find
[00:14:40] this because in my mind the point of
[00:14:41] this show is really getting you ahead of
[00:14:43] the curve so you can use some of these
[00:14:45] opportunities to your own Advantage just
[00:14:47] like I did by discovering cat GPT on the
[00:14:49] day of its release all it takes is being
[00:14:51] slightly ahead of the her and you can
[00:14:52] potentially build your entire life upon
[00:14:54] it all right in the creative Department
[00:14:56] this week there have been some
[00:14:57] interesting upgrades because first of
[00:14:58] all we got the state-ofthe-art 3D model
[00:15:01] generator and while this is not really
[00:15:02] my area of expertise it's been really
[00:15:04] interesting to watch developments in
[00:15:06] this space and this new model tripo 2.0
[00:15:09] is supposed to be state-of-the-art so
[00:15:11] what me and the team went ahead and did
[00:15:12] is we tested tripo 2.0 versus tripo 1.0
[00:15:15] versus stable diffusions 3D model
[00:15:17] generator I have all the results of the
[00:15:19] testing right here I'm seeing this for
[00:15:20] the first time myself and I'm just
[00:15:22] curious to see how far 3D model
[00:15:25] generation with AI has come over the
[00:15:27] past year or two so let's just start
[00:15:28] with triple 1.4 again these are the same
[00:15:31] input images okay this is very crude
[00:15:33] let's look at triple
[00:15:35] 2.0 oh wow massive difference in detail
[00:15:38] right okay what about stable Fast 3D
[00:15:41] stable diffusions 3D generator wow hold
[00:15:43] up this is way better am I right okay
[00:15:45] what about typography this is triple
[00:15:48] 1.4 that's okay triple 2.0 that looks
[00:15:52] way more like wood no doubt comparing it
[00:15:54] to stable diffusion well okay that's
[00:15:56] just weird maybe a food truck stable
[00:15:59] diffusion versus tripo 2.0 yeah these
[00:16:01] details are matched hold up this
[00:16:02] generator is actually really good I mean
[00:16:05] sure the text is not perfect but this
[00:16:07] might be usable in the game whereas the
[00:16:09] stable diffusion results are you know
[00:16:11] they tried I guess yeah and 1.4 is not
[00:16:13] even comparable this is not even close I
[00:16:15] didn't expect this to be this big of a
[00:16:17] jump okay let's do something hard like
[00:16:19] this steampunk Warrior triple 1.4 versus
[00:16:22] Triple 2.0 right here wow the level of
[00:16:25] detail so look is certainly not perfect
[00:16:27] but I think this really crosses a line
[00:16:28] where I would say this is good enough if
[00:16:30] you put this into a living world a game
[00:16:33] animation whatever I wouldn't mind this
[00:16:35] this little ghost should be pretty
[00:16:36] simple to generate so let's have a look
[00:16:39] yeah it's clearly it's just better in
[00:16:41] every single case and I have to say just
[00:16:42] as a beginner looking at this it's an
[00:16:45] impressive tool and you can try it out
[00:16:46] yourself for free on the tripo 3d. a
[00:16:49] links in the description as per usual
[00:16:51] all right next up I want to show you
[00:16:52] this AI image edit you can think of it
[00:16:54] as a canvas that uses AI to generate
[00:16:57] different aspects of this and this to is
[00:16:58] not new but in the 5.0 version they
[00:17:00] introduced this canvas where you can
[00:17:02] really create things from scratch then
[00:17:04] match them with others I don't know I
[00:17:06] personally learned Photoshop around 14
[00:17:08] years ago when I was 16 I remember
[00:17:10] taking a linda.com course and then also
[00:17:12] infecting other classmates with my
[00:17:14] enthusiasm for the learning I believe
[00:17:16] three other guys in my class took the
[00:17:18] same course and then all of us were
[00:17:20] photoshopping things into each other and
[00:17:21] something like this we could have only
[00:17:23] dreamed of back then look at that you
[00:17:24] just generate a tree you cut it out you
[00:17:26] insert it into Scene It Blends it all
[00:17:29] together so this is the announcement
[00:17:30] demo but you have all the AI Tools in
[00:17:32] one you have layering and again this
[00:17:34] canvas interface is brand new in here
[00:17:37] and it all started with this simple
[00:17:38] little mask that then AI turned into
[00:17:41] this with precise control if I was a
[00:17:43] designer I'd be probably learning this
[00:17:45] right now I just have to note that you
[00:17:46] can get started for free but this does
[00:17:48] cost money but what a great interface I
[00:17:50] didn't know of this tool before and I
[00:17:51] wanted to show it to you right here okay
[00:17:53] next up we have a upscaling upgrades to
[00:17:55] Leonardo a you might know them there a
[00:17:57] suite of tools and now they also
[00:17:59] included an upscaler just like many
[00:18:01] other apps and I was curious because
[00:18:03] Leonardo AI is a pretty good deal I
[00:18:04] think at $12 a month you get a suite of
[00:18:06] tools that now also has an upscaler when
[00:18:08] you compare it to some other tools like
[00:18:10] in our case we use magnific I still
[00:18:12] think it's state-ofthe-art but it cost
[00:18:14] around $40 a month and we only use it
[00:18:16] for the upscaling so I was curious if
[00:18:18] Leonardo AI could do the same thing so
[00:18:19] we went ahead and tested a bunch of
[00:18:21] images in this brand new upscale of The
[00:18:22] Have and as you can see here from the
[00:18:24] original image this is the Leonardo
[00:18:25] result and this is the magnific result
[00:18:28] and I have to say right way I just
[00:18:29] prefer magnific if you're fine with good
[00:18:31] results then Leonardo is fine but
[00:18:33] magnific is just better isn't it but
[00:18:34] some of these other tools that have 16x
[00:18:36] upscaling not just 2x are just better
[00:18:38] there's more detail now you could use
[00:18:40] something like leonado to get to the 16x
[00:18:42] resolution but you would need to run it
[00:18:44] and then run it again and run it again
[00:18:46] and as you might know these AI UPS
[00:18:47] scalers introduce new details that's how
[00:18:49] they work they hallucinate up what
[00:18:51] should be in between the pixels with AI
[00:18:53] and that way they can really blow up the
[00:18:54] image to incredibly large proportions
[00:18:56] from something that originally should
[00:18:59] not have all that resolution I mean look
[00:19:00] at these books this is the original
[00:19:01] image going to Leonardo over to magnific
[00:19:04] these are pretty comparable a few more a
[00:19:06] cat in a hats in Leonardo wow look at
[00:19:08] this one this is really good and then
[00:19:09] magnific again slightly more detailed
[00:19:12] but I think you can see the pattern here
[00:19:13] it's pretty good and I think this can be
[00:19:15] said for most upscaler these days every
[00:19:17] single app seems to integrate a simple
[00:19:19] AI upscaler just like Leonardo did here
[00:19:21] and they're really good they add a
[00:19:22] little bit of detail you get a bigger
[00:19:24] resolution but as you can see in this
[00:19:26] image it can backfire sometimes and you
[00:19:28] have to play with the settings on
[00:19:29] something like magnific that will blow
[00:19:30] it up so much actually on this elephant
[00:19:32] example I might prefer Leonardo same
[00:19:34] goes for this portrait what's the
[00:19:36] conclusion here AI ups scalers are
[00:19:39] amazing if you or your marketing
[00:19:41] department are not using them in your
[00:19:42] workflows you definitely should be this
[00:19:44] is not just image sharpening that we had
[00:19:46] for decades now this invents new pixels
[00:19:48] and it can be really useful especially
[00:19:49] if you pair it with other eii
[00:19:51] Generations that often have the
[00:19:52] downsides of being a smaller resolution
[00:19:54] in AI video lands there's a super quick
[00:19:56] update for you cling one of the top
[00:19:58] video generators has a brand new model
[00:20:01] cling 1.5 it outputs at 1080p HD and
[00:20:05] there's a few changes but honestly all
[00:20:07] of these video updates lately feel
[00:20:09] marginal there's an entire page that
[00:20:10] I'll leave below where they really
[00:20:12] nicely Illustrated all the changes here
[00:20:14] as you can see it performs way better on
[00:20:16] this good old Will Smith eating noodles
[00:20:19] type of test so that's great but you
[00:20:21] don't get the motion brush and camera
[00:20:22] control in this new model ah by the way
[00:20:25] that's also a new thing they now added
[00:20:26] the motion brush making this the first
[00:20:28] one of the top three video generators to
[00:20:30] actually add selective animation with
[00:20:32] the motion brush this has been one of
[00:20:34] the best features of the original Runway
[00:20:35] if you want to learn more about these
[00:20:37] they put together this guide with a lot
[00:20:39] of detail I'll also link this below this
[00:20:41] thing is freely available includes a
[00:20:42] bunch of prompts and examples and it's
[00:20:44] all in English any AI video enthusiasts
[00:20:47] you'll love this this should be really
[00:20:48] helpful and they even have cats with
[00:20:50] Hats so I don't know what's going on
[00:20:51] over in China but they're getting
[00:20:53] something right so I'm not sure I put
[00:20:54] this together and if they watch the a
[00:20:55] Advantage but if they do hello cling
[00:20:57] guide Rider nice to meet you and that's
[00:20:59] pretty much everything we got for today
[00:21:01] check out the AI Advantage newsletter in
[00:21:02] the description below to get a free
[00:21:04] template with a bunch of beginner
[00:21:05] prompts now also including voice prompts
[00:21:07] and as per usual I'll see you in the
[00:21:09] next episode of AI newsic can use next
[00:21:11] Friday
