Description: US Election: Trump-Harris Debate - The Big Highlights | Vantage with Palki Sharma

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced off in a 90-minute Presidential Debate ahead of the upcoming November election. This was their first direct encounter. Harris criticised Trump over the size of his rally crowds, alleging that his supporters "leave early due to exhaustion and boredom". Trump, in turn, attacked Harris on immigration and inflation, two areas seen as political vulnerabilities for the Democratic candidate. Moderators fact-checked Trump after he made a false claim about immigrants "eating pets" in Springfield, Ohio. Palki Sharma provides a full recap.
