[00:00:04] [Music]
[00:00:10] what's up guys and welcome to my top
[00:00:13] 50 horror films if you guys have not
[00:00:15] already been catching up i've already
[00:00:17] done my top 50 comedies
[00:00:18] and my top 50 action films and this will
[00:00:21] be the last top 50 list
[00:00:23] before i eventually release here in a
[00:00:24] couple weeks my top 100 movies
[00:00:26] of all times end of the year list didn't
[00:00:29] seem like they were really
[00:00:30] worth anything this year uh not too many
[00:00:32] movies to talk about so i just wanted to
[00:00:33] do something a little bit more epic a
[00:00:35] little bit more crazy
[00:00:36] and i've been having a lot of fun and
[00:00:37] working my ass off along the way getting
[00:00:39] these out so hopefully you guys have
[00:00:40] enjoyed them
[00:00:41] but i'm not the only crazy bastard doing
[00:00:43] this brian lomax from brian lomax movie
[00:00:46] talk is also going to be dropping off
[00:00:48] his top 50 horror films either just
[00:00:50] before this list or at the same exact
[00:00:52] time
[00:00:52] and he also did the other two lists with
[00:00:54] me as well so if you're not already a
[00:00:56] subscriber to his awesome channel
[00:00:58] head over the link will be down in the
[00:00:59] video description check out his list
[00:01:01] i'm sure they're going to be very
[00:01:02] different the comedy list especially was
[00:01:04] night and day for mine so get two
[00:01:06] different perspectives
[00:01:07] have fun watching both of our lists and
[00:01:09] see where our love for horror films
[00:01:12] fall on these top 50 horror film lists
[00:01:15] now it should go without saying but it
[00:01:16] never does go without saying because i
[00:01:18] always have to [ __ ] say it but this
[00:01:20] is my top 50 horror films these are my
[00:01:23] personal preferences these are my
[00:01:25] favorites these are movies that i either
[00:01:27] think are the best out there
[00:01:29] or have had the most impact on me or
[00:01:31] something that is just very special to
[00:01:33] me for personal reasons
[00:01:34] this list should not match up with your
[00:01:37] list if there's movies on here that you
[00:01:38] don't like
[00:01:39] or if there's movies that you love that
[00:01:40] aren't on this list that's how it is
[00:01:43] that's the subjectivity of film so
[00:01:44] please just enjoy my list for what it is
[00:01:47] don't be an [ __ ] in the comment
[00:01:49] section tell me about why i'm wrong or
[00:01:51] what should be here or what's missing
[00:01:53] nothing's missing this is my list tell
[00:01:55] me your list
[00:01:56] down below in the comments also one last
[00:01:58] thing before we get started there is
[00:02:00] quite a few of these movies the vast
[00:02:01] majority of the list honestly that i've
[00:02:03] done full reviews for i've talked about
[00:02:05] in rankings so i'm not going to go into
[00:02:07] full discussion
[00:02:08] on quite a few of these movies i'm just
[00:02:09] going to kind of hit the highlights or
[00:02:11] maybe talk about movies that i either
[00:02:13] have a personal story to share
[00:02:14] or a movie that i have not talked about
[00:02:16] in this channel yet so you're going to
[00:02:17] see a lot of montage and until i get to
[00:02:19] the top 15 just like the last two lists
[00:02:21] so
[00:02:21] just be aware not going to talk about
[00:02:23] all 50 it's not going to be a five hour
[00:02:24] video so kicking it off with
[00:02:26] number 50 this is a movie that for a lot
[00:02:29] of people would not be anywhere near
[00:02:31] their top 50 list and i totally
[00:02:33] understand why but this is one of those
[00:02:34] movies that just has a personal
[00:02:36] impact on me and that is the 1990
[00:02:40] version of
[00:02:41] it this is a movie that definitely has
[00:02:44] not aged well in certain aspects and the
[00:02:46] first half
[00:02:47] is much better than the second half but
[00:02:49] it still remains one of my favorite
[00:02:51] horror films of all time to go back and
[00:02:53] re-watch
[00:02:54] because of the impact it had on me as a
[00:02:55] kid there are only
[00:02:57] two horror characters in history that
[00:02:59] have ever
[00:03:00] scared me enough to follow me into my
[00:03:02] nightmares and one of them is tim
[00:03:04] curry's version of pennywise
[00:03:06] it's one where like as a horror fan as a
[00:03:09] kid and you will find out later on this
[00:03:10] list i watched horror from a very young
[00:03:12] age
[00:03:13] and was never really scared by it i
[00:03:15] always just thought it was cool it was
[00:03:16] entertaining it was wild there was never
[00:03:18] horror films that scared me or that i
[00:03:20] couldn't handle or that
[00:03:21] you know would [ __ ] me up for a week
[00:03:23] this was the first
[00:03:24] one and that's always made it have like
[00:03:28] a special place in my heart and i do
[00:03:29] think that the movie is a lot better
[00:03:31] than people give it credit for at least
[00:03:32] for me personally i really love the
[00:03:33] first half i think the first half
[00:03:35] is a damn good story with these kids i
[00:03:37] actually prefer a lot of the
[00:03:39] performances for these kids to the ones
[00:03:41] in the
[00:03:42] most recent remake of the first half of
[00:03:44] it
[00:03:45] and i do think that tim curry's
[00:03:46] pennywise while i understand it has not
[00:03:49] aged well and people that watch it for
[00:03:50] the first time nowadays will not
[00:03:52] understand what the hell i'm smoking
[00:03:54] when i say this i do think that his
[00:03:56] version of pennywise is a little bit
[00:03:57] more effective and is a little bit
[00:03:58] scarier
[00:03:59] than bill skarsgard so it's just one of
[00:04:01] those movies that i totally get why a
[00:04:03] lot of people don't like it i totally
[00:04:05] get why a lot of people have fallen out
[00:04:06] of love with it
[00:04:07] but i haven't it's still one of my
[00:04:09] favorite horror films of all time
[00:04:20] [Music]
[00:04:26] doctor
[00:04:30] [Music]
[00:04:40] oh
[00:04:49] [Music]
[00:04:55] what a nice note they watch prom night
[00:04:58] and save time
[00:04:59] there's a formula to it a very simple
[00:05:02] formula
[00:05:02] everybody's a suspect
[00:05:13] [Applause]
[00:05:20] [Music]
[00:05:22] uh
[00:05:36] cool
[00:05:37] [Music]
[00:05:43] number 41 is sleep away camp now on
[00:05:46] paper i should hate this movie because
[00:05:48] as much as i love
[00:05:49] 80s horror and as much as i love classic
[00:05:51] slashers
[00:05:52] there is a lot of them that i have
[00:05:55] watched for the first time
[00:05:56] basically in the past four years since
[00:05:58] i've been on youtube join the horror
[00:06:00] community and have
[00:06:00] everybody tell me you need to watch this
[00:06:03] there is a lot of them
[00:06:04] that don't age very well and when you
[00:06:06] watch them for the first time in 2019
[00:06:08] 2020 2021 my god are they rough to get
[00:06:12] through you can appreciate some of it
[00:06:13] but
[00:06:14] there's quite a few of them that's like
[00:06:15] oh man i should have grown up watching
[00:06:17] this because that
[00:06:18] that train has passed i've missed my
[00:06:21] stop
[00:06:22] sleep away camp oddly enough is one of
[00:06:23] those movies that still worked for me i
[00:06:26] watched it for the first time
[00:06:28] maybe 10 years ago i had heard some
[00:06:30] rumblings about the ending i think i was
[00:06:32] just bored
[00:06:33] looking online for some classic horror
[00:06:35] films that i had not seen yet
[00:06:36] and i think it was eli roth who was
[00:06:38] talking about sleep boy camp and raving
[00:06:39] about it talking about him and his
[00:06:41] friends rented it and we're just blown
[00:06:42] away by the ending
[00:06:43] so i checked it out i watched the
[00:06:46] trailer and i was like oh my god this is
[00:06:47] going to be a cheese fest
[00:06:48] and it absolutely is and most of the
[00:06:51] time those types of slashers do not work
[00:06:52] for me
[00:06:53] but for whatever reason sleep away camp
[00:06:55] finds that weird
[00:06:57] perfect middle between self-aware
[00:07:00] cheesiness
[00:07:01] and accidental cheesiness and the movie
[00:07:03] is just continuously entertaining for me
[00:07:05] personally
[00:07:06] for how ridiculous it is for how over
[00:07:09] the top it is i mean from the ant
[00:07:11] angela come downstairs like it's just
[00:07:14] it's so
[00:07:15] hokey that i should cringe but i laugh
[00:07:18] every single time that i see this crazy
[00:07:20] [ __ ]
[00:07:21] you get the cook who's literally like
[00:07:23] trying to molest children
[00:07:25] on this [ __ ] camp that should be so
[00:07:27] off-putting to where i hate it and i
[00:07:28] walked i'm like
[00:07:30] i can't wait to see this guy get his and
[00:07:32] he does and it's like yes
[00:07:33] that is great there is awesome kills
[00:07:35] there's entertaining characters
[00:07:37] throughout
[00:07:38] there's some really good like camera
[00:07:39] work here and there like there's one
[00:07:41] kill that you kind of just see in the
[00:07:42] shadows that's actually pretty effective
[00:07:44] and then the ending i'm not going to
[00:07:46] talk about the ending because eventually
[00:07:47] i do want to do a review on this movie
[00:07:49] and i want to discuss it there and for
[00:07:50] those of you that have not seen it i
[00:07:52] would like to
[00:07:53] encourage you to watch it but yeah
[00:07:56] holy [ __ ]
[00:08:15] you want to know what happens to an
[00:08:17] eyeball when it gets
[00:08:18] punctured
[00:08:22] you got any idea how much blood jets out
[00:08:24] of a guy's neck
[00:08:26] and his throats
[00:08:29] [Music]
[00:08:30] what do you want
[00:08:37] number 37 is trick or treat now this is
[00:08:40] a movie that
[00:08:41] again much like it i would understand
[00:08:44] a lot of people not having this anywhere
[00:08:45] near their top 50 because
[00:08:47] subjectively yeah objectively actually
[00:08:50] it's not the best movie it's definitely
[00:08:51] cheesy it's definitely dated it was a
[00:08:53] low budget film but
[00:08:55] this is one of those movies that has
[00:08:57] always
[00:08:58] had a huge impact on me from a very
[00:09:00] young age this was one of those vhs
[00:09:02] tapes that my dad had that he just threw
[00:09:04] in one day and i instantly fell in love
[00:09:06] with it i
[00:09:06] instantly fell in love with the concept
[00:09:08] about this heavy metal kid who's kind of
[00:09:10] ostracized at school and he's uh you
[00:09:13] know
[00:09:13] pushed away and nobody wants to talk to
[00:09:15] him because he's a heavy metal guy which
[00:09:17] i could kind of relate to as a kid not
[00:09:18] quite as extreme as this movie but
[00:09:20] you know thus those of us rockers
[00:09:22] understand that lifestyle
[00:09:24] his favorite rock icon dies tragically
[00:09:26] in a hotel fire he goes nuts and then
[00:09:28] finally discovers that he can
[00:09:30] talk to this guy from beyond the grave
[00:09:32] by playing his records backwards and
[00:09:34] it's just such a cool concept for a
[00:09:36] horror film that
[00:09:37] i actually think is done pretty damn
[00:09:39] well here if you're not a heavy metal
[00:09:40] fan a lot of it's going to go right over
[00:09:42] your head but if you are
[00:09:43] it is so enjoyable but the biggest thing
[00:09:45] honestly that has always stuck with me
[00:09:47] about this movie
[00:09:48] is not even the movie itself it's the
[00:09:50] soundtrack
[00:09:57] i still listen to this soundtrack at
[00:10:00] least every couple months i bought the
[00:10:02] remastered cd just last year
[00:10:04] and was jamming that [ __ ] all summer
[00:10:06] long it's just a phenomenal
[00:10:08] album all together the 80s metal band
[00:10:11] fast way just recorded
[00:10:12] an entire album of songs that they used
[00:10:14] for this movie
[00:10:16] it's awesome it is by far my favorite
[00:10:19] movie soundtrack and
[00:10:20] if you're a rock fan if you love 80s
[00:10:22] metal definitely check that out as well
[00:10:24] but
[00:10:25] this movie is worth your attention if
[00:10:26] you enjoy that lifestyle
[00:10:36] [Music]
[00:10:44] shhh
[00:10:47] [Music]
[00:10:58] please
[00:11:01] he sees you were not content with the
[00:11:14] stories
[00:11:15] so i was obliged
[00:11:31] be my victory
[00:11:42] [Music]
[00:11:52] all right time to bite the bullet
[00:11:56] number 30 is john carpenter's halloween
[00:12:00] so all right i should not have to defend
[00:12:03] a [ __ ] movie that is on my top 50 of
[00:12:05] all time it's on my top 50 of all time
[00:12:07] i'm telling you it's awesome but there
[00:12:09] is a select group of [ __ ] that are
[00:12:11] gonna think because it's not number one
[00:12:13] or number two or better than number one
[00:12:15] that somehow i'm [ __ ] on this movie
[00:12:17] so i'm gonna take a few minutes to talk
[00:12:18] about why
[00:12:19] john carpenter's halloween is in my top
[00:12:21] 50 and not in my top five
[00:12:23] john carpenter's halloween is a movie
[00:12:25] that i grew up loving this was honestly
[00:12:27] the only halloween movie that i grew up
[00:12:29] with i didn't have
[00:12:30] again i've told this story before but a
[00:12:32] lot of my accessibility to horror really
[00:12:34] just depended on what
[00:12:35] my dad had at the house he had a lot of
[00:12:38] the nightmare on elm street movies
[00:12:39] he had a lot of the child's play movies
[00:12:41] oddly enough those are the ones that i
[00:12:43] grew up with loving the most because i
[00:12:44] had the most
[00:12:45] access to them john carpenter's
[00:12:47] halloween was the only halloween movie
[00:12:48] that we ever owned until h2o came out
[00:12:50] and i did not see a lot of the sequels
[00:12:52] until very later on in life and i've
[00:12:56] grown to love
[00:12:57] quite a few of those movies oddly enough
[00:13:00] for as many people like to give me [ __ ]
[00:13:01] saying i hate the halloween series i've
[00:13:03] given positive reviews to all of what
[00:13:05] like three movies
[00:13:06] john carpenter's halloween is an
[00:13:07] absolute masterful
[00:13:10] spotlight movie in the history of horror
[00:13:13] it is a phenomenal slasher movie
[00:13:15] it is a phenomenal start to a franchise
[00:13:18] that
[00:13:19] definitely doesn't maintain the quality
[00:13:22] of the original film but does give us
[00:13:24] one of the most
[00:13:25] if not the most popular slasher
[00:13:27] franchise out there so
[00:13:28] the legacy speaks for itself but what
[00:13:31] this movie excels at
[00:13:33] is being very simplistic and
[00:13:35] minimalistic but being
[00:13:36] so effective with what it gives you just
[00:13:38] this little bit of a boogeyman story
[00:13:41] regarding michael myers as a character
[00:13:43] all
[00:13:44] told through the great character of dr
[00:13:46] loomis and he's kind of like your
[00:13:47] exposition dump throughout the movie
[00:13:48] just
[00:13:49] him his little speeches his lines some
[00:13:52] of those iconic lines about the blackest
[00:13:54] eyes
[00:13:54] that's what fleshes out your monster of
[00:13:57] the movie and it's
[00:13:58] so damn effective it's not the greatest
[00:14:01] movie in the world as far as kills go
[00:14:03] it certainly is minimalistic with that
[00:14:04] and the franchise and slasher films and
[00:14:07] in general have gone way beyond what
[00:14:09] halloween gives you
[00:14:10] but even when you do get a simplistic
[00:14:12] kill like
[00:14:13] the bob kill where he just stabs him
[00:14:15] against the cupboard it's so iconic
[00:14:17] because of how simplistic and how much
[00:14:19] it just kind of bounces off what the
[00:14:21] character of michael myers is that
[00:14:23] childlike curiosity as he's bending his
[00:14:25] head
[00:14:26] this is an awesome movie before a couple
[00:14:29] of years ago
[00:14:30] this probably would have been much
[00:14:31] higher on this list but unfortunately i
[00:14:33] do
[00:14:34] find that even though i think this is
[00:14:36] one of the greatest horror films and one
[00:14:37] of the greatest movies ever made
[00:14:39] it is now one of the most overrated
[00:14:41] movies ever take a big step back
[00:14:44] and literally [ __ ] your own face because
[00:14:47] the franchise
[00:14:49] and its fanatics beat this [ __ ] movie
[00:14:52] into the ground
[00:14:54] constantly go [ __ ] yourself and
[00:14:57] this is not the same experience for
[00:14:58] everybody this is just for me ever since
[00:15:00] halloween 2018
[00:15:02] i have been exposed to the negative side
[00:15:04] of this france or this
[00:15:05] fan base much more than i've been
[00:15:07] exposed to the positive side of this fan
[00:15:09] base and i was a part of a facebook
[00:15:11] group for a number of years that this
[00:15:12] was the only movie and franchise that
[00:15:14] anybody ever wanted to talk to about
[00:15:19] and it just got so mind-numbingly
[00:15:21] aggravating that i've kind of lost a
[00:15:23] little bit of love for this movie
[00:15:25] eventually i'm sure i will get it back
[00:15:27] as long as people chill the [ __ ] out and
[00:15:28] leave me alone and quit antagonizing me
[00:15:31] for not putting halloween
[00:15:32] kills in my top 10 most anticipated
[00:15:34] because apparently it's supposed to be
[00:15:36] defaulted there
[00:15:37] nonetheless this is an awesome movie
[00:15:41] it's an iconic movie and it is at number
[00:15:44] 30
[00:15:44] in my top 50 of all time and right above
[00:15:48] that a movie that i definitely want to
[00:15:50] talk about because of how
[00:15:51] important it is for me as a horror fan
[00:15:54] and that is child's play three now just
[00:15:57] like a couple of the other movies that
[00:15:59] i've talked about
[00:16:00] i completely understand that there is
[00:16:02] the vast majority of the horror fan base
[00:16:05] that is going to think i'm smoking crack
[00:16:06] for putting this movie in my top
[00:16:08] 50 because it wouldn't be anywhere near
[00:16:09] their top totally understand that
[00:16:12] i personally think child's play 3 is a
[00:16:13] lot better than people give it credit
[00:16:15] for i just think child's play 2 got
[00:16:16] there first and people kind of hold that
[00:16:18] against this movie
[00:16:19] but that's just my opinion and that's
[00:16:21] how opinions roll
[00:16:22] but child's play 3 is the movie that
[00:16:25] introduced me to horror
[00:16:26] i still remember walking into my
[00:16:28] apartment when i was like three maybe
[00:16:30] four years old my dad had child's play
[00:16:32] three
[00:16:33] just starting on the tv and i remember
[00:16:35] the plastic little molten
[00:16:36] tornado and then child's play 3 coming
[00:16:39] up and i sat down and watched the whole
[00:16:40] movie
[00:16:41] and instantly became infatuated with
[00:16:44] what the hell i just saw
[00:16:46] and then went on to find freddy a couple
[00:16:48] of days after that went on to find the
[00:16:49] other child's play movies and i just
[00:16:51] became a child's play
[00:16:53] in nightmare on elm street fanatic at a
[00:16:55] very young age
[00:16:56] and that has spawned the love for horror
[00:16:59] that i have to this day and the reason
[00:17:01] why
[00:17:01] i have basically not only done this
[00:17:04] youtube channel but quickly morphed it
[00:17:06] into a very horror focused channel
[00:17:08] because i just love
[00:17:09] horror so much and i love the fan bases
[00:17:11] i love the community
[00:17:13] and it's all because of child's play 3.
[00:17:15] so while
[00:17:16] on paper it might not be top 50 worthy
[00:17:20] for most people out there for me
[00:17:22] it is still one of my favorite and one
[00:17:24] of the most important movies ever
[00:17:26] for me personally because of the impact
[00:17:28] that it has had on me
[00:17:29] talking specifically about the movie
[00:17:31] though this movie is [ __ ] awesome i
[00:17:32] don't care what anybody says i
[00:17:34] understand some of the criticisms but to
[00:17:35] me i think this movie gets
[00:17:36] way too much hate because it still has
[00:17:39] all of the things that we love about
[00:17:41] child's play too it has
[00:17:42] chucky ramped up to 11 all of the
[00:17:44] one-liners this movie has
[00:17:46] the best chucky one-liners in fact i
[00:17:48] will go out on the limb and say that
[00:17:49] the kills are great in it and some of
[00:17:52] them are actually pretty hilarious where
[00:17:53] he kills the guy and doesn't even touch
[00:17:54] him because he has a heart attack
[00:17:56] i actually really enjoy the older andy
[00:17:59] kind of going up against him with the
[00:18:00] recasting i don't mind the recasting
[00:18:02] whatsoever yes
[00:18:03] whenever he's chasing the younger kid
[00:18:05] tyler tyler's not the best actor in the
[00:18:07] world but for [ __ ] sake it's a slasher
[00:18:09] movie there's not the perfect acting in
[00:18:10] the first two movies either
[00:18:12] and the third act of this movie is the
[00:18:14] best third act in the entire franchise
[00:18:16] so i think child's play 3 is actually a
[00:18:18] damn good child's play sequel and it
[00:18:20] constantly baffles me why this is
[00:18:22] usually at the bottom of most people's
[00:18:23] list because for me
[00:18:24] it is way up there
[00:18:32] who is this
[00:18:45] [Music]
[00:18:54] oh
[00:18:57] such a waste
[00:19:19] [Applause]
[00:19:23] look at me jamie it's all for you
[00:19:41] [Music]
[00:19:48] 22 is a very underrated movie for me and
[00:19:51] that is stir of
[00:19:52] echoes to me this is one of if not my
[00:19:56] favorite supernatural horror movie as
[00:19:58] far as like ghost movies go
[00:20:00] this was one that kind of came out
[00:20:01] quietly back when i was a teenager
[00:20:03] you got kevin bacon moves into this new
[00:20:05] neighborhood the suburbs and i believe
[00:20:07] chicago with his wife and his kid
[00:20:09] his kid from the very beginning of the
[00:20:10] movie shows a little bit of clairvoyance
[00:20:12] like he can speak to something there
[00:20:14] some kind of presence
[00:20:15] is communicating with him and after this
[00:20:18] hypnotism thing gone wrong at
[00:20:20] a party kevin bacon suddenly has that
[00:20:22] same clairvoyance
[00:20:24] and can talk to spirits and namely a
[00:20:27] spirit that is in his house constantly
[00:20:29] the movie really does put you on edge
[00:20:32] it's one of the most effective and
[00:20:33] genuinely creepy supernatural
[00:20:35] horror films i've ever seen and it
[00:20:38] really takes you on a great mystery
[00:20:39] where you're going along with kevin
[00:20:40] bacon who
[00:20:41] acts phenomenally in this movie by the
[00:20:43] way as he's starting to discover
[00:20:46] why this girl in his house is trying to
[00:20:48] communicate with him and then he starts
[00:20:50] to do whatever she wants him to do as
[00:20:51] far as
[00:20:52] uncover why she is still in this house
[00:20:55] and try to solve her murder basically
[00:20:57] it's an awesome movie honest i don't
[00:20:58] want to tell you too much about it
[00:21:00] because this is a movie that i feel like
[00:21:01] not a whole lot of people have seen
[00:21:02] because not a whole lot of people ever
[00:21:03] talk about it but
[00:21:04] for me it is always a go-to and then
[00:21:06] number 21 is gonna be
[00:21:08] the faculty now robert rodriguez is a
[00:21:11] director that i have kind of a funny
[00:21:12] relationship with because he's one of
[00:21:14] the most iconic directors out there but
[00:21:16] i don't tend to love a lot of his movies
[00:21:18] the faculty is one of those exceptions
[00:21:21] this came out right at the perfect age
[00:21:22] for me where i was a pre-teen
[00:21:24] i was probably a little bit more mature
[00:21:27] for my age so i
[00:21:28] mentally i was more in line with the
[00:21:30] high schoolers of this movie while i was
[00:21:32] still only like
[00:21:33] 9 or 10 years old but i watched the
[00:21:35] faculty and
[00:21:36] instantly just fell in love with it just
[00:21:38] kind of this modern really cool hip
[00:21:40] twist
[00:21:40] on invasion of the body snatchers where
[00:21:42] you get this high school
[00:21:44] rowdy ass high school by the way in the
[00:21:46] middle of ohio
[00:21:47] where an alien drops and basically
[00:21:49] starts taking people over and now people
[00:21:51] are becoming pods
[00:21:52] namely the faculty and then these group
[00:21:55] of kids that realize what's going on
[00:21:57] has to battle this situation it's just
[00:21:59] an absolute blast of a movie it's
[00:22:01] stylistic as hell
[00:22:03] it is [ __ ] entertaining from
[00:22:05] beginning to
[00:22:06] the end you get people like elijah wood
[00:22:08] just randomly in here at least for me
[00:22:10] personally i hadn't seen him in a long
[00:22:11] time
[00:22:12] and this is one of those weird movies
[00:22:13] that elijah wood chose between like the
[00:22:15] lord of the rings fame and back when he
[00:22:17] was a child actor
[00:22:18] and he works so well in the role that
[00:22:20] you give him josh hartnett was still
[00:22:22] pretty early in his career and i really
[00:22:23] liked seeing him at the time i was like
[00:22:25] hey it's that h2o guy i like him
[00:22:27] the whole cast really is just great in
[00:22:28] this even the faculty you get robert
[00:22:30] patrick back
[00:22:31] from t2 and he's one of the main
[00:22:32] villains it's this is just an
[00:22:34] endlessly rewatchable movie for me that
[00:22:36] i think is so much fun
[00:22:38] it has so much style and does such a
[00:22:40] cool modern twist
[00:22:42] on a classic alien story that it still
[00:22:45] holds up to me this does not feel dated
[00:22:47] like it's just this 90s thing
[00:22:48] you could release this movie today and i
[00:22:50] still think that it would have the same
[00:22:52] amount of
[00:22:52] stylistic impact
[00:23:19] [Music]
[00:23:24] hey you ain't mad are you
[00:23:45] [Applause]
[00:23:48] oh
[00:23:50] [Applause]
[00:23:52] [Music]
[00:24:00] [Applause]
[00:24:01] [Music]
[00:24:02] wow
[00:24:09] all right guys we're here top 15 and
[00:24:11] number 15 is a movie that you have heard
[00:24:13] me talk about numerous times on this
[00:24:14] channel and that is
[00:24:16] frailty this was actually directed by
[00:24:17] the late great bill paxton
[00:24:19] and it remains one of my favorite horror
[00:24:21] films of all time not only because it is
[00:24:22] so great but it's also like stir of echo
[00:24:24] as one of them
[00:24:25] those movies that i feel like doesn't
[00:24:27] get the credit that it really deserves
[00:24:28] because this is just a phenomenal film
[00:24:30] you get this father who comes home to
[00:24:32] his sons one day and says that he got a
[00:24:34] message from god
[00:24:36] that they are supposed to destroy demons
[00:24:38] that are surrounding them
[00:24:40] and to him it sounds like this biblical
[00:24:43] journey this mission that they are on
[00:24:44] and the younger son who's a little bit
[00:24:46] more
[00:24:46] trusting of his father is along for it
[00:24:48] but the middle son
[00:24:50] just sees that as his father coming home
[00:24:52] losing his mind one day and forcing them
[00:24:54] to be complicit in him
[00:24:55] murdering people and this is a movie
[00:24:57] that just takes you on such a wild ride
[00:25:00] from matthew mcconaughey being the older
[00:25:02] version of the the younger kid telling
[00:25:04] you this story to a detective
[00:25:06] and it's all told through flashbacks to
[00:25:08] the relationship with
[00:25:09] from bill paxton to both of his sons
[00:25:11] which the acting all around is awesome
[00:25:13] in this
[00:25:14] to you as a viewer trying to figure out
[00:25:16] along with the narrator of the story
[00:25:19] whether or not something sinister is
[00:25:21] going on and this father is on a mission
[00:25:22] from god
[00:25:23] or his dad has genuinely lost his mind
[00:25:25] and murdering people and you're rooting
[00:25:27] for the older child to get out of this
[00:25:28] horrific situation and this is one of
[00:25:30] those few movies too that has
[00:25:32] multiple twists in the third act and
[00:25:35] all of them hit and make the last twist
[00:25:38] even better than it already was
[00:25:40] very few movies can do that most movies
[00:25:42] that have two or three twists
[00:25:43] one or two of them might be great but
[00:25:45] one of them always stumbles a little bit
[00:25:47] and goes a little bit too far this movie
[00:25:48] just does it masterfully so i'm not
[00:25:50] going to tell you anything else about
[00:25:51] this
[00:25:52] this is another movie that eventually i
[00:25:53] would like to do a standalone review for
[00:25:55] but i've talked about it ad nauseam so
[00:25:57] if by now i have not sold you on frailty
[00:26:00] god damn it watch this movie number 14
[00:26:03] maybe a little controversial but [ __ ] it
[00:26:05] jeepers creepers is still one of my
[00:26:07] favorite horror films and by far one of
[00:26:09] my favorite monster movies i know
[00:26:11] everything about the director all the
[00:26:12] controversy
[00:26:13] not talking about any of that i
[00:26:15] understand why some people don't even
[00:26:17] acknowledge this movie anymore because
[00:26:18] of that but for me personally
[00:26:20] i can separate the art from the artist
[00:26:22] for some cases
[00:26:24] and i've grown up loving this movie way
[00:26:27] before i even knew anything about all of
[00:26:28] that so
[00:26:29] it's impossible for me to discard it i
[00:26:31] love jeepers creepers so much this was a
[00:26:34] movie that
[00:26:34] came out of absolutely nowhere for me i
[00:26:37] remember it was halloween i believe it
[00:26:38] was 2001 so it was right after 9 11
[00:26:42] and you know there was all these scares
[00:26:44] about halloween candy and
[00:26:46] anthrax and all that [ __ ] so we actually
[00:26:48] did not go trick-or-treating that year
[00:26:49] and we just went and rented two movies
[00:26:51] and the woman that my dad was dating at
[00:26:53] the time
[00:26:54] her daughter picked [ __ ] doctor
[00:26:55] doolittle 2 with eddie murphy
[00:26:57] and i picked jeepers creepers because
[00:26:59] i'm like [ __ ] we're watching a goddamn
[00:27:00] horror movie
[00:27:01] on goddamn halloween i'm not watching
[00:27:03] this [ __ ] family
[00:27:04] animal [ __ ] so we got deeper
[00:27:06] creepers had no idea what the movie was
[00:27:08] about had no idea about anything i just
[00:27:10] thought it had a cool title and it was
[00:27:11] horror on halloween so we're watching it
[00:27:14] put it in and this movie just took me on
[00:27:16] a wild ride from start to finish and i
[00:27:19] did not have any idea what was around
[00:27:20] any corner and it's one of the most
[00:27:22] masterfully written monster movies
[00:27:24] because it doesn't really even reveal
[00:27:26] that it's a monster movie until at the
[00:27:28] end of the second act
[00:27:30] it starts off as just like this thriller
[00:27:32] with this truck coming up
[00:27:35] out of nowhere and you're like holy [ __ ]
[00:27:36] that's effective
[00:27:38] the seeing the guy dumped the bodies and
[00:27:40] now he's chasing after them they have to
[00:27:42] go back and they see the
[00:27:43] bodies all over the wall it's just a
[00:27:45] movie that slowly peels back this
[00:27:46] demented ass
[00:27:48] onion and you have no idea where the
[00:27:50] hell you're going to be by the time you
[00:27:51] get to the center
[00:27:53] and when it finally reveals that this
[00:27:54] thing is like this archaic monster
[00:27:56] it's just an awesome film so
[00:27:59] not a whole lot of people need to be
[00:28:00] sold on cheaper creepers most people
[00:28:02] know how awesome it is
[00:28:03] or just don't want to talk about it
[00:28:04] anymore but still
[00:28:07] one of my favorite films of all time
[00:28:08] number 13
[00:28:10] boy fantasm
[00:28:14] this is another film that i grew up
[00:28:16] watching from a very young age my dad
[00:28:17] was a phantasm fanatic we had
[00:28:19] the first two on vhs and that was
[00:28:22] quickly added to my rotation of chucky
[00:28:24] and freddy
[00:28:25] after i watched the first one or
[00:28:27] actually i believe i watched the second
[00:28:28] one first so the second one was the one
[00:28:29] that sold me on it but
[00:28:30] the first film while it's definitely a
[00:28:33] divisive movie some people don't get it
[00:28:35] don't get into it i have always latched
[00:28:37] into this as a very cool effective and
[00:28:39] ominous
[00:28:40] sci-fi horror film where you have this
[00:28:43] mortuary where this very
[00:28:46] eerie cryptic tall guy something
[00:28:48] sinister is going on and these two
[00:28:50] brothers are on a mission to figure out
[00:28:52] what is going on and what exactly
[00:28:54] is happening at this morningside mercury
[00:28:57] you get their buddy reggie the ice cream
[00:28:58] vendor into it at some point
[00:29:00] and you realize that there is some kind
[00:29:01] of an alien sci-fi thing going on where
[00:29:04] this tall man is taking dead bodies and
[00:29:07] re-animating them to be his slaves for
[00:29:09] of the undead and it's a really
[00:29:12] effective movie because
[00:29:13] it's low budget and they do so much with
[00:29:15] that low budget with don coscarelli and
[00:29:17] what he's able to do with his directing
[00:29:18] but
[00:29:19] there's just so much iconic about this
[00:29:21] film from the little
[00:29:22] evil jawas is what i'll call them and
[00:29:24] the noise that they make to the spheres
[00:29:26] that's kind of like the symbol of the
[00:29:27] franchises those little spheres the
[00:29:29] brain suckers and
[00:29:30] drilling the guys head out and shooting
[00:29:32] blood everywhere even the tall man
[00:29:34] himself man
[00:29:34] angus scrim is just one of the most
[00:29:36] underappreciated horror icons to me
[00:29:38] that guy is still so creepy and you look
[00:29:41] at interviews of him he's such a nice
[00:29:43] sweet guy rest in peace but when he
[00:29:46] turns on the tall man he just you know
[00:29:48] does that thing with his eye
[00:29:49] and the way that he talks boy you come
[00:29:52] to us it's just such
[00:29:53] an iconic effective character i love
[00:29:56] this original movie i understand some
[00:29:58] people
[00:29:58] it's a little bit foggy it doesn't
[00:30:00] really give you enough answers for me
[00:30:02] i've always appreciated the ambiguity of
[00:30:04] it
[00:30:05] would have helped if the fifth film in
[00:30:06] this franchise that answered some of
[00:30:07] those
[00:30:08] questions but we won't talk about that
[00:30:09] one this is supposed to be about good
[00:30:10] movies
[00:30:11] number 12.
[00:30:16] the terminator yes the terminator the
[00:30:20] original film
[00:30:21] is a horror film the terminator is
[00:30:24] a slasher film i will argue that with
[00:30:27] anybody
[00:30:28] if you saw my top 50 action film list
[00:30:30] you were probably wondering why the
[00:30:32] first film which i loved so much was not
[00:30:34] on that list
[00:30:35] because it belongs on a horror list baby
[00:30:36] the first film while having a lot of
[00:30:38] action
[00:30:39] and while certainly having sci-fi in
[00:30:41] there for me has
[00:30:42] always felt dominantly like a horror
[00:30:45] film like a slasher film you have this
[00:30:47] unstoppable killing machine
[00:30:49] that is just blowing through numerous
[00:30:52] people trying to get to its target
[00:30:54] that by definition to me is a slasher
[00:30:56] film if the dude was using knives
[00:30:57] instead of guns we wouldn't even be
[00:30:59] having this conversation but i'm not
[00:31:00] gonna defend this again
[00:31:01] this is my opinion if you don't agree
[00:31:03] whatever pretend i didn't say the
[00:31:04] terminator then
[00:31:05] the terminator is one of the most
[00:31:07] awesome
[00:31:08] introductions to a franchise ever the
[00:31:11] original film is so good at doing what
[00:31:13] it does with such a low budget i mean
[00:31:14] you look at something like t2 that's
[00:31:16] this massive movie
[00:31:17] and you see where it came from with t1
[00:31:19] and how effective it was
[00:31:21] with the lower budget that james cameron
[00:31:23] had and it's just
[00:31:24] mind-blowing and it still ages so well a
[00:31:26] couple of the digital stop-motion
[00:31:28] effects don't age so well
[00:31:29] everything else is like holy [ __ ] i
[00:31:31] don't know if i could make this movie if
[00:31:33] you gave me the same amount of money
[00:31:34] today
[00:31:35] you get an iconic villain in the
[00:31:37] terminator in the t-800 you get a career
[00:31:40] exploding performance by arnold
[00:31:43] schwarzenegger in this role
[00:31:44] and you get two awesome leads in sarah
[00:31:47] connor played by linda hamilton
[00:31:49] my favorite final girl of all time and
[00:31:51] michael bean playing kyle reese
[00:31:54] and this budding love story that's at
[00:31:55] the bed of all of it is just one of the
[00:31:57] most
[00:31:57] awesome love stories of all time where
[00:31:59] you have this soldier
[00:32:01] sent back through time to be the
[00:32:02] protector for the mother of the savior
[00:32:05] and realizes at the end that he's loved
[00:32:08] her the entire time that's why he came
[00:32:10] back and he's actually the father of
[00:32:11] john connor and holy [ __ ] time paradox
[00:32:14] this is an awesome [ __ ] movie i don't
[00:32:15] even know why i'm sitting here trying to
[00:32:17] defend why it's an awesome movie because
[00:32:18] all you know it's an awesome movie and
[00:32:19] it's at the top of your list too
[00:32:21] isn't it number 11 is going to be misery
[00:32:24] this is always been one of my favorite
[00:32:28] stephen king adaptations and it is
[00:32:30] all because of the performance by kathy
[00:32:32] bates there is no question why this lady
[00:32:34] won the oscar the year this movie came
[00:32:36] out
[00:32:37] this is just such an effective horror
[00:32:40] film
[00:32:40] such an effective claustrophobic movie
[00:32:42] about possession and the ugly side of
[00:32:45] fandom
[00:32:46] and it's just unnerving from start to
[00:32:48] finish what starts off
[00:32:50] innocently enough with this famed author
[00:32:52] coming into a
[00:32:53] near-death experience and being nursed
[00:32:54] back to health by this
[00:32:56] quirky but very sweet southern lady that
[00:32:58] happens to like his books
[00:33:00] and then quickly you find out this [ __ ]
[00:33:02] is nuts she is obsessed with this guy in
[00:33:04] his novels
[00:33:05] and she's not letting him go anywhere no
[00:33:07] matter how healthy he gets
[00:33:09] and the way that the movie just
[00:33:11] continuously ramps up
[00:33:13] how psychotic annie wilks is and how
[00:33:16] nuts her fandom is for not only this guy
[00:33:19] but his character misery
[00:33:20] it just disturbs you the entire time and
[00:33:23] everybody knows the hobbling scene when
[00:33:24] it gets to the point where she realizes
[00:33:26] that he's been trying to escape
[00:33:27] and she's got to take that out of the
[00:33:29] [ __ ] equation my god
[00:33:31] very fewer scenes in horror history can
[00:33:33] make you just
[00:33:35] wince when the effect goes misery is
[00:33:38] a masterpiece this is a movie that they
[00:33:40] should never try to remake they should
[00:33:42] never try to retouch or redo because it
[00:33:44] is done
[00:33:45] absolutely perfectly here by rob reiner
[00:33:48] number 10
[00:33:49] well hello clarice the silence of the
[00:33:52] lambs
[00:33:53] and oddly enough this is one of those
[00:33:54] movies that people try to argue is not a
[00:33:56] horror film
[00:33:56] which whatever okay it's easily a horror
[00:34:00] film for me but
[00:34:01] the silence of the lambs there's been
[00:34:04] nothing close to this as far as the
[00:34:06] character of hannibal lecter and he's
[00:34:07] had some pretty good movies in his
[00:34:09] franchise too he's one of my favorite
[00:34:10] horror characters
[00:34:12] this movie does so good at just making
[00:34:15] you feel
[00:34:16] disgusting from the way that it
[00:34:19] details the murders of buffalo bill to
[00:34:22] even the scenes where it shows him
[00:34:24] enacting his ritual if you will where he
[00:34:27] kidnaps somebody and he's wearing
[00:34:28] you know skin and he's tucking his dick
[00:34:31] under and all that weird macabre
[00:34:32] [ __ ] but even just the scenes where
[00:34:35] she's going to visit hannibal lecter in
[00:34:37] this
[00:34:37] nasty ass little prison this psychiatric
[00:34:41] ward and all the people that are around
[00:34:42] hannibal lecter
[00:34:43] it's a movie that just on its surface
[00:34:45] the tone
[00:34:46] and the direction of it just kind of
[00:34:48] makes you feel like you need to take a
[00:34:49] shower
[00:34:50] and it's horrifying for that alone but
[00:34:53] the story
[00:34:54] is just so brilliantly done where you
[00:34:56] have this young fbi agent
[00:34:58] she comes in she's interviewing this
[00:34:59] masterful manipulator and hannibal
[00:35:01] lecter
[00:35:02] played masterfully by anthony hopkins
[00:35:05] and trying to search for
[00:35:06] possibly an even more dangerous killer
[00:35:08] played masterfully masterfully by ted
[00:35:10] levine
[00:35:12] and there's just so much iconic horrific
[00:35:14] [ __ ] that comes out of this movie from
[00:35:16] hannibal lecter's lines
[00:35:17] to buffalo bills lines to just the
[00:35:20] images of him
[00:35:21] with his dick tucked under and doing his
[00:35:24] little dance and [ __ ]
[00:35:25] there is very few movies that are
[00:35:27] detective stories or murder mystery
[00:35:29] stories or
[00:35:30] serial killer stories or even just
[00:35:33] horror films in general that reached the
[00:35:36] level of
[00:35:36] mastery that the silence of the lambs
[00:35:39] was able to reach this is one of those
[00:35:40] few movies in history that
[00:35:42] before like the past couple of years
[00:35:44] we're starting to gain some traction
[00:35:46] with award season in the horror genre
[00:35:48] this is one of those movies in the past
[00:35:49] that did get
[00:35:51] the recognition that it deserved from
[00:35:53] the academy and from all of the critics
[00:35:55] because it absolutely deserved it and it
[00:35:57] rose above the pack
[00:35:58] sticking with the theme of horror films
[00:36:01] that
[00:36:01] people i guess decide aren't horror
[00:36:04] films
[00:36:05] seven seven is a
[00:36:08] mind-blowing experience and it's
[00:36:11] definitely one where your first
[00:36:12] experience is the best and it has the
[00:36:14] most impact on you but it is still an
[00:36:16] endlessly rewatchable movie because of
[00:36:19] how unique it is
[00:36:21] with the end of the second act through
[00:36:23] the third act with your typical
[00:36:24] detective murder mystery story you get
[00:36:26] brad pitt
[00:36:27] who's this up-and-coming detective you
[00:36:30] get morgan freeman who's about to retire
[00:36:32] and is the seasoned respected detective
[00:36:35] who is searching for this killer that is
[00:36:37] murdering people in the most
[00:36:38] disturbing ways using the themes of the
[00:36:41] seven deadly sins hence the title
[00:36:43] and where this movie is effective is not
[00:36:46] just in how effective these murder
[00:36:48] scenes are
[00:36:48] and whenever they're trying to put the
[00:36:50] pieces together on what this killer did
[00:36:52] to certain people some victims of which
[00:36:54] were like
[00:36:55] a year plus of torture before they
[00:36:58] actually were found in this crime scene
[00:37:00] but where the movie really gains its
[00:37:03] legacy is in the third act
[00:37:05] where you get the killer spoiler alert
[00:37:07] by the way if you have not seen seven
[00:37:08] go watch seven then come back when the
[00:37:12] killer comes up puts his hands in the
[00:37:14] air and surrenders
[00:37:15] right when the movie is starting to get
[00:37:16] tense enough where you think they might
[00:37:18] be getting enough clues to catch him and
[00:37:19] he just walks in and says it's me
[00:37:22] and the ride that it takes you from then
[00:37:24] all the way to the opening of that box
[00:37:26] and the climax of the film is just
[00:37:28] something where
[00:37:30] you're never ready for it if somebody
[00:37:32] does not spoil this movie for you
[00:37:34] you are never there's not a single
[00:37:36] person in this world
[00:37:37] who is ready for where this movie takes
[00:37:40] them or has it
[00:37:41] figured out or can predict it there is
[00:37:43] no [ __ ] way this movie pulls the rug
[00:37:45] out from under you
[00:37:46] in one of the most genuinely shocking
[00:37:49] ways that i've ever seen in a film
[00:37:51] and it's still effective for that it's
[00:37:53] still it's legacy is for that because it
[00:37:56] is just so
[00:37:58] off the beaten path for where most
[00:37:59] detective stories end
[00:38:01] and you're like holy [ __ ] i don't i need
[00:38:04] to go take a shower
[00:38:05] and cry in a bubble bath after watching
[00:38:07] what the [ __ ] i just watched number
[00:38:08] eight
[00:38:09] you're so cool brewster fright night one
[00:38:12] of my favorite vampire films
[00:38:14] of all time and i do enjoy the remake
[00:38:16] quite a bit too it's not top 50 material
[00:38:18] but i do enjoy the remake the original
[00:38:20] is this great little
[00:38:21] genre bender of horror and comedy where
[00:38:23] it takes the very
[00:38:24] classic tale of vampires all the classic
[00:38:27] rules
[00:38:28] all the classic like 50s like hammer
[00:38:30] films approach to its main villain
[00:38:33] but brings it into an 80s horror setting
[00:38:35] where these kids are self-aware
[00:38:37] about the horror genre and they're
[00:38:38] self-aware about vampires
[00:38:40] and vampire films and vampire tv series
[00:38:43] and when charlie brewster wakes up
[00:38:45] and realizes that the neighbor that just
[00:38:47] moved in next door
[00:38:49] is actually a vampire and nobody will
[00:38:51] believe him
[00:38:52] and the only person that he can team up
[00:38:54] with to even have a chance at surviving
[00:38:56] this
[00:38:56] is his favorite tv host that is a
[00:39:00] retired basically a washed up vampire
[00:39:02] killer actor
[00:39:04] it's just such a genius concept that it
[00:39:06] works so goddamn well you get all of the
[00:39:09] nostalgia here you get the 80s nostalgia
[00:39:11] and you get the 50s 60s nostalgia
[00:39:13] because of all the rules like
[00:39:15] not being able to come into somebody's
[00:39:16] house unless you're invited and
[00:39:19] i love the classic approach to vampires
[00:39:21] there's so many different movies and
[00:39:22] different interpretations and different
[00:39:24] directions that vampire films go with
[00:39:26] what rules work
[00:39:28] what rules don't work there are little
[00:39:29] modern spins on it and how things
[00:39:31] how things work in this universe fright
[00:39:34] night i've always loved because it just
[00:39:35] takes that very simplistic classic
[00:39:37] approach where
[00:39:38] it could easily be too cheesy to try to
[00:39:41] convince you that a vampire has to be
[00:39:42] invited in but they use it so well
[00:39:45] as this plot divisive okay as long as
[00:39:47] you don't let him in you're safe and
[00:39:48] then he walks downstairs and his mom
[00:39:49] just
[00:39:50] [ __ ] him over it's just so damn
[00:39:53] good you get characters like evil ed
[00:39:55] that is so iconic in this as the kind of
[00:39:57] nerdy friend
[00:39:58] who's seduced by
[00:40:02] jerry dandridge and jerry dandridge
[00:40:03] himself is just such an iconic villain
[00:40:05] in the performance by chris saran that
[00:40:07] is one of my favorite vampire characters
[00:40:09] if not my favorite vampire character of
[00:40:11] all time and even the practical effects
[00:40:12] that they use in this are very cool like
[00:40:14] there's almost like some werewolf stuff
[00:40:16] brought into this like there's a there's
[00:40:18] a mouth that's opened up that's like
[00:40:19] early blade 2.
[00:40:20] there's a vampire that turns into a wolf
[00:40:22] at one point and even just the
[00:40:24] transformation that jerry dandridge has
[00:40:26] from human form to
[00:40:28] bat humanoid form is just very cool
[00:40:31] effective effects that
[00:40:33] to me have still aged pretty damn well i
[00:40:34] mean it has this classic appeal to it
[00:40:36] you can tell it's from the 80s
[00:40:38] but watching it in modern times it's
[00:40:40] almost like that was intended to always
[00:40:42] look that way i mean tom holland man
[00:40:44] that guy is just like an
[00:40:45] unsung hero in horror that does not get
[00:40:48] the
[00:40:48] the credit that he deserves like he
[00:40:50] deserves to be on the
[00:40:52] horror director horror writer mount
[00:40:53] rushmore and very few times do you ever
[00:40:55] hear that guy's name mentioned
[00:40:57] number seven one of my favorite horror
[00:40:59] sequels of all time and that is phantasm
[00:41:01] two now sometimes i will kind of
[00:41:03] fluctuate with phantasm two and one and
[00:41:05] which one that i like more i'll do a
[00:41:07] you know binge of the franchise and come
[00:41:09] out loving one a little bit more because
[00:41:10] of its
[00:41:11] eeriness and the sci-fi side of it and
[00:41:13] then the next year i'll watch it and
[00:41:15] two will be easily my favorite where two
[00:41:17] is so damn good
[00:41:18] is that it holds on to a lot of what you
[00:41:20] love about the first film as far as the
[00:41:22] eeriness
[00:41:23] and the concept itself and all these
[00:41:25] iconic images and iconic characters
[00:41:28] but it just ramps up the tension it
[00:41:30] ramps up the action
[00:41:31] and makes it a more exciting more
[00:41:33] accessible movie this was the one that
[00:41:35] had by far the biggest budget
[00:41:37] and it does show when you binge the
[00:41:38] franchise two is like this huge peak and
[00:41:40] then it goes right back down
[00:41:42] but this is just such a endlessly
[00:41:44] entertaining movie because it has
[00:41:45] everything you want
[00:41:46] in the horror film and in the sci-finess
[00:41:48] of the first film but it just
[00:41:50] it's more entertaining for me it's
[00:41:52] easier to watch it's more rewatchable
[00:41:54] it's
[00:41:55] easier to throw it on and i actually
[00:41:57] prefer
[00:41:58] james lagross in the role of mike i
[00:42:00] might be on an island with that one
[00:42:02] i loved him as a kid in the first movie
[00:42:03] i don't think he does all that well
[00:42:05] in the further sequels so i don't mind
[00:42:07] at all that they changed the cast into
[00:42:09] this older guy
[00:42:10] and i think he has a little bit more
[00:42:12] chemistry with reggie bannister now
[00:42:14] reggie
[00:42:15] that guy right there that is an iconic
[00:42:18] character to me the skullet
[00:42:19] the the [ __ ] quadruple barrel shotgun
[00:42:22] that hemi cuda which to this day is
[00:42:26] still
[00:42:26] the car that i want in my driveway more
[00:42:29] than anything else everybody's got that
[00:42:30] favorite car
[00:42:31] the hemi cuda from the phantasm
[00:42:33] franchise is that car for me like if
[00:42:35] anybody wants to do
[00:42:36] like the most grand gesture in the world
[00:42:39] if i have like a billion dollar fan out
[00:42:41] there somewhere that just wants to send
[00:42:43] me a gift to my p.o box
[00:42:44] send me the key and the location to that
[00:42:46] hemi cuda from this franchise
[00:42:48] yes phantasm 2 if you're a fan
[00:42:51] of the first one this one is impossible
[00:42:54] not to love
[00:42:55] if you were on the fence about the first
[00:42:56] one and maybe didn't get it as much
[00:42:58] i think phantasm 2 is the one movie in
[00:43:01] this franchise that is
[00:43:03] guaranteed to appeal to pretty much any
[00:43:05] horror fan
[00:43:06] number six bringing back my boy wait
[00:43:09] where's he at i need him
[00:43:10] number six is child's play two easily
[00:43:13] one of my favorite sequels one of my
[00:43:14] favorite horror films and my favorite
[00:43:16] child's play movie
[00:43:18] of all time as much as i love three for
[00:43:20] what it did for me as a horror fan as
[00:43:21] much as i enjoy the hell
[00:43:23] out of the zaniness of bride of chucky
[00:43:26] child's play 2
[00:43:27] to me is easily the best that's the one
[00:43:28] that has the most classic appeal
[00:43:30] that's where chucky finally becomes the
[00:43:33] chucky that we know and love and gets
[00:43:34] gets ramped up to 11 and the one-liners
[00:43:36] are going and he's kind of like the star
[00:43:38] of the movie at this point which is how
[00:43:40] it should be in a child's play movie
[00:43:42] i think andy uh and alex vincent is
[00:43:45] acting is much better in the second
[00:43:46] movie and he's great in this one i love
[00:43:48] kyle as a secondary character that comes
[00:43:50] in as kind of this
[00:43:51] older sister subject his foster sister
[00:43:55] i even like the kookiness of the foster
[00:43:57] parents and that kind of it's a weird
[00:43:59] uneasiness that you have even without
[00:44:01] chucky around but the kills are great
[00:44:03] and the third act despite how
[00:44:06] awesome child's play three's third act
[00:44:09] is child's play two does come close
[00:44:11] because that whole toy factory ending
[00:44:13] and
[00:44:13] once it gets to the point where chucky
[00:44:15] finds out that it's too late
[00:44:17] and he's stuck in this body and he's
[00:44:19] just like you [ __ ] i'm gonna get you
[00:44:21] and it just becomes this
[00:44:22] chase all the way to the credits where
[00:44:24] chucky's coming at andy with
[00:44:25] everything that he has it is an awesome
[00:44:29] awesome climax to that film and as much
[00:44:32] as i enjoy some of the further sequels
[00:44:33] in the child's play franchise and
[00:44:35] hopefully we'll enjoy many more
[00:44:39] none of them have come to the level of
[00:44:40] mastery and the level of awesomeness
[00:44:42] that is child's play too number five
[00:44:45] this
[00:44:46] is god a nightmare on [ __ ] elm
[00:44:50] street
[00:44:51] yes you knew it was going to be up here
[00:44:52] at the top somewhere and this
[00:44:54] is just one of the most classic awesome
[00:44:59] any other hyperbole word i can think of
[00:45:01] horror film
[00:45:02] that gave me my favorite horror icon of
[00:45:05] all time and one of my favorite horror
[00:45:07] franchises
[00:45:08] of all time such a genius concept for a
[00:45:11] horror film by wes craven about this
[00:45:13] dream demon that comes to kids for
[00:45:15] revenge
[00:45:16] in their nightmares and nobody can save
[00:45:18] them their parents can't save them their
[00:45:19] friends can't save them
[00:45:20] and they can't even save themselves
[00:45:22] because eventually you're gonna have to
[00:45:24] sleep it's just
[00:45:24] one of the most genius concepts that
[00:45:27] continues to amaze me
[00:45:28] every single time i go back to
[00:45:29] appreciate this first film it's just
[00:45:31] like
[00:45:32] how do you come up with something like
[00:45:33] this how do you do that how do you
[00:45:35] come up with something so perfect for a
[00:45:37] horror film well
[00:45:38] wes craven did it you got robert anglin
[00:45:41] who was basically an unknown actor at
[00:45:42] the time that comes in and gives one of
[00:45:44] the biggest
[00:45:45] iconic performances as freddy krueger
[00:45:47] from the manurisms
[00:45:49] to the voice to just everything he
[00:45:51] birthed
[00:45:52] freddy krueger wes craven gave him the
[00:45:54] seeds and he grew it into this big
[00:45:56] bad ass tree that is one of the most
[00:45:59] awesome iconic
[00:46:00] horror villains of all time and you get
[00:46:02] heather langan camp here and one of my
[00:46:04] favorite final girl roles as well and
[00:46:05] nancy thompson just one of those final
[00:46:07] girls that is not taking any [ __ ]
[00:46:09] and is going to fight back and take the
[00:46:11] fight to freddie
[00:46:12] even the way that the movie is just
[00:46:14] structured where the movie starts off
[00:46:16] innocently enough high school kids
[00:46:18] hanging out they start whispering about
[00:46:19] these dreams that they're having and
[00:46:21] you're starting to set up that lore
[00:46:23] kids start dying off eventually they
[00:46:25] find out through nancy's mom what the
[00:46:27] truth of freddy krueger is which is just
[00:46:29] disturbing as all hell
[00:46:31] all the way to this explosive one-on-one
[00:46:33] match in the third act between nancy and
[00:46:35] freddie
[00:46:36] you even get johnny depp in there this
[00:46:37] movie gave us johnny depp so if you're a
[00:46:39] johnny depp fanatic you got that as a
[00:46:40] bullet point as well
[00:46:42] what else do i need to say this film is
[00:46:44] [ __ ] awesome one of the best ever and
[00:46:46] it's definitely up here
[00:46:47] at number five number four welcome to
[00:46:49] prime time
[00:46:50] [ __ ] night round down street three
[00:46:53] dream warriors
[00:46:54] i'm a little bit of an island on this
[00:46:57] one but there are quite a few people
[00:46:58] that agree with me
[00:46:59] i do prefer nightmare on elm street 3
[00:47:01] just by a razor thin
[00:47:03] edge to the first film honestly if the
[00:47:05] first film had a better
[00:47:07] ending it would easily be better than
[00:47:09] dream warriors to me but dream warriors
[00:47:11] is more rewatchable dream warriors is a
[00:47:12] little bit more entertaining a little
[00:47:14] bit more accessible it's kind of like
[00:47:15] phantasm and phantasm 2 here
[00:47:17] nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors
[00:47:19] takes everything that i love about the
[00:47:21] original film
[00:47:22] everything that i love about freddy
[00:47:24] everything i love about this franchise
[00:47:25] and just ramps it up to 11 gives you
[00:47:27] this bigger
[00:47:29] meaner badder sexier more
[00:47:32] entertaining sequel where the first one
[00:47:35] is psychological and is masterful and
[00:47:38] is iconic for how much it gets into your
[00:47:39] head this one is just a
[00:47:41] [ __ ] great time to watch it still has
[00:47:43] the horror it still has some of the
[00:47:45] greatest kills in the franchise
[00:47:47] it still has some of the most
[00:47:48] underappreciated physical
[00:47:50] practical effects that i've ever seen
[00:47:52] like with the mannequin kill
[00:47:54] but it's just so damn fun this is the
[00:47:56] one time
[00:47:58] the one time that they found the perfect
[00:48:00] mix of
[00:48:01] scary freddy and funny freddy and while
[00:48:04] some people will hold this movie
[00:48:05] accountable for the downfall of freddie
[00:48:07] i would hold four accountable for that
[00:48:09] so i don't even
[00:48:10] have that as a knock against three but
[00:48:12] this found the perfect mix of being
[00:48:14] dark disturbing nasty macabre freddy
[00:48:17] while having some of the most
[00:48:19] awesome iconic one-liners of all time
[00:48:22] like
[00:48:22] welcome to prime time [ __ ] which is
[00:48:24] probably the most popular
[00:48:26] even down to scenes where like you know
[00:48:27] his gloves come up as needles
[00:48:29] let's get high and there's just so many
[00:48:31] things in here that has that
[00:48:33] mtv generation flavor added to it that
[00:48:36] this is the one that i pop in the most
[00:48:38] when i'm in a freddy mood
[00:48:40] i would say eight out of ten times i
[00:48:42] throw in the third one and two out of
[00:48:44] ten times i throw in the first one
[00:48:45] unless i'm watching the whole franchise
[00:48:47] i just love this sequel
[00:48:49] so damn much and it doesn't hurt that
[00:48:51] there is one of the most
[00:48:52] badass 80s metal songs and one of the
[00:48:54] most badass movie soundtrack songs of
[00:48:56] all time and dream warriors here by
[00:48:58] docking
[00:48:59] stockhead night run on street three
[00:49:02] dream warriors
[00:49:03] is [ __ ] awesome number four on my top
[00:49:05] 50 of all time
[00:49:06] number three i'm coming for you rachel
[00:49:12] gage and i will catch you pet cemetery
[00:49:17] my god this movie it was so
[00:49:22] great when i was a kid and it was a
[00:49:24] movie that genuinely freaked me the [ __ ]
[00:49:26] out when i
[00:49:27] began this video talking to you about
[00:49:30] tim curry's pennywise
[00:49:31] and how there was two characters in
[00:49:33] horror history that ever
[00:49:35] genuinely [ __ ] me up as a kid the
[00:49:38] other one is zelda
[00:49:39] from pet cemetery and no matter how many
[00:49:41] times i watched this movie and knew what
[00:49:43] was around every corner
[00:49:45] every single time that i rewatched it
[00:49:47] with my dad i was always
[00:49:49] unnerved and always uneasy and almost
[00:49:52] without exception it would be pitch
[00:49:54] black it would be dark it was just us in
[00:49:56] the house and as soon as it got to
[00:49:57] zelda's parts i would look over to my
[00:49:58] dad
[00:49:59] and that [ __ ] would be asleep on the
[00:50:00] couch and i would just be like oh [ __ ]
[00:50:02] lola's going to get me
[00:50:04] pet cemetery is on this list
[00:50:07] easily just because of that but like
[00:50:10] some of the other movies that i've
[00:50:11] talked about
[00:50:12] whereas a lot of people look at this
[00:50:14] movie and say it hasn't aged well or say
[00:50:16] it was never really all that great in
[00:50:17] the first place
[00:50:18] to me this is the most effectively
[00:50:23] terrifying horror film that i have ever
[00:50:25] seen if this was a list of
[00:50:27] top 50 scariest horror films number one
[00:50:30] would be pet cemetery for me because
[00:50:32] there's something about the concept of
[00:50:34] grief and
[00:50:36] death and the refusal of acceptance and
[00:50:39] everything that they get into into this
[00:50:41] movie that just
[00:50:42] hits so hard for me since i've become a
[00:50:45] parent
[00:50:46] that this movie has evolved since i've
[00:50:48] watched it as a kid where it was
[00:50:50] genuinely scary
[00:50:51] and i've always loved it as a kid when i
[00:50:53] watch it as an adult it's got this
[00:50:55] extra thick layer of disturbing added to
[00:50:59] it that it
[00:50:59] genuinely [ __ ] me up when i watch it
[00:51:01] when i get to simple scenes like
[00:51:03] whenever
[00:51:04] lewis is holding the cold corpse of gage
[00:51:07] and he's just sitting there rocking it
[00:51:08] in the cold and the fog like that just
[00:51:10] makes me sick to my stomach
[00:51:12] and this movie is just genuinely
[00:51:13] terrifying
[00:51:15] for its concepts alone but the way that
[00:51:17] they utilize
[00:51:18] all the horror in this movie from the
[00:51:20] the weird kookiness
[00:51:22] here that shouldn't work and it's so off
[00:51:23] kilter that it just makes everything
[00:51:24] more disturbing to the way that zelda
[00:51:26] looks
[00:51:27] to the way that pascal looks to the
[00:51:29] sound design of the voices
[00:51:30] to even the way when gage finally comes
[00:51:32] and how disturbing he is it's just it's
[00:51:34] a movie that every single time that i
[00:51:37] watch it it
[00:51:38] affects me the same way as the first
[00:51:40] time that i watched it just the concept
[00:51:41] of a father
[00:51:42] and his family on this cursed land with
[00:51:46] this
[00:51:46] kind of unnerving neighbor because he
[00:51:48] has all this history of the darkness of
[00:51:50] this place
[00:51:52] played wonderfully by fred quinn by the
[00:51:54] way
[00:51:55] and to lose his son
[00:51:58] and be stuck with this
[00:52:01] moral quandary of do i lose my son
[00:52:04] forever
[00:52:04] or do i flip a coin and use this cursed
[00:52:07] land to possibly get him back
[00:52:12] even talking about it now i'm like i
[00:52:13] don't even know what words to give
[00:52:15] for how [ __ ] up and how effective that
[00:52:17] concept is and pet cemetery
[00:52:19] despite having a very disappointing
[00:52:21] remake that had so much more potential
[00:52:24] is still one of my favorite one of the
[00:52:26] most effective and for me
[00:52:28] the most genuinely scary horror films of
[00:52:31] all time and now we are at the top two
[00:52:33] now i've talked about
[00:52:34] ad nauseam how these two movies have
[00:52:37] always been my favorites and they kind
[00:52:38] of go back and forth so i kind of had to
[00:52:40] finally put my foot down
[00:52:42] and say which one is number one which
[00:52:43] one is number two as far as my favorite
[00:52:45] horror
[00:52:46] films and i'm pretty confident that
[00:52:48] that's how it will stay
[00:52:49] because when i really start to genuinely
[00:52:51] think about it
[00:52:53] number two is the lost boys for me now i
[00:52:56] love vampire films
[00:52:57] i love 80s films and this just has
[00:53:00] everything that i want it's one of the
[00:53:01] most stylistic and fun vampire films but
[00:53:04] it also has
[00:53:05] some really good horror edge to it i
[00:53:08] took my kids to go see this in theaters
[00:53:10] a couple of months ago it was
[00:53:11] one of three movies that i've seen in
[00:53:13] theaters since march
[00:53:14] and it was so cool to see this movie in
[00:53:18] theaters and kind of experience it that
[00:53:19] way and just kind of get sucked into the
[00:53:21] fun of this where it really embraces the
[00:53:23] 80s
[00:53:24] as an era it embraces some of the heavy
[00:53:27] metal rock crowd that's in there with
[00:53:29] some of
[00:53:29] the punk look of a lot of these vampires
[00:53:32] i mean keith for sutherland's david is
[00:53:33] just one of the most genuinely cool
[00:53:35] villains genuinely cool looking vampires
[00:53:37] ever but even the rest of his crew all
[00:53:39] the way down to
[00:53:40] to bill from bill and ted uh alex winter
[00:53:43] is just they're just cool you just want
[00:53:46] to hang out with them even though you
[00:53:46] know they're vampires you're like i'm
[00:53:47] gonna party with these guys
[00:53:49] and then you get these two brothers of
[00:53:50] michael and sam that you just really
[00:53:52] latch into their brother relationship
[00:53:54] and they're kind of
[00:53:55] broken a family with their divorced mom
[00:53:57] and having to move in with the dad and
[00:53:58] this shitty ass house and the shitty ass
[00:54:00] part of california
[00:54:02] and just the the genuine allure that
[00:54:04] these guys give to michael to kind of
[00:54:06] you know come party with us michael and
[00:54:08] you're like i get it that
[00:54:10] it's like the 80s era is inviting you
[00:54:13] in and the way that they utilize some of
[00:54:15] the classic rules of vampires and you
[00:54:17] get iconic characters like the frog
[00:54:19] brothers that come in that are telling
[00:54:20] you all of these rules and
[00:54:23] there's so much about this movie that i
[00:54:24] love i did a full review on it if you
[00:54:26] want to see all my thoughts
[00:54:27] it's there but there's nothing about
[00:54:29] this movie that i don't enjoy there's
[00:54:31] nothing that i don't love
[00:54:32] there's nothing that i would change it's
[00:54:34] just one of those films that
[00:54:35] as a young kid i found the vhs tape
[00:54:38] watched it
[00:54:39] and like terminator 2 was something that
[00:54:42] was just in constant rotation in my vhs
[00:54:44] i'm surprised that the [ __ ] tape did
[00:54:46] not rip off of those damn spindles
[00:54:49] because i was rewinding and replaying
[00:54:50] this movie on constant loop
[00:54:52] as a young kid and as an adult it's
[00:54:55] still on constant loot because it's
[00:54:56] [ __ ] awesome which leads us
[00:54:58] to number one my favorite horror film of
[00:55:00] all time
[00:55:01] and like a lot of you probably guessed
[00:55:03] it is john carpenter's
[00:55:05] the thing there's not much i can say
[00:55:09] about how incredible this movie is that
[00:55:10] i have not already said
[00:55:12] numerous times and that all of you
[00:55:13] probably have not already said numerous
[00:55:15] times this is a movie that came out that
[00:55:16] was not appreciated
[00:55:18] at all when it first hit release it
[00:55:20] actually almost ended
[00:55:21] john carpenter's career because it was
[00:55:23] such a failure
[00:55:25] financially and with critics critics
[00:55:27] hated this they thought it was
[00:55:28] disgusting it was weird
[00:55:29] and wanted nothing to do with it and now
[00:55:31] it is one of the most celebrated and one
[00:55:33] of the most
[00:55:34] cherished horror films of all time
[00:55:35] because it was just so far ahead
[00:55:38] of times especially with not just the
[00:55:40] concept but the special effects the
[00:55:42] practical effects
[00:55:44] this is the golden gem of practical
[00:55:47] effects when you want to talk about
[00:55:48] great practical effects in a horror film
[00:55:50] you talk about the thing
[00:55:52] and the effects the grossness that they
[00:55:53] were able to get out of
[00:55:55] anything that they used here it still
[00:55:58] ages
[00:55:58] perfectly there is nothing that looks
[00:56:00] dated or old-fashioned about this movie
[00:56:02] it's still impressive today
[00:56:04] if this movie was released this weekend
[00:56:06] we would still talk about how great the
[00:56:07] effects are
[00:56:09] the concept alone in this this paranoia
[00:56:12] inducing concept of there's this alien
[00:56:14] they can replicate human beings and
[00:56:16] other living creatures like dogs
[00:56:19] and you don't know who is the thing
[00:56:21] around you just becomes this
[00:56:22] gigantic claustrophobic tense
[00:56:26] paranoia trip to where you pick
[00:56:28] characters that you like like
[00:56:30] namely kurt russell who's pretty much
[00:56:31] the lead in the movie but you don't know
[00:56:33] who else to trust you don't know who
[00:56:35] else to like
[00:56:35] they could be the thing they could be
[00:56:37] the thing hell the main character could
[00:56:39] be the thing we don't know and then kind
[00:56:40] of going on this journey of not only
[00:56:43] trying to avoid becoming the thing but
[00:56:45] trying to figure out how to determine
[00:56:46] who is the thing
[00:56:47] and how to defeat the thing it's just
[00:56:50] it's a journey that i go on every time i
[00:56:52] watch this film
[00:56:53] and i'm continuously impressed with how
[00:56:55] well they're able to do that from the
[00:56:57] score
[00:56:58] to the way that they just use this
[00:56:59] antarctic background as this
[00:57:02] even though it's wide open they can go
[00:57:04] anywhere that they want
[00:57:05] because of the the nature of antarctica
[00:57:07] and how cold it is and how
