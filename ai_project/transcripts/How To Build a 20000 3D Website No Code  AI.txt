[00:00:00] these incredible 3D websites were all
[00:00:02] built without writing a single line of
[00:00:04] code but what if I told you that you
[00:00:06] could build your own $20,000 website
[00:00:08] with just three tools thanks to the
[00:00:10] power of no code and AI well today I'm
[00:00:13] not just going to be showing you how to
[00:00:14] build out this website I'm also going to
[00:00:16] show you how to go out and sell it so
[00:00:17] make sure to stick around to the end
[00:00:19] welcome to the lab my name is Christian
[00:00:20] we have a lot to cover right now so
[00:00:21] let's Jump Right In now this first tool
[00:00:23] allows you to build s maps and
[00:00:25] wireframes for your website in less than
[00:00:27] a minute and if you're not familiar with
[00:00:28] these terms a sitemap are all the pages
[00:00:30] that you're going to have inside of your
[00:00:32] website and a wireframe is all of the
[00:00:34] sections that you're going to have
[00:00:35] within each one of those pages so we're
[00:00:37] talking about the text the buttons the
[00:00:39] images now let's blow your mind this
[00:00:41] platform is called reloom and it allows
[00:00:43] you with just one prompt to build out
[00:00:45] the entire sit map in just a couple
[00:00:47] seconds you're going to see it build
[00:00:48] itself live so all you got to do is come
[00:00:50] down here and describe your company in
[00:00:52] one sentence so here I've put a roofing
[00:00:53] company called roof ninjas based in New
[00:00:56] Jersey let's generate this as we see
[00:00:58] live it is actually built out the
[00:01:00] homepage it's also determining which
[00:01:03] Pages you might want for your website
[00:01:05] but if we come in a little closer here
[00:01:06] we're going to see that it's actually
[00:01:07] created different sections for this
[00:01:09] homepage so each page has its own
[00:01:10] sections and we can choose to rearrange
[00:01:12] these sections to delete them Etc and if
[00:01:14] we scroll out we're going to see the
[00:01:15] different pages we can select for it to
[00:01:17] generate the content of this page a Blog
[00:01:20] that sounds great with blog post section
[00:01:22] what I show you next is what's going to
[00:01:23] start blowing your mind if you come to
[00:01:25] the top here you just click on wireframe
[00:01:27] it's literally going to build out every
[00:01:29] single single one of those pages in real
[00:01:31] time it is doing this in a matter of
[00:01:33] seconds in front of your eyes and it's
[00:01:35] creating not only each section that it's
[00:01:37] talked about but it's also actually
[00:01:39] copywriting inside of each one of these
[00:01:41] sections so just like that we have all
[00:01:42] these Pages built if we scroll in a
[00:01:43] little bit what we're going to see is
[00:01:45] that it's actually created not just the
[00:01:47] different sections but it's also created
[00:01:50] copyrighting it's created space for the
[00:01:52] images and this is just the very first
[00:01:53] step you can actually come in here and
[00:01:55] let's say that you don't like this
[00:01:56] header image you can come here and
[00:01:58] replace the component you can choose
[00:01:59] from a number of other components that
[00:02:00] it has here and it will rebuild that in
[00:02:03] real time with AI so you can now just
[00:02:04] come in here and adapt the wireframe as
[00:02:06] you'd like you can change all the copy
[00:02:08] in each one of these sections and now my
[00:02:09] friends things start getting spicy cuz
[00:02:11] we're now going to build out this entire
[00:02:12] thing in a matter of minutes with no
[00:02:14] code tools when we're happy with this we
[00:02:16] can come to the top right and we can
[00:02:17] click on these buttons and we can copy
[00:02:19] to webflow it is a no code website
[00:02:21] builder that allows you to drag and drop
[00:02:23] functionalities to build beautiful
[00:02:25] websites and we can copy this and we can
[00:02:27] actually straight up paste it inside of
[00:02:29] a flow project it's going to ask us to
[00:02:31] clone the style guide which is the
[00:02:33] entire look and feel of the website that
[00:02:34] we've created here and it's going to ask
[00:02:36] us also to download a plugin to make it
[00:02:39] easier for us to build inside of web
[00:02:41] flow then come here and click clone here
[00:02:43] it's going to create a new project
[00:02:44] inside of your webflow on this screen
[00:02:46] I'm just going to click create site
[00:02:48] we're going to call it we are no codes
[00:02:49] fantastic site and it's opened up inside
[00:02:50] a web flow the way to see if it worked
[00:02:52] you click here you're going to see
[00:02:53] there's a style guide right here I'm now
[00:02:55] going to go back into my project here
[00:02:56] I'm going to click here I'm going to
[00:02:58] copy the web flow I'm going to jump
[00:03:00] inside web flow I'm going to come here
[00:03:02] I'm going to delete everything from the
[00:03:04] wrapper here and then I can click on
[00:03:05] this and paste and so this built the
[00:03:07] entire homepage in just a couple of
[00:03:09] seconds and boom just like that it's
[00:03:10] created all the HTML all of the CSS and
[00:03:13] the JavaScript so it's built out a fully
[00:03:15] functional website with all the code
[00:03:17] behind it without writing a single line
[00:03:19] of code in a couple of minutes and if
[00:03:21] anything I've shown you so far has blown
[00:03:22] your mind you owe me a subscribe and if
[00:03:24] not keep watching cuz I'm going to earn
[00:03:25] that subscribe I'm going to blow your
[00:03:27] mind let's go so here we have a very
[00:03:28] beautiful website and we can come in
[00:03:30] here and we can change out all of these
[00:03:31] images we can connect the buttons but
[00:03:33] this is basically a static website so we
[00:03:35] would have to do a couple things to turn
[00:03:37] it into a high-end website so the next
[00:03:39] thing we're going to do is bring in
[00:03:40] beautiful animation just like these and
[00:03:42] again no coding required at all so this
[00:03:44] next tool is called spline and it is a
[00:03:47] 3D collaboration platform where you can
[00:03:49] create designs and you can integrate
[00:03:50] them specifically into your web flow
[00:03:52] projects too so when we log in here we
[00:03:54] can either generate one use new files I
[00:03:56] can go and check out the different
[00:03:57] things in the library and let's see ooh
[00:03:59] I like this thing here let's import this
[00:04:02] inside our project and there's a full
[00:04:03] interface for you to be able to adapt it
[00:04:05] here but for the sake of this example
[00:04:07] I'm going to go quickly and let's say
[00:04:08] that we're ready to export this to our
[00:04:10] project so what I'm going to do is I'm
[00:04:12] going to go ahead and click on the play
[00:04:14] settings I'm going to select the
[00:04:15] animations that I want I do not want it
[00:04:17] to be able to zoom in for example and
[00:04:19] let's just say I'm good with all the
[00:04:20] rest I'm going to update this public URL
[00:04:22] you always want to do that once you've
[00:04:23] adapted something inside this panel and
[00:04:26] then we're going to go to viewer so I'm
[00:04:27] going to come in viewer here I'm going
[00:04:28] to click on this copy button for this
[00:04:31] link and then I'm going to head over to
[00:04:32] web flow I'm going to go inside my
[00:04:34] project and I'm going to pretty much add
[00:04:36] over here an element now this element we
[00:04:39] can actually select spline because they
[00:04:41] have an integration which is beautiful
[00:04:43] I'm just going to go ahead and paste
[00:04:45] this in here boom it's created it so
[00:04:47] that's great but we actually realized
[00:04:48] that there's background here and this is
[00:04:50] too small so we're going to jump back
[00:04:51] into spline over here and we're going to
[00:04:53] go to play settings we're going to take
[00:04:54] out the background again we're going to
[00:04:57] update you might even want to reduce the
[00:04:59] size SI of this a little bit just
[00:05:01] because it seemed a little bit big on
[00:05:02] that website then we're going to click
[00:05:04] on export again and again we're going to
[00:05:05] update the viewer so go ahead and copy
[00:05:09] that we're going to come back inside of
[00:05:11] here we're going to click inside the
[00:05:13] scene we're going to switch out this
[00:05:16] link boom just like that it looks good
[00:05:18] Okay cool so now we're going to go and
[00:05:19] play it we're going to see what this
[00:05:21] looks like live awesome so just like
[00:05:23] that we've Incorporated this little 3D
[00:05:24] that as you can see moves around with
[00:05:26] the mouse which is pretty cool and this
[00:05:28] is going to be the kind of thing gives
[00:05:30] it a very expensive little touch to it
[00:05:32] right and just like that with zero code
[00:05:34] you've created a first version now what
[00:05:36] do we have to do to make this a $2,000
[00:05:38] website well there's a couple of things
[00:05:40] first of all you're going to want to add
[00:05:41] your logo you're going to want to put in
[00:05:42] beautiful photography you could also
[00:05:44] have 3D models that basically adapt and
[00:05:46] move down your website as you actually
[00:05:48] scroll so there's so many things you can
[00:05:50] do with 3D animation you can adapt all
[00:05:52] the styling here just by going once into
[00:05:54] the style guide over here and just
[00:05:56] adapting the individual buttons that you
[00:05:58] see inside of here so if you want to
[00:05:59] change for example the look and feel of
[00:06:01] a button you could go down here and you
[00:06:03] could basically just change one little
[00:06:06] UI element like a button and it will
[00:06:07] change throughout the entire project so
[00:06:09] let's just go back now to the homepage
[00:06:11] and we're going to see now that all the
[00:06:12] black buttons are now green and you can
[00:06:14] also add all sorts of functionalities
[00:06:16] through these apps down here which will
[00:06:18] allow you to extend the functionality
[00:06:19] and to go from a just $5,000 website to
[00:06:22] a $20,000 3D website okay so you've
[00:06:24] showed us how to build it how do you go
[00:06:26] out there and get customers though well
[00:06:27] the first thing you can do is create a
[00:06:29] port folio website so have a first
[00:06:31] beautiful website that you can showcase
[00:06:33] to clients so that when you show up and
[00:06:35] say hey I'd like to build a website for
[00:06:36] you they can take you seriously now to
[00:06:38] find people who can afford $20,000 for a
[00:06:40] website I would probably Target
[00:06:42] businesses who can actually afford that
[00:06:44] kind of money and to do that I'd
[00:06:45] probably use a platform called built
[00:06:47] with which allows us to find out which
[00:06:48] websites are built on potentially some
[00:06:50] old school kind of software and once I
[00:06:52] had a list of companies that are
[00:06:53] generating more than a million dollars a
[00:06:55] year but have very clunky websites I
[00:06:57] would actually start looking on LinkedIn
[00:06:59] for the people who work at that specific
[00:07:01] company who might be in the marketing
[00:07:02] department or if it's a small medium
[00:07:04] business I would probably start with
[00:07:05] direct Outreach on LinkedIn letting them
[00:07:07] know that I've checked out their website
[00:07:09] potentially recording a short video of
[00:07:10] me going over their website and telling
[00:07:12] them what I think they could improve at
[00:07:14] the end of that short video I would talk
[00:07:15] about my services and showcase a
[00:07:17] beautiful website I had built with
[00:07:18] webflow no code and AI now to sell a
[00:07:20] $20,000 website it has to come with
[00:07:22] $20,000 support which means that they
[00:07:24] want reactivity so as soon as I got an
[00:07:26] answer from them I would basically
[00:07:28] create a sitemap and and I could share
[00:07:30] it here within reloom saying hey here's
[00:07:32] what I think the structure might look
[00:07:33] like ask them if they have any thoughts
[00:07:34] about the layout and then you could
[00:07:36] basically show them the wireframe within
[00:07:38] just a couple of seconds as well and you
[00:07:39] could say hey here's how I see all of
[00:07:41] these sections potentially working
[00:07:42] together so now you've been able to show
[00:07:44] them your proactive and together with
[00:07:45] the example of the website that you've
[00:07:47] created you're also going to have
[00:07:48] credibility and already starting to take
[00:07:50] first steps in the direction of building
[00:07:51] out their website even before they pay
[00:07:53] for it you're hopefully able to close
[00:07:55] the deal and then you can send me my 10%
[00:07:56] commission and we're good to go and that
[00:07:58] my friends is how you build and sell a
[00:07:59] website but if you want to learn more
[00:08:00] ways to generate money with no code and
[00:08:02] AI I highly recommend that you check out
[00:08:04] this video because I'm going to be
[00:08:05] showing you seven no code AI tools that
[00:08:08] can make you a millionaire thanks for
[00:08:09] watching let's go
