[00:00:00] in my head I was very sure have to go to
[00:00:03] I don't know what would have happened if
[00:00:04] you're not from IM you really don't talk
[00:00:06] about your college degree right so I
[00:00:08] started uh around 12 or 13 but it
[00:00:11] included a house in Mumbai oh nice you
[00:00:14] win you win so in 2020 I had my
[00:00:16] internship and that offer got revoked I
[00:00:18] posted on LinkedIn saying this and this
[00:00:19] has happened and uh within a few hours I
[00:00:21] had hundreds of uh alms coming to the
[00:00:25] post and I had a bunch of offers already
[00:00:26] in a couple of days even the network
[00:00:28] that we make right that network is also
[00:00:30] so more or less where I am they're not
[00:00:31] at that level where I am a or a B guy
[00:00:33] can
[00:00:38] be so the question is perception of I am
[00:00:42] and non am folks in the workplace you
[00:00:44] come out of college on front foot right
[00:00:46] it's not like you are having any sort of
[00:00:48] imposter syndrome you know have to make
[00:00:50] it big it's
[00:00:53] like and at that time you on top of the
[00:00:56] world right it also in a way uh adds to
[00:00:59] the confidence right like I'm on a
[00:01:00] career break right now no one like it's
[00:01:03] okay I can be on a career break for 6
[00:01:04] more months nothing will change in my
[00:01:06] life probably another person who does
[00:01:08] not have the same access saying when I
[00:01:12] decide now I can still reach out to 10
[00:01:13] people and figure out a job for myself
[00:01:15] may not pay the same but at least I'll
[00:01:17] get a decent job that security if you
[00:01:19] don't have it automatically starts
[00:01:20] changing the way you look at career
[00:01:22] decisions growth decisions and to add to
[00:01:25] that it's it's beli that people have
[00:01:26] done their their hard work at that time
[00:01:28] not that others Haven so guy must be
[00:01:30] ready for that even in the corporates I
[00:01:32] wish that were true but but yeah I mean
[00:01:36] see the perception is always that you
[00:01:38] know pedigree brings you a certain
[00:01:40] Baseline quality which probably is there
[00:01:42] in a non am but you will have to take
[00:01:44] the effort to establish itly so instead
[00:01:46] B B I'm getting you know good talent
[00:01:48] which I can bet on so let's go ahead but
[00:01:51] honestly like that perception only stays
[00:01:53] till that CV until you hire it's almost
[00:01:55] like saying that if you're not from I am
[00:01:56] you really don't talk about your college
[00:01:58] degree right unless you're like an i FMS
[00:02:00] or you know I beyond that it really
[00:02:03] doesn't matter I graduated in 2021 uh so
[00:02:05] in 2020 I we had to intern right after
[00:02:09] the first year so I had my internship
[00:02:10] and because of covid that offer got
[00:02:12] revoked I posted on LinkedIn saying this
[00:02:14] and this has happened and we'll be
[00:02:16] looking for opportunities and I think
[00:02:18] within a few hours I had hundreds of uh
[00:02:20] alarms coming to the post and personally
[00:02:23] messaging me saying that don't worry we
[00:02:25] can offer you and I had a bunch of
[00:02:27] offers already in a couple of days
[00:02:28] that's amazing I wish had heard this
[00:02:30] before I chose my college because I was
[00:02:32] in the travel industry so I had a 50%
[00:02:35] pay cut uh then that 50% pay almost
[00:02:39] became a norm then you got a you know
[00:02:41] the you increment so you go ahead then
[00:02:43] you come back do uh non folks also have
[00:02:46] any perception of I am people being like
[00:02:48] stuck up and like oh they are in their
[00:02:50] own world I'm just asking I can imagine
[00:02:52] like that also being true it is what it
[00:02:55] is right I am have this sort of glow to
[00:02:58] it so I've seen teams getting created
[00:03:00] where it's you know it's a I am
[00:03:02] Bangalore club and this was my first job
[00:03:04] right so there was 2 years of MBA and
[00:03:05] before that I had given cat so I had
[00:03:07] given cat I had given the same exam that
[00:03:08] everyone has given and I had not managed
[00:03:10] to get through so that was quite fresh
[00:03:13] in my mind that you know the rest of the
[00:03:14] team has done something which I have not
[00:03:16] been able to do no salaries are
[00:03:18] transparent right so you end up sort of
[00:03:19] knowing where everyone else is you know
[00:03:21] so I I did give it sort of um a little
[00:03:25] extra in the initial years to sort of
[00:03:28] catch up and not only at workplace even
[00:03:30] outside that I remember a couple of
[00:03:31] years back I was trying to get some sort
[00:03:33] of funding for I not got a startup but
[00:03:35] something that I am involved in I used
[00:03:37] to reach to that Network because I know
[00:03:39] someone who knows someone and who knows
[00:03:41] someone for me it's a long row so and
[00:03:44] then to break that uh door or a barrier
[00:03:46] is extremely difficult even outside your
[00:03:48] workplace so in fact in my first job I
[00:03:50] was surrounded by people from iits I was
[00:03:52] non then and I actually went through
[00:03:55] this journey then right like seeing why
[00:03:57] like I'm also doing the same work just
[00:03:59] because he or she's from an i KGB Mumbai
[00:04:02] Delhi one like they are getting a better
[00:04:04] designation all of that so in my head I
[00:04:06] was very sure be MBA have to go
[00:04:09] to I don't know what would have happened
[00:04:11] but in my head I had I had actually
[00:04:13] corrected for that situation right and
[00:04:16] made peace I think we'll have to really
[00:04:18] you know be very creative to say that
[00:04:19] there's a disadvantage of passing out of
[00:04:21] an
[00:04:25] IM my starting salary out of Campus was
[00:04:28] about 20 of it something three and a
[00:04:30] half or something was deferred which I
[00:04:31] would get after 3 years and something
[00:04:33] like that but m m like between 16 17 is
[00:04:36] what I would uh earn with variable pay
[00:04:39] when I left ABG 8 years later I was
[00:04:41] about 2x of that salary my last role in
[00:04:45] um dunzo was about 2 x off that salary
[00:04:49] so somewhere between 85 to 90ish so flip
[00:04:53] cart uh initially offered around 35 as a
[00:04:57] starting thing it also includes stocks
[00:04:59] by the way I think over the past 3 years
[00:05:01] that number has actually more or less
[00:05:03] doubled so you took like four years to
[00:05:04] double around 3 years for me that was
[00:05:07] around 7 years right so maybe it's also
[00:05:09] a time not it is also a factor of the
[00:05:12] market and I the advantage right the
[00:05:13] base is there for you guys to to even
[00:05:15] begin with and that's how the numbers
[00:05:17] explode even if it's a 2X thing and even
[00:05:20] if someone has to take a cut or the bad
[00:05:22] situations like lefs and all like you
[00:05:23] mentioned easy for you guys to recover
[00:05:25] from that put put it in your lemoni
[00:05:27] network and someone is there for as a
[00:05:28] support system for me the best
[00:05:30] placements that you can get like that's
[00:05:31] from symbis will be around say Max 14 15
[00:05:35] LP at that time so I passed out at
[00:05:37] around 12 something and then with uh
[00:05:39] five six years now after my MBA and even
[00:05:42] by after utilizing my network right I
[00:05:44] have grown it by I think three or 4X I
[00:05:47] would say 4X or somewhere around that
[00:05:49] because the base was very less to to
[00:05:50] start with you still cannot reach an
[00:05:52] extremely high levels and all so I
[00:05:54] started uh trying to remember this was
[00:05:56] 2012 and it was significantly lower than
[00:05:59] the numbers that you mentioned it was
[00:06:01] around uh 12 or 13 but it included
[00:06:05] bonuses and variables and all of that
[00:06:07] and uh uh it included a house in Mumbai
[00:06:11] ohce you win you
[00:06:13] win so it does that to you uh as an
[00:06:16] employer where you get a house you get a
[00:06:18] playground you get a school you get a
[00:06:20] hospital you know so people never
[00:06:25] leave every time I changed a job I think
[00:06:28] I got around 30 35% hike on what I had
[00:06:32] before but in my current role it grew to
[00:06:35] a level where it was around six or seven
[00:06:39] times of what I started with in any
[00:06:41] organizations once you cross a
[00:06:43] particular salary you are looked at as
[00:06:46] an investment or an expense say you get
[00:06:48] 50 lakhs you have to you know deliver 5x
[00:06:51] of that for you to be around and that
[00:06:53] has become more and more true since the
[00:06:57] pandemic and that is irrelevant
[00:06:58] depending on which uh College you come
[00:07:00] from maybe for IMS it happens a little
[00:07:02] early stretching this point a little
[00:07:04] further than what it was uh you think
[00:07:06] after 12 years of experience things have
[00:07:09] evened out for let's say a guy who has
[00:07:11] started from I and others my point of
[00:07:14] view will be a little different from
[00:07:16] everyone else's I am 40 right so things
[00:07:21] change in terms of what what do you want
[00:07:24] what do you count as success so and I
[00:07:26] had a baby recently my priority is to
[00:07:29] find a you know job which lets me
[00:07:31] witness his initial years in the best
[00:07:34] possible I think this is my Peak
[00:07:35] happiness level I don't see uh me
[00:07:38] creating my own startup or raising more
[00:07:40] money making me more happier than this
[00:07:42] right I don't know if I helped you or
[00:07:43] confused you further but no but I think
[00:07:45] that's a very interesting uh thing so
[00:07:47] I'll tell you we recently and very
[00:07:49] similarly we went to campus in December
[00:07:52] for our 10 year reunion and we had also
[00:07:53] going to campus in a five year reunion
[00:07:54] just the difference in how you interact
[00:07:56] with your peers in a fiveyear reunion
[00:07:58] where people are still like who you know
[00:08:00] where are you from to which you know
[00:08:02] which company what designation what pay
[00:08:04] like everyone is in different life
[00:08:05] stages but when we met in December
[00:08:07] probably 10 years and one pandemic later
[00:08:10] everyone was just like you know we have
[00:08:13] bigger things better things and what we
[00:08:15] measure as success actually changes and
[00:08:17] that is more human it has nothing to do
[00:08:19] with what where you got your degree from
[00:08:20] so overall maybe it does even out but I
[00:08:22] think that starting like can I do a cold
[00:08:25] message to someone on LinkedIn that
[00:08:27] probably Advantage I'll still have non I
[00:08:30] may not
[00:08:31] it apart from education what other
[00:08:34] qualities helped you get to where you
[00:08:35] are I'm actually thinking very hard what
[00:08:39] what did
[00:08:41] education I come from a middle class
[00:08:43] right at least in India I think
[00:08:45] education is a very big factor maybe
[00:08:46] after 10 years uh that factor will go
[00:08:49] down by a significant bit and other
[00:08:52] factors like experience competence and
[00:08:55] relevance to that industry might become
[00:08:56] more but at this stage I think love for
[00:08:58] the problem statement and education play
[00:09:00] a big fair I I I can relate to that
[00:09:02] learning becomes easy if you like what
[00:09:04] you're doing and I think I'm the only
[00:09:05] one who thinks irrespective of what you
[00:09:07] doing you you'll have to do it and
[00:09:09] you'll have to love it right even if you
[00:09:11] get that you don't get that yeah should
[00:09:13] be done the ability or the attitude to
[00:09:16] take risks uh for me has only grown as
[00:09:22] as my you know career or my years have
[00:09:24] actually progressed which I think comes
[00:09:26] from both pedigree comes from credit
[00:09:29] ility and actually I honestly think that
[00:09:31] it also comes from the kind of person
[00:09:33] you are I mean I have enough and more
[00:09:35] friends who are from IM AMS probably
[00:09:38] hate their jobs have enough financial
[00:09:41] security than I do but will not take a
[00:09:43] break yeah in my opinion risk is a
[00:09:47] factor of privilege when I say privilege
[00:09:50] not necessarily you know generational
[00:09:52] wealth right for example my wife works
[00:09:54] and we didn't have any dependencies so
[00:09:56] it's never going to be a scenario of
[00:09:57] that you know you know no no job then
[00:10:00] you know you can't eat it or that's a
[00:10:02] privilege that none of us can uh deny
[00:10:05] deny the way I look at risks is more
[00:10:08] from a function of where the market is
[00:10:10] moving where the challenging problems
[00:10:11] are rather than a function of other
[00:10:13] external factors given whatever
[00:10:15] background that I have it gives me
[00:10:17] flexibility to choose those problems
[00:10:19] nice I love the answer sorry just adding
[00:10:21] to it right it's it's just not about you
[00:10:23] know switching jobs or you know that is
[00:10:25] at risk where you're working what
[00:10:27] industry you're working is also you know
[00:10:29] essentially at risk and something
[00:10:32] happened to me so when I was with jet
[00:10:34] jet jet a closed down and I was actually
[00:10:37] out of a job for some time I when I went
[00:10:39] through that phase I realized that this
[00:10:42] is not as bad as I thought it would as I
[00:10:46] thought it would be right as in it was
[00:10:48] okay and and what helps me on the other
[00:10:50] side is that me my wife my parents we've
[00:10:52] always been very very frugal in
[00:10:54] everything we consciously not bought a
[00:10:55] house we got our first car after both of
[00:11:00] us had worked for almost 10 years so you
[00:11:02] know we've delayed all of those
[00:11:04] purchases to build in that Financial
[00:11:07] Freedom Freedom similarly not bought a
[00:11:09] house Car 2 three years back I'm saying
[00:11:12] I can sit without job for 6 months
[00:11:15] expense essentially I think that is
[00:11:17] something that I wish someone had told
[00:11:19] me 10 years back when I graduated by you
[00:11:21] know from day one just start planning
[00:11:23] our finances better I was lucky I
[00:11:25] started at like my first paycheck I
[00:11:27] think it's question
[00:11:30] good we have a few non are behind where
[00:11:34] do you invest what are your financial
[00:11:36] goals I think 75 80% off of it is in
[00:11:38] equity I have around 6 months of
[00:11:40] expenses which are liquid yeah so that's
[00:11:43] the split I have and is actually a funny
[00:11:46] story I don't know I should maybe I
[00:11:47] should tell you is that because I'm
[00:11:49] pretty bad at
[00:11:50] Finance saying it out loud my strategy
[00:11:53] of investing was looking at things that
[00:11:55] I see so uh so I was unwell one day and
[00:12:00] I you know I was given a tablet so it
[00:12:04] was I think aial and then voral and I
[00:12:07] looked that both of them were being
[00:12:09] manufactured by the same company then I
[00:12:10] went to a few medical stores and said
[00:12:12] that is voril you know he said H this is
[00:12:14] the best this is the medicine that
[00:12:16] everyone takes so I went Ahad and
[00:12:18] invested so that's the stock which is
[00:12:19] now you know really M so that's how I
[00:12:22] have I really haven't looked at
[00:12:24] technicals per se I've looked at
[00:12:26] companies that I want to own a piece of
[00:12:28] and then that's have I invested for me
[00:12:30] uh around 70% of my uh portfolio is in
[00:12:33] equity uh with mutual fund as an
[00:12:36] instrument that I use uh uh I think 10
[00:12:39] to 15% will be bonds and fds and rest I
[00:12:43] keep it as a buffer for emergency cash
[00:12:46] and other things okay so for me split is
[00:12:48] again 75 80% Equity but again mutual
[00:12:51] funds right 20% de I mean Financial
[00:12:54] goalwise I honestly don't want to work
[00:12:57] in a corporate life for too much much
[00:12:59] time at some point wanting to be able to
[00:13:01] work purely for joy that number to me is
[00:13:05] 3x of what I have today but so at some
[00:13:08] point I will reach it I hope so my split
[00:13:11] is uh 80% equity and then 20 debt I
[00:13:15] think for me goal is again to be uh
[00:13:18] financially free and keep on working I
[00:13:20] have a number in my mind for me it's
[00:13:22] like almost there let's see 2 months 3
[00:13:25] months or what what time it takes
[00:13:26] depending on the markets I think from a
[00:13:28] fin Financial goal point of view my
[00:13:31] Outlook has again changed recently this
[00:13:35] I've seen a lot of times right you
[00:13:36] talked to a new new father new mother
[00:13:38] the Outlook complete changes for life
[00:13:40] and other things also right significant
[00:13:42] you probably haven't heard what I'm
[00:13:44] going to say next but what I realized is
[00:13:48] that you know I I'm from a small very
[00:13:52] small town in North karnat all of my
[00:13:54] family is there so my goal is to you
[00:13:57] know move out of
[00:13:59] the city and go back I'll have to
[00:14:02] probably you know take on a different
[00:14:04] kind of a profile but I would want to go
[00:14:06] back to you know to my hometown and stay
[00:14:09] there and would want him to grow up
[00:14:11] there yeah same I don't want to set so
[00:14:13] when I say work for joy that that Joy
[00:14:16] does not involve any Metro city in India
[00:14:17] today so it has to be somewhere else
[00:14:20] like 8 10 years ago there was this
[00:14:22] aspiration of everyone having you
[00:14:25] know that is my go now everyone is like
[00:14:28] yeah I want to go a tier three town and
[00:14:30] have a big house see that just changes
[00:14:33] the way then you start thinking of how
[00:14:34] you want to manage your money also right
[00:14:36] what impact does your degree have after
[00:14:38] 5 years of
[00:14:40] experience you want answer you I have a
[00:14:43] total six years of experience just to
[00:14:46] officially clear that but after yes
[00:14:48] three years you guys are the best people
[00:14:51] to answer the last job that I applied in
[00:14:54] like a field of filled an online form
[00:14:56] and applied for a job was in 2016 and
[00:14:58] after after that I switched uh three
[00:15:01] jobs so what the point I'm trying to
[00:15:03] make is that it's after that it's your
[00:15:06] uh you know what the work that you've
[00:15:07] done the people that you worked with the
[00:15:09] references that you get so it stops
[00:15:11] becoming uh I would say I would not say
[00:15:13] stop but it stops becoming a de deterent
[00:15:17] from my perspective it not only gave me
[00:15:19] a great professional path I also think
[00:15:22] an MB taught me a lot of life lessons
[00:15:24] honestly like resilience like dealing
[00:15:27] with pressure building networks with
[00:15:30] people whom you don't really meet on a
[00:15:32] day-to-day basis I also by the way think
[00:15:34] that the degree also has an edge by the
[00:15:35] way like pedigree specifically which I
[00:15:38] found a lot of value in was the network
[00:15:40] of women IMS women at IMs you know at a
[00:15:43] certain age or like 30 35 Beach a lot of
[00:15:46] non am women and I'm not generalizing
[00:15:49] this but it becomes harder because they
[00:15:51] also have lesser of aspirational or
[00:15:53] inspirational role models to look at I
[00:15:55] just feel like I have like anytime I
[00:15:57] look around I have someone who who like
[00:15:59] 20 years older a graduate from IM
[00:16:02] Kolkata who is who is like her daughter
[00:16:05] is now my age probably but is living
[00:16:08] like life amazingly right so I have
[00:16:11] aspirations and Inspirations in terms of
[00:16:13] Role Models which probably people who
[00:16:15] don't have this pedigree don't have
[00:16:17] access to so I just wanted to rephrase
[00:16:19] the question a little bit U is it also a
[00:16:22] function of doing an MBA versus not
[00:16:23] doing an MBA if I see a typical career
[00:16:26] road map for someone passing got from
[00:16:29] engineering College not a tier one thing
[00:16:30] but College they go to IT service
[00:16:32] industry right in fees and tcss of the
[00:16:34] world if some a person stays in a
[00:16:36] technical world right their career
[00:16:38] mostly kind of ends when they are in 40
[00:16:40] 42s right now within MBA what they can
[00:16:43] do is after three to four years go to
[00:16:44] some managerial role and not a core Tech
[00:16:47] kind of a company in Fe kind of a
[00:16:49] company and then probably have a add a
[00:16:51] decade to their career maybe in a sales
[00:16:53] role right in a leadership role or that
[00:16:54] sort of a place so I think that way
[00:16:56] someone ask me is it worth it even today
[00:16:58] I definitely yes so from a industry
[00:17:00] point of view right as I cannot think of
[00:17:03] an industry where an MBA would not help
[00:17:07] I have a actually point of view here in
[00:17:09] the roles which have matured it's say
[00:17:11] Marketing sales even product has become
[00:17:14] matured the last uh decade or so right
[00:17:17] their MBA degrees and so-called other
[00:17:20] degrees which are relevant to that role
[00:17:21] will matter but as we see more of more
[00:17:24] and more people like a bunch of us also
[00:17:26] are hired by startups for more generic
[00:17:29] roles right where you have to wear
[00:17:32] different hats do different things and
[00:17:34] uh get stuff done right in those
[00:17:36] situations I feel if you as a person are
[00:17:40] coachable you come with the learning
[00:17:42] attitude you can still make it in those
[00:17:44] Ro then MBA or not does not matter much
[00:17:48] as long as somebody's going to take a
[00:17:50] bet on you and you are going to come to
[00:17:52] on that bet those questions become
[00:17:54] irrelevant we Bridge the I am non am
