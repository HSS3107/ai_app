[00:00:03] The future
[00:00:04] isn't what it used to be.
[00:00:06] The future we dreamt of was shiny,
[00:00:08] sleek and impossibly optimistic...
[00:00:10] or was it?
[00:00:11] We think of the future
[00:00:12] as forward facing, yet
[00:00:13] our imaginations return
[00:00:15] to familiar patterns.
[00:00:16] Do these visions reveal deeper
[00:00:17] truths about who we are
[00:00:18] and what we long for?
[00:00:20] Are we really moving forward?
[00:00:22] Or just circling back to ideas
[00:00:24] we never truly left behind?
[00:00:29] ‚ÄúThe wings unfold to a span
[00:00:31] of 12 yards
[00:00:31] and presto, it‚Äôs a plane.
[00:00:34] The flying car has room
[00:00:36] for two passengers
[00:00:37] and develops 125 horsepower.
[00:00:39] Air speed is over
[00:00:40] 200 miles an hour.‚Äù
[00:00:41] Why do flying
[00:00:42] cars in the 1950s
[00:00:43] still look more futuristic
[00:00:45] than most cars today?
[00:00:46] The answer lies in Retrofuturism,
[00:00:48] where tomorrow's dreams
[00:00:49] are always filtered
[00:00:50] through yesterday's glasses.
[00:00:52] Retrofuturism isn't just a look,
[00:00:54] it's a way of seeing the future
[00:00:55] through the past.
[00:00:56] It merges vintage aesthetics
[00:00:58] with the futuristic concepts,
[00:00:59] a vision of tomorrow
[00:01:00] wrapped in nostalgia.
[00:01:02] It's a reflection
[00:01:02] of how each era sees the future
[00:01:04] shaped by the culture
[00:01:06] and the values of the time.
[00:01:07] It's in architecture,
[00:01:08] technology, entertainment,
[00:01:09] even the way we express
[00:01:10] our hopes and anxieties.
[00:01:15] In the
[00:01:15] age of steam and iron,
[00:01:16] Victorian futurists
[00:01:17] imagined machines
[00:01:18] that fed knowledge directly
[00:01:20] into our minds, and steam
[00:01:21] powered automatons.
[00:01:23] Their future was industrial
[00:01:24] and distinctly Victorian.
[00:01:26] The 20s and 30s
[00:01:27] saw the future differently.
[00:01:28] Streamlined,
[00:01:29] efficient and elegant.
[00:01:30] The Chrysler Building
[00:01:31] wasn't just architecture,
[00:01:32] it was a vision of tomorrow.
[00:01:34] By the 1950s,
[00:01:35] the Atomic Age arrived.
[00:01:36] Diners looked like spaceships,
[00:01:37] and televisions
[00:01:38] like space helmets.
[00:01:39] ‚ÄúExcitingly new...‚Äù
[00:01:42] It was optimistic,
[00:01:43] accessible
[00:01:44] and distinctly American.
[00:01:48] ‚ÄúYou find yourself
[00:01:49] living predictions of things
[00:01:51] to come.‚Äù
[00:01:52] Oftentimes the future we imagine
[00:01:54] is the world we live in.
[00:01:55] The Space Age
[00:01:56] gave us Tomorrowland.
[00:01:57] A sleek, idealized vision
[00:01:59] of a prosperous
[00:02:00] tomorrow, reflecting
[00:02:01] mid-century optimism
[00:02:02] and faith in technology.
[00:02:04] The 1980s,
[00:02:05] with its financial anxieties
[00:02:06] and corporate dominance,
[00:02:07] gave rise to Blade Runner, where
[00:02:09] technology and humanity clash
[00:02:10] in a gritty, neon lit metropolis.
[00:02:13] In times of prosperity,
[00:02:14] the future looked
[00:02:14] sleek and optimistic.
[00:02:16] During downturns, it
[00:02:17] grew dark and dystopian.
[00:02:19] But not everyone dreamed the
[00:02:20] same future.
[00:02:22] While America showcased
[00:02:24] personal luxury; flying
[00:02:25] cars, robot maids
[00:02:26] and automated homes serving
[00:02:28] individual families...
[00:02:29] Japan's imagined futures blurred
[00:02:31] the line
[00:02:31] between human and machine.
[00:02:33] Despite being a robot,
[00:02:34] Astro Boy
[00:02:35] moved with natural grace
[00:02:36] and struggled with human emotions.
[00:02:38] ‚ÄúFrom now on, you belong to him.
[00:02:40] Huh?
[00:02:41] Oh, no, Bobby, you can't!‚Äù
[00:02:44] And in the Soviet
[00:02:44] Union, animations like this
[00:02:46] emphasized time efficiency
[00:02:47] and collective productivity.
[00:02:49] Their future wasn't
[00:02:50] about personal comfort,
[00:02:51] but about optimizing every minute
[00:02:53] for the good of society.
[00:02:54] Even their cartoons
[00:02:55] reinforced that tomorrow
[00:02:56] would be built through coordinated
[00:02:58] collective effort.
[00:02:59] The futures
[00:03:00] we imagine
[00:03:00] often reveal
[00:03:01] as much about the present
[00:03:02] as they do about what lies ahead.
[00:03:04] These weren't just different
[00:03:05] artistic styles.
[00:03:06] They were different
[00:03:07] dreams of tomorrow,
[00:03:08] each reflecting their society's
[00:03:10] core values
[00:03:11] about how progress
[00:03:12] should serve their people.
[00:03:13] And these different visions
[00:03:14] still influence
[00:03:15] how each society engages
[00:03:16] with new technologies.
[00:03:18] In Japan,
[00:03:18] robots are often designed
[00:03:20] with explicit
[00:03:21] mechanical features
[00:03:22] reflecting a cultural comfort
[00:03:23] with visible automation.
[00:03:25] In contrast,
[00:03:25] Western markets often
[00:03:27] prefer AI assistants
[00:03:28] that simulate human conversation.
[00:03:30] Building on familiar
[00:03:31] social interactions.
[00:03:32] ‚ÄúAiight I got you.
[00:03:34] What's on yo mind?‚Äù
[00:03:36] ‚ÄúShit I'm chillin.
[00:03:37] What you got going on?‚Äù
[00:03:42] ‚ÄúHis assignments are programed
[00:03:44] into the home computer
[00:03:46] and fed into teaching machines.‚Äù
[00:03:58] Sometimes
[00:03:59] yesterday's wild
[00:04:00] dreams of tomorrow did come true.
[00:04:02] Just not quite as I imagined.
[00:04:08] Video
[00:04:09] calls arrived,
[00:04:09] but not in clunky briefcases.
[00:04:12] We got robot assistants,
[00:04:14] but they live in our phones
[00:04:15] rather than rolling
[00:04:16] around on wheels.
[00:04:17] And we can now receive
[00:04:18] text messages on our wrists.
[00:04:20] But thankfully not as clunky
[00:04:21] printed strips
[00:04:22] imagined in the world
[00:04:23] of James Bond.
[00:04:24] So what made some ideas
[00:04:26] succeed while others failed?
[00:04:27] Video calls succeeded
[00:04:29] because they addressed
[00:04:30] our need
[00:04:30] to see distant loved ones,
[00:04:31] regardless of the form they took.
[00:04:33] Success
[00:04:33] wasn't about correctly guessing
[00:04:35] the exact shape of technology,
[00:04:37] but understanding the human
[00:04:39] desires it would serve.
[00:04:41] ‚ÄúAll muscle.‚Äù
[00:04:44] ‚ÄúIt's a new thing.
[00:04:44] It plays games.‚Äù
[00:04:46] ‚ÄúAll electric.‚Äù
[00:04:47] ‚ÄúThese are simulated
[00:04:48] engine sounds.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is tinyPod.‚Äù
[00:04:50] ‚ÄúDedicated writing tools
[00:04:51] for the modern writer.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd
[00:04:53] this is a call.‚Äù
[00:04:54] But why does new tech
[00:04:55] so often disguise itself
[00:04:57] in familiar forms?
[00:04:58] The first cars look like
[00:05:00] horseless carriages.
[00:05:01] Early television cabinets
[00:05:02] mimicked radio consoles.
[00:05:04] Even digital cameras today
[00:05:05] include artificial shutter
[00:05:07] sounds to bridge the familiar
[00:05:08] with the new.
[00:05:09] Research shows
[00:05:10] we trust technology more
[00:05:11] when it feels recognizable.
[00:05:13] When Motorola designed
[00:05:14] its first flip phone and borrowed
[00:05:16] directly from Star Trek.
[00:05:17] This wasn't just imitation.
[00:05:19] It was strategic.
[00:05:20] By adopting a familiar form
[00:05:22] from science fiction,
[00:05:23] they made revolutionary technology
[00:05:25] feel accessible to consumers.
[00:05:27] In our world
[00:05:27] of increasingly
[00:05:28] nontraditional interfaces,
[00:05:30] we crave grounded,
[00:05:31] tangible experiences.
[00:05:33] Studies show tactile feedback,
[00:05:35] such as strong
[00:05:35] vibrations, can significantly
[00:05:37] boost user satisfaction.
[00:05:39] These aren't
[00:05:39] just nostalgic touches.
[00:05:41] They're deliberate choices
[00:05:42] to make advanced technology
[00:05:43] feel more satisfying
[00:05:44] and approachable.
[00:05:46] But our imaginations
[00:05:47] aren't as limitless as we think.
[00:05:49] They're wired by the past.
[00:05:50] Our acceptance
[00:05:51] of new technology follows
[00:05:53] what research calls
[00:05:54] the Diffusion of Innovation curve.
[00:05:56] Revolutionary ideas, rarely gain
[00:05:58] immediate widespread adoption.
[00:06:00] Instead, they spread gradually
[00:06:02] through society as people
[00:06:03] become more comfortable with them.
[00:06:18] Industrial designer
[00:06:19] Raymond Loewy captured
[00:06:20] this principle
[00:06:21] in what he called M.A.Y.A.
[00:06:22] Most advanced, yet acceptable.
[00:06:24] ‚ÄúOf course, to do all this,
[00:06:26] you will have to learn
[00:06:27] to do this.‚Äù
[00:06:28] For innovations to succeed,
[00:06:30] they need to be
[00:06:31] groundbreaking, yet
[00:06:32] familiar enough
[00:06:32] to feel trustworthy.
[00:06:34] It's a balance
[00:06:34] between pushing boundaries
[00:06:36] and keeping recognizable elements
[00:06:38] that make new designs
[00:06:39] feel comfortable.
[00:06:40] When this balance is off,
[00:06:41] even promising
[00:06:42] technology can fail.
[00:06:43] Over a decade after Google Glass,
[00:06:45] its failure highlights
[00:06:46] what happens
[00:06:47] when tech misses the mark.
[00:06:49] While innovative,
[00:06:49] it struggled with short
[00:06:50] battery life,
[00:06:51] poor voice
[00:06:52] controls, and a design
[00:06:53] that felt socially intrusive.
[00:06:55] ‚ÄúOkay Glass,
[00:06:56] take a picture.‚Äù
[00:06:57] It failed to resonate
[00:06:58] with consumers
[00:06:59] on a practical
[00:06:59] and emotional level,
[00:07:01] leaving many feeling unprepared
[00:07:02] for this vision of the future.
[00:07:04] The balance of acceptance
[00:07:05] also shifts across generations.
[00:07:08] ‚ÄúWe can't overestimate
[00:07:09] the value of computers.
[00:07:11] Yes, they are great
[00:07:12] for playing games
[00:07:13] and forwarding funny emails.
[00:07:16] But real business
[00:07:17] is done on paper. Okay.
[00:07:21] Write that down.‚Äù
[00:07:23] Research shows
[00:07:23] that early experiences
[00:07:25] with technology
[00:07:25] during formative years,
[00:07:27] typically ages 15 to 25, shape
[00:07:29] what sociologists call ‚ÄúTechnology
[00:07:31] Generations‚Äù Groups
[00:07:32] defined by shared exposure
[00:07:34] to key innovations
[00:07:35] that emerged during their youth.
[00:07:38] technology generations
[00:07:40] are defined by exposure
[00:07:41] to specific technologies
[00:07:43] rather than age alone.
[00:07:44] If you were one of those people
[00:07:46] who had a brick-like cell phone,
[00:07:48] you may view constant connection
[00:07:49] differently than those introduced
[00:07:51] to smartphones
[00:07:52] with social media built
[00:07:53] in. These generational differences
[00:07:55] reflect how
[00:07:56] foundational technologies
[00:07:57] can shape habits,
[00:07:58] ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù
[00:08:00] attitudes, ‚ÄúEverybody likes
[00:08:02] new inventions, new technology.
[00:08:04] Computers are about trying
[00:08:06] to murder you in a lake.‚Äù
[00:08:07] and even the way
[00:08:08] someone approaches
[00:08:09] newer innovations
[00:08:10] throughout their life. ‚ÄúErase!
[00:08:12] Erase all pictures of Ron!
[00:08:14] Erase all pictures of Ron!
[00:08:17] The world is a nightmare.‚Äù
[00:08:28] ‚ÄúMike, would you
[00:08:31] make me a dupe of that?
[00:08:32] I'd like to show it
[00:08:32] to some friends of ours
[00:08:33] who spend a lot of time
[00:08:34] down there.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure.
[00:08:35] What I guess
[00:08:35] you want in 3D.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah
[00:08:36] we finally made the switch.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou
[00:08:38] got to keep up with the times,
[00:08:39] you know?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, but...‚Äù
[00:08:41] ‚ÄúBut what?‚Äù
[00:08:42] ‚ÄúWell, there's 3D and 4D...
[00:08:44] you know...
[00:08:45] what's next?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat's next?
[00:08:48] You never know.
[00:08:49] You never really know.‚Äù
[00:08:52] So why do imagined futures often
[00:08:54] look like the past?
[00:08:55] It's not that we can't
[00:08:57] imagine bold new futures.
[00:08:58] Echoes of the past
[00:08:59] help us make the future
[00:09:00] feel approachable,
[00:09:02] grounding us in the familiar.
[00:09:04] The futures we envision
[00:09:05] go beyond tools or technologies.
[00:09:07] ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù
[00:09:09] They're expressions of who we are,
[00:09:10] our hopes, fears,
[00:09:12] and dreams
[00:09:12] woven into stories
[00:09:13] that help us navigate uncertainty.
[00:09:16] Yesterday's visions of tomorrow
[00:09:17] weren't about predicting
[00:09:19] the future.
[00:09:19] They were ways of processing
[00:09:21] change, expressing hope
[00:09:23] and making the unknown
[00:09:24] feel a little more familiar.
