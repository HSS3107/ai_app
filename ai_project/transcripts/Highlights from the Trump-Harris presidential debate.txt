Transcript:

[00:00:01] Kamala Harris. Let’s have a good debate. Nice to see you. Have fun.
[00:00:03] Thank you. Thank you.
[00:00:06] Welcome to you both.
[00:00:07] It's wonderful to have you. It's an honor
to have you both here tonight.
[00:00:10] Why do you believe it's appropriate
to weigh in on the racial identity
[00:00:13] of your opponent?
I don't and I don't care.
[00:00:16] I don't care what she is. I don't care.
[00:00:18] You make a big deal out of something.
[00:00:21] I couldn't care less.
[00:00:22] Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.
[00:00:25] But those were your words,
so. I mean, I don't know.
[00:00:26] I don't know, I mean, all I can say is
I read where she was not Black
[00:00:31] that she put out, and I'll say that.
[00:00:34] And then I read that she was Black,
and that's okay.
[00:00:37] Either one was okay with me.
That's up to her.
[00:00:40] That's up to her.
[00:00:41] I mean, honestly,
I think it's a tragedy that we have
[00:00:45] someone who wants to be president
who has consistently,
[00:00:49] over the course of his career,
[00:00:52] attempted to use race to divide
the American people.
[00:00:56] You know, I do believe that the vast
majority of us know that we have so much
[00:00:59] more in common than what separates us,
and we don't want this kind of approach
[00:01:03] that is just constantly trying to divide
us, and especially by race.
[00:01:07] Everything that she believed three years
ago and four years ago is out the window.
[00:01:12] She's going to my philosophy now.
[00:01:14] In fact,
I was going to send her a MAGA hat.
[00:01:16] She's gone to my philosophy, but
if she ever got elected, she'd change it.
[00:01:20] And it will be the end of our country.
[00:01:23] She's a Marxist.
[00:01:24] Everybody knows she's a Marxist.
[00:01:26] Her father's a Marxist professor
in economics, and he taught her well.
[00:01:31] She gave up at least 12 and probably 14
or 15 different policies.
[00:01:35] Like, she was big on defund
the police. In Minnesota,
[00:01:39] she went out —
[00:01:40] Wait a minute.
[00:01:40] I'm talking now,
if you don't mind, please.
[00:01:44] Does that sound familiar?
[00:01:46] They have abortion in the ninth month.
[00:01:50] They even have —
[00:01:50] and you can look at the governor
of West Virginia, the previous governor
[00:01:54] of West Virginia, not the current
governor, is doing an excellent job.
[00:01:57] But the governor before,
he said the baby will be born
[00:02:01] and we will decide
what to do with the baby.
[00:02:03] In other words, we’ll execute the baby.
[00:02:05] There is no state in this country
where it is
[00:02:07] legal to kill a baby after it's born.
[00:02:09] Donald Trump hand-selected three members
of the United States Supreme Court
[00:02:14] with the intention that they would undo
the protections of Roe v Wade,
[00:02:18] and they did exactly as he intended.
[00:02:21] And now, in over 20 states,
there are Trump abortion bans
[00:02:26] which make it criminal for a doctor or
nurse to provide health care. In one state
[00:02:32] it provides prison for life.
[00:02:35] Trump abortion bans that make
[00:02:36] no exception even for rape and incest,
which understand what that means.
[00:02:41] A survivor of a crime,
a violation to their body,
[00:02:45] does not have the right to make a decision
about what happens to their body next.
[00:02:49] That is immoral.
[00:02:51] And I pledge to you, when Congress passes
a bill to put back in place
[00:02:56] the protections of Roe v Wade,
as President of the United States,
[00:03:00] I will proudly sign it into law.
[00:03:03] But understand,
[00:03:05] if Donald Trump were to be reelected,
he will sign a national abortion ban.
[00:03:09] It's a lie.
[00:03:10] I'm not signing a ban,
and there's no reason to sign a ban
[00:03:13] because we've gotten
what everybody wanted.
[00:03:16] Democrats, Republicans, and everybody else.
[00:03:19] And every legal scholar wanted it
to be brought back into the states.
[00:03:23] And the states are voting. And it may take
a little time, but for 52 years
[00:03:29] this issue has torn our country apart,
and they've wanted it back in the states.
[00:03:34] And I did something
that nobody thought was possible.
[00:03:38] The states are now voting.
[00:03:40] What she says is an absolute lie.
[00:03:42] And as far as the abortion ban,
no, I'm not in favor of abortion.
[00:03:46] But it doesn't matter because this issue
has now been taken over by the states.
[00:03:51] Would you support any restrictions
on a woman's right to an abortion?
[00:03:55] I absolutely support
reinstating the protections of Roe v Wade.
[00:03:59] And as you rightly mentioned,
nowhere in America
[00:04:04] is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term
[00:04:08] and, and is asking for an abortion.
That is not happening.
[00:04:12] It's insulting to the women of America.
What we will do
[00:04:16] is we're looking at different plans.
[00:04:18] If we can come up with a plan
that's going to cost our people,
[00:04:21] our population, less money
and be better health care than Obamacare,
[00:04:26] then I would absolutely do it.
[00:04:28] But until then, I'd run it
as good as it can be. run.
[00:04:31] So just a
yes or no? You still do not have a plan.
[00:04:34] I have concepts of a plan.
[00:04:36] I'm not president right now, but if
[00:04:39] we come
up with something, I would only change it.
[00:04:42] If we come up with something
that's better and less expensive,
[00:04:45] and there are concepts and options,
[00:04:47] we have to do that.
[00:04:49] And you'll be hearing about it
in the not too distant future.
[00:04:52] I'm going to actually do something really
unusual, and I'm going to invite you
[00:04:56] to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies,
because it's a really interesting thing
[00:04:59] to watch.
[00:05:00] You will see, during the course
of his rallies,
[00:05:03] he talks about fictional characters
like Hannibal Lecter.
[00:05:06] He will talk about windmills,
cause cancer.
[00:05:09] And what you will also notice is that
people start leaving his rallies early
[00:05:13] out of exhaustion and boredom.
[00:05:16] And I will tell you the one thing
[00:05:17] you will not hear him talk about is you.
[00:05:19] You will not hear him
[00:05:20] talk about your needs, your dreams,
and your needs, and your desires.
[00:05:24] And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve
a president who actually puts you first.
[00:05:29] And I pledge to you that I will.
[00:05:31] We have the biggest rallies,
the most incredible
[00:05:33] rallies in the history of politics.
[00:05:35] That's because people
want to take their country back.
[00:05:38] Our country is being lost.
[00:05:39] We're failing nation.
[00:05:41] In Springfield, they're eating the dogs.
[00:05:44] The people that came
in, they're eating the cats.
[00:05:47] They're eating, they're eating the pets
of the people that live there.
[00:05:53] And this is
what's happening in our country.
[00:05:55] And it's a shame.
I just want to clarify here,
[00:05:58] you bring up Springfield,
Ohio, and ABC News
[00:06:01] did reach out to the city manager there.
[00:06:02] He told us there had been no credible
reports of specific claims of pets being
[00:06:06] harmed, injured, or abused by individuals
within the immigrant community.
[00:06:10] Crime here is up and through the roof.
[00:06:13] Despite their fraudulent statements
that they made,
[00:06:15] crime in this country is through the roof.
[00:06:18] And we have a new form of crime.
[00:06:19] It's called migrant crime.
[00:06:21] And it's happening at levels
that nobody thought possible.
[00:06:23] President Trump,
as you know, the FBI says overall
[00:06:26] violent crime
is actually coming down in this country.
[00:06:28] Well, I think this is so rich coming
from someone who has been prosecuted
[00:06:34] for national security
[00:06:36] crimes, economic crimes, election
interference,
[00:06:41] has been found liable for sexual assault.
[00:06:44] And his next big court appearance is in
November at his own criminal sentencing.
[00:06:50] I understand
this is someone who has openly said
[00:06:53] he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate
the Constitution of the United States,
[00:06:58] that he would weaponize the Department
of Justice against his political enemies.
[00:07:04] This is the one that weaponized, not me.
[00:07:06] She weaponized.
[00:07:07] I probably took a bullet to the head
because of the things
[00:07:11] that they say about me.
[00:07:13] They talk about democracy.
[00:07:15] I'm a threat to democracy.
[00:07:16] They're the threat to democracy.
[00:07:19] In the past couple of weeks
leading up to this debate,
[00:07:21] you have said, “you lost by a whisker,” that you, 
[00:07:24] “didn't quite make it,”
that you came up a little bit short.
[00:07:27] I said that?
[00:07:28] Are you now
acknowledging that you lost in 2020?
[00:07:31] No. I didn’t acknowledge that at all.
I did that sarcastically.
[00:07:33] You know that. It was said, oh,
we lost by a whisker.
[00:07:36] That was said sarcastically.
Vice President Harris,
[00:07:38] you heard the president there tonight.
[00:07:40] He said he didn't say that, that
he lost by a whisker.
[00:07:41] So he still believes
he did not lose the election
[00:07:45] that was won by President Biden,
and yourself.
[00:07:49] But I do want to ask you about something
that's come up in the last couple of days.
[00:07:52] This was a post
[00:07:52] from, President Trump about this upcoming
election, just weeks away.
[00:07:56] He said,
when I win, those people who cheated —
[00:07:59] and then he lists donors, voters, election
officials — he says, will be prosecuted
[00:08:03] to the fullest extent of the law, which
will include long term prison sentences.
[00:08:07] One of your campaign's
[00:08:08] top lawyers responded, saying,
we won't let Donald Trump intimidate us.
[00:08:11] We won't let him suppress the vote.
[00:08:14] Is that what you believe
he's trying to do here?
[00:08:17] Donald
Trump was fired by 81 million people.
[00:08:21] So let's be clear about that.
[00:08:22] And clearly he is having a very difficult
time processing that.
