[00:00:00] WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS.
[00:00:03] >> Bret: MADAM VICE PRESIDENT,
[00:00:04] THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.
[00:00:05] >> THANK YOU.
[00:00:05] IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, BRET.
[00:00:08] >> Bret: VOTERS TELL POLLSTERS
[00:00:09] ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND HERE IN
[00:00:11] PENNSYLVANIA IMMIGRATION IS ONE
[00:00:12] OF THE KEY ISSUES THEY ARE
[00:00:13] LOOKING AT THIS ELECTION.
[00:00:15] SPECIFICALLY THE INFLUX OF
[00:00:16] ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM MORE
[00:00:18] THAN 150 COUNTRIES.
[00:00:19] HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
[00:00:22] WOULD YOU ESTIMATE YOUR
[00:00:23] ADMINISTRATION HAS RELEASED INTO
[00:00:25] THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST THREE
[00:00:26] AND A HALF YEARS?
[00:00:28] >> WELL, I'M GLAD YOU RAISED THE
[00:00:29] ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION BECAUSE I
[00:00:31] AGREE WITH YOU, IT IS A -- IT IS
[00:00:33] A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION THAT
[00:00:34] PEOPLE WANT TO RIGHTLY HAVE.
[00:00:37] AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO
[00:00:38] TALK ABOUT.
[00:00:39] >> Bret: JUST A NUMBER.
[00:00:40] DO YOU THINK IT'S 1 MILLION?
[00:00:42] 3 MILLION?
[00:00:42] >> BRET, LET'S JUST GET TO THE
[00:00:44] POINTED, OKAY?
[00:00:45] THE POINT IS THAT WE HAVE A
[00:00:47] BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT
[00:00:48] NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED.
[00:00:50] >>
[00:00:51] >> Bret: SO YOUR HOMELAND
[00:00:52] SECURITY SECRETARY SAID 85% OF
[00:00:54] APPREHENSIONS.
[00:00:54] >> I'M NOT FINISHED.
[00:00:57] >> Bret: IT'S A ROUGH ESTIMATE
[00:00:58] OF 6 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
[00:00:59] RELEASED INTO THE COUNTRY.
[00:01:00] LET ME JUST FINISH AND I WILL
[00:01:01] GET YOU THE QUESTION, I PROMISE
[00:01:03] YOU.
[00:01:03] >> I WAS BEGINNING TO ANSWER.
[00:01:05] >> WHEN YOU CAME INTO OFFICE
[00:01:07] YOUR ADMINISTRATION IMMEDIATELY
[00:01:08] REVERSED A NUMBER OF TRUMP
[00:01:09] BORDER POLICIES.
[00:01:10] MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE POLICY
[00:01:12] THAT REQUIRED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
[00:01:13] TO BE DETAINED THROUGH
[00:01:15] DEPORTATION EITHER IN THE U.S.
[00:01:17] OR IN MEXICO.
[00:01:18] AND YOU SWITCHED THAT POLICY.
[00:01:19] THEY WERE RELEASED FROM CUSTODY
[00:01:22] AWAITING TRIAL.
[00:01:24] SO, INSTEAD INCLUDED IN THOSE
[00:01:25] WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF SINGLE
[00:01:27] MEN, ADULT MEN WHO WENT ON TO
[00:01:29] COMMIT HEINOUS CRIMES.
[00:01:31] SO, LOOKING BACK, DO YOU REGRET
[00:01:34] THE DECISION TO TERMINATE REMAIN
[00:01:36] IN MEXICO AT THE BEGINNING OF
[00:01:37] YOUR ADMINISTRATION?
[00:01:38] >> AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR
[00:01:41] ADMINISTRATION, WITHIN
[00:01:42] PRACTICALLY HOURS OF TAKING THE
[00:01:46] OATH, THE FIRST BILL THAT WE
[00:01:49] OFFERED CONGRESS BEFORE WE
[00:01:51] WORKED ON INFRASTRUCTURE, BEFORE
[00:01:54] THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT,
[00:01:55] BEFORE THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE
[00:01:57] ACT, BEFORE ANY -- BEFORE THE
[00:02:00] BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES
[00:02:03] ACT, THE FIRST BILL PRACTICALLY
[00:02:04] WITHIN HOURS OF TAKING THE OATH
[00:02:06] WAS A BILL TO FIX OUR
[00:02:08] IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.
[00:02:09] >> YEMEN, IT WAS CALLED THE U.S.
[00:02:11] CITIZENSHIP ACT OF 2021.
[00:02:13] >> EXACTLY.
[00:02:14] >> IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A PATHWAY
[00:02:16] TO CITIZENSHIP.
[00:02:16] >> MAY I PLEASE FINISH MAY I
[00:02:19] FINISH RESPONDING PLEASE?
[00:02:20] YOU HAVE TO LET ME FINISH
[00:02:22] PLEASE.
[00:02:22] >> YOU HAD THE WHITE HOUSE, THE
[00:02:23] HOUSE AND THE SENATE.
[00:02:25] >> I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF
[00:02:26] RESPONDING TO THE POINTED YOU
[00:02:27] ARE RAISING.
[00:02:27] >> OKAY.
[00:02:28] >> I WOULD LIKE TO FINISH.
[00:02:31] >> Bret: YEMEN.
[00:02:31] >> WE RECOGNIZED FROM DAY ONE
[00:02:34] THAT TO THE POINT OF THIS BEING
[00:02:36] YOUR FIRST QUESTION, IT IS A
[00:02:39] PRIORITY FOR US AS A NATION AND
[00:02:41] FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR
[00:02:43] FOCUS HAS BEEN ON FIXING A
[00:02:46] PROBLEM AND FROM DAY ONE THEN,
[00:02:47] WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS,
[00:02:51] INCLUDING TO ADDRESS OUR ASYLUM
[00:02:53] SYSTEM AND PORT MORE RESOURCES,
[00:02:55] GETTING MORE JUDGES, WHAT WE
[00:02:56] NEEDED TO DO TO TIGHTEN UP
[00:02:58] PENALTIES AND INCREASE PENALTIES
[00:03:00] FOR ILLEGAL CROSSINGS.
[00:03:01] WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO DEAL
[00:03:03] WITH PORTS -- POINTS OF ENTRY
[00:03:07] BETWEEN BORDER ENTRY POINTS.
[00:03:08] THAT'S THE WORK WE DID AND WE
[00:03:11] WORKED ON SUPPORTING WHAT WAS A
[00:03:14] BIPARTISAN EFFORT INCLUDING SOME
[00:03:15] OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS
[00:03:17] OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO
[00:03:19] ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN THE BORDER.
[00:03:21] THAT BORDER BILL WOULD HAVE PUT
[00:03:24] 1500 MORE BORDER AGENTS AT THE
[00:03:25] BORDER WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE
[00:03:27] THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS
[00:03:28] SUPPORTED THE BILL.
[00:03:29] IT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO STEM
[00:03:30] THE FLOW OF FENTANYL COMING INTO
[00:03:32] THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS A
[00:03:34] SCOURGE AFFECTING PEOPLE OF
[00:03:36] EVERY BACKGROUND EVERY
[00:03:37] GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION IN OUR
[00:03:38] COUNTRY, KILLING PEOPLE IT.
[00:03:40] WOULD HAVE ALLOWED TO US PUT
[00:03:41] MORE RESOURCES NO PROSECUTING
[00:03:45] TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINALS WHICH I
[00:03:47] HAVE DONE.
[00:03:48] >> Bret: YEMEN.
[00:03:48] >> FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
[00:03:49] THE BORDER STATE PROSECUTED
[00:03:51] TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS AND HUMAN
[00:03:53] BEINGS AND DONALD TRUMP BRET LET
[00:03:55] ME JUST FIN.
[00:03:57] >> Bret: SIX DEMOCRATS VOTED
[00:03:57] AGAINST THAT BILL.
[00:03:58] >> DONALD TRUMP LEARNED ABOUT
[00:03:59] THAT BILL AND TOLD THEM TO KILL
[00:04:01] IT BECAUSE HE PREFERRED A RUN ON
[00:04:02] A PROBLEM INSTEAD OF FIXING A
[00:04:04] PROBLEM AND IN THIS ELECTION,
[00:04:06] WHICH IS RIGHTLY A DISCUSSION
[00:04:09] THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO
[00:04:11] HAVE AND WHAT THEY WANT ARE
[00:04:12] SOLUTIONS AND THEY WANT A
[00:04:14] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
[00:04:15] WHO IS NOT PLAYING POLITICAL
[00:04:17] GAMES WITH THE ISSUE.
[00:04:18] >> Bret: I HEAR YOU.
[00:04:20] >> ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON FIXING
[00:04:21] IT.
[00:04:22] >> SIX DEMOCRATS A ALLOWED
[00:04:25] 1.8 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
[00:04:26] INTO THE COUNTRY A YEAR.
[00:04:27] A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES HAD A
[00:04:28] PROBLEM WITH IT.
[00:04:29] THESE ARE THE SIX DEMOCRATS.
[00:04:30] BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, BACK TO
[00:04:31] THE ORIGINAL PREMISE.
[00:04:34] JOCELYN YOU THINK GATHER, RACHEL
[00:04:37] MORIN, LAKEN RILEY, YOUNG WOMEN
[00:04:40] BRUTALLY ASSAULTED AND KILLED BY
[00:04:41] SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE
[00:04:42] RELEASED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
[00:04:44] ADMINISTRATION.
[00:04:44] WELL BEFORE A NEGOTIATED
[00:04:46] BIPARTISAN BILL.
[00:04:48] FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON
[00:04:48] ACTUALLY REFERRED TO LAKEN RILEY
[00:04:50] SUNDAY, CAMPAIGNING FOR YOU IN
[00:04:51] GEORGIA SAYING IF THOSE MEN HAD
[00:04:53] BEEN PROPERLY VETTED, LAKEN
[00:04:54] RILEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE
[00:04:55] BEEN KILLED.
[00:04:56] SO, IF IT WOULDN'T HAVE
[00:04:58] HAPPENED, THIS IS WELL BEFORE
[00:05:01] ANY NEGOTIATION, THIS IS WELL
[00:05:02] BEFORE DONALD TRUMP GOT INVOLVED
[00:05:03] IN THE POLITICS, THIS IS A
[00:05:05] SPECIFIC POLICY DECISION BY YOUR
[00:05:07] ADMINISTRATION TO RELEASE THESE
[00:05:08] MEN INTO THE COUNTRY, SO WHAT
[00:05:10] I'M SAYING TO YOU DO YOU.
[00:05:12] >> I THINK IT'S REALLY.
[00:05:14] >> OWE THOSE FAMILIES AN
[00:05:15] APOLOGY?
[00:05:16] >> LET ME JUST SAY FIRST OF ALL,
[00:05:17] THOSE ARE TRAGIC CASES.
[00:05:19] THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
[00:05:21] THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
[00:05:23] AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THE PAIN
[00:05:26] THAT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE
[00:05:28] VICTIMS HAVE EXPERIENCED.
[00:05:30] FOR A LOSS THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE
[00:05:33] OCCURRED.
[00:05:36] SO, THAT IS TRUE.
[00:05:37] IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT IF A BORDER
[00:05:40] SECURITY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN
[00:05:41] PASSED NINE MONTHS AGO, IT WOULD
[00:05:44] BE NINE MONTHS THAT WE WOULD
[00:05:46] HAVE HAD MORE BORDER AGENTS AT
[00:05:49] THE BORDER, MORE SUPPORT FOR THE
[00:05:51] FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING AROUND THE
[00:05:53] CLOCK TRYING TO HOLD IT ALL
[00:05:55] TOGETHER.
[00:05:56] >> Bret: MADAM VICE PRESIDENT --
[00:05:57] >> -- TO ENSURE THAT NO FUTURE
[00:05:59] HARM WOULD OCCUR.
[00:06:00] AND THIS ELECTION IN 20 DAYS,
[00:06:03] WILL DETERMINE WHETHER WE HAVE A
[00:06:05] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
[00:06:06] WHO ACTUALLY CARES MORE ABOUT
[00:06:09] FIXING A PROBLEM EVEN IF IT IS
[00:06:10] NOT TO THEIR POLITICAL ADVANTAGE
[00:06:12] IN AN ELECTION.
[00:06:13] BECAUSE THERE WAS A SOLUTION,
[00:06:16] BRET.
[00:06:17] >> Bret: MADAM VICE PRESIDENT IT
[00:06:18] WAS A POLICY DECISION IN THE
[00:06:18] EARLY PART OF YOUR
[00:06:19] ADMINISTRATION.
[00:06:20] I WILL LET ONE OF THE MOTHERS
[00:06:22] TALK ABOUT IT.
[00:06:22] TAKE A LISTEN.
[00:06:25] >> BECAUSE OF THE BIDEN-HARRIS
[00:06:27] ADMINISTRATION OPEN BORDER
[00:06:29] POLICIES CATCH AND RELEASE, THEY
[00:06:30] WERE ENROLLED IN THE
[00:06:31] ALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION
[00:06:33] PROGRAM.
[00:06:34] THIS MEANT THAT THEY WERE
[00:06:34] RELEASED INTO THE UNITED STATES.
[00:06:36] IT WAS NOT EVEN A FULL THREE
[00:06:38] WEEKS LATER THAT THEY WOULD TAKE
[00:06:40] MY DAUGHTER, JOCELYN YOU THINK
[00:06:41] GATHER'S LIFE.
[00:06:43] I BELIEVE THE BIDEN-HARRIS
[00:06:48] ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBLE FOR
[00:06:52] THE DEATH OF MY DAUGHTER.
[00:06:53] >> THAT'S THE EARLY DAYS ARE
[00:06:56] YOU.
[00:06:56] >> I'M SO SORRY FOR HER LOSS.
[00:06:57] I'M SO SORRY FOR HER LOSS.
[00:07:00] SINCERELY.
[00:07:01] BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS
[00:07:04] HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH AN
[00:07:07] INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT WANT TO
[00:07:08] PARTICIPATE IN SOLUTIONS LET'S
[00:07:11] TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL.
[00:07:12] >> DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER HER?
[00:07:14] >> I TOLD YOU I FEEL AWFUL FOR
[00:07:16] WHAT SHE AND HER FAMILY HAVE
[00:07:18] EXPERIENCED.
[00:07:19] >> DURING THAT TIME YOU SAID
[00:07:20] REPEATEDLY THAT THE BORDER WAS
[00:07:25] SECURE WHEN IN YOUR MIND DID IT
[00:07:27] START GOING A CRISIS.
[00:07:27] >> WE HAVE HAD A BROKEN BORDER
[00:07:32] SYSTEM TRAPPED SENDING EVEN
[00:07:34] BEFORE.
[00:07:34] EVEN BEFORE.
[00:07:35] LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT.
[00:07:36] I HAVE NO PRIDE IN SAYING THIS
[00:07:38] IS A PERFECT IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.
[00:07:39] I HAVE BEEN CLEAR, I THINK WE
[00:07:43] ALL ARE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE
[00:07:44] FIXED.
[00:07:45] WE NEED MORE -- I WAS JUST DOWN
[00:07:46] AT THE BORDER TALKING WITH
[00:07:48] BORDER AGENTS.
[00:07:48] AND THEY WILL TELL YOU AND I'M
[00:07:50] SURE YOU PROBABLY -- I KNOW YOU
[00:07:51] INVESTIGATE AND YOU ARE A
[00:07:53] SERIOUS JOURNALIST, THEY WILL
[00:07:54] TELL YOU WE NEED MORE JUDGES.
[00:07:57] WE NEED TO -- WE NEED TO PROCESS
[00:07:59] THOSE CASES FASTER.
[00:08:00] WE NEED THE SUPPORT FOR THOSE
[00:08:02] CASES THAT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED.
[00:08:05] THEY NEED MORE RESOURCES.
[00:08:07] AND CONGRESS ULTIMATELY IS THE
[00:08:08] ONLY PLACE THAT THAT'S GOING TO
[00:08:10] GET FIXED, BRET.
[00:08:11] THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS.
[00:08:13] >> Bret: THAT'S THE PREMISE OF
[00:08:14] THIS QUESTION.
[00:08:15] THERE WERE 90 PLUS EXECUTIVE
[00:08:17] ORDERS RESCINDED IN THE FIRST
[00:08:18] DAYS.
[00:08:19] MANY OF THOSE WERE TRUMP BORDER
[00:08:22] POLICIES.
[00:08:22] I'M NOT GOING TO STAY HERE
[00:08:23] BECAUSE THERE IS OTHER THINGS TO
[00:08:24] TALK ABOUT.
[00:08:25] BUT YOU FREQUENTLY TALK TO THE
[00:08:26] BORDER PATROL UNION FOR SUPPORT
[00:08:27] OF THAT BIPARTISAN BILL AND THEY
[00:08:29] DID.
[00:08:29] THEY SUPPORTED IT.
[00:08:30] BUT THEY ALSO JUST ENDORSED
[00:08:31] DONALD TRUMP AND SAID YOU HAVE
[00:08:33] BEEN, QUOTE, A FAILURE WITH
[00:08:34] BORDER SECURITY.
[00:08:35] WHY DO YOU THINK THEY SAID THAT?
[00:08:36] >> I THINK THEY ARE FRUSTRATED.
[00:08:39] AND I GET IT.
[00:08:41] THEY WANT SUPPORT.
[00:08:43] THEY WANT SUPPORT AND THAT'S
[00:08:43] WHAT THAT BORDER SECURITY BILL
[00:08:45] WOULD HAVE DONE.
[00:08:46] THESE GUYS DOWN AT THE BORDER,
[00:08:47] THESE MEN AND WOMEN, THEY ARE
[00:08:49] WORKING HARD.
[00:08:49] THEY ARE WORKING AROUND THE
[00:08:52] CLOCK.
[00:08:53] I GET IT.
[00:08:55] >> Bret: THERE IS A LOT OF
[00:08:56] PEOPLE LOOK BACK WHAT YOU SAID
[00:08:58] 2019 WHEN YOU FIRST RAN FOR
[00:08:59] PRESIDENT.
[00:08:59] AND THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES AND
[00:09:00] YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THEM.
[00:09:01] WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION,
[00:09:03] YOU SUPPORTED ALLOWING
[00:09:04] IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY
[00:09:05] ILLEGALLY TO APPLY FOR DRIVERS
[00:09:07] LICENSES TO QUALIFY FOR FREE
[00:09:09] TUITION AT UNIVERSITIES, TO BE
[00:09:11] ENROLLED IN FREE HEALTHCARE.
[00:09:12] DO YOU STILL SUPPORT THOSE
[00:09:14] THINGS?
[00:09:14] >> LISTEN, THAT WAS FIVE YEARS
[00:09:15] AGO.
[00:09:16] AND I'M VERY CLEAR THAT I WILL
[00:09:17] FOLLOW THE LAW.
[00:09:19] I HAVE MADE THAT STATEMENT OVER
[00:09:20] AND OVER AGAIN.
[00:09:21] AND AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE
[00:09:22] UNITED STATES THAT'S EXACTLY
[00:09:23] WHAT I HAVE DONE.
[00:09:24] NOT TO MENTION BEFORE.
[00:09:25] >> Bret: DID THAT'S THE CASE,
[00:09:27] YOU CHOSE A RUNNING MATE, TIM
[00:09:29] WALZ GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA, WHO
[00:09:30] SIGNED THOSE VERY THINGS INTO
[00:09:32] STATE LAW.
[00:09:33] SO DO YOU SUPPORT THAT?
[00:09:37] >> WE ARE VERY CLEAR AND I AM
[00:09:40] VERY CLEAR AS IS TIM WALZ THAT
[00:09:43] WE MUST SUPPORT AND ENFORCE
[00:09:45] FEDERAL LAW AND THAT IS EXACTLY
[00:09:47] WHAT WE WILL DO.
[00:09:49] >> Bret: SO DECRIMINALIZING
[00:09:50] BORDER CROSSINGS LIKE YOU SAID
[00:09:52] IN 2019 --
[00:09:53] >> -- I DO NOT BELIEVE IN
[00:09:55] DECRIMINALIZING BORDER
[00:09:56] CROSSINGS.
[00:09:56] AND I HAVE NOT DONE THAT AS VICE
[00:09:58] PRESIDENT.
[00:09:58] I WILL NOT DO THAT AS PRESIDENT.
[00:10:01] >> Bret: SO THESE ARE E. LUCIENS
[00:10:03] THAT YOU HAVE HAD.
[00:10:04] >> LET'S BE VERY CLEAR I'M THE
[00:10:06] ONLY PERSON RUNNING FOR
[00:10:07] PRESIDENT WHO HAS PROSECUTED
[00:10:10] TRANS NARBLED CRIMINAL FROM THE
[00:10:13] SINALOA FROM GRAD LA HARRAHS
[00:10:16] CARTEL PEOPLE TRAFFICKED IN
[00:10:17] GUNS, DRUGS AND HUMAN BEINGS.
[00:10:19] I HAVE SPENT A SIGNIFICANT PART
[00:10:20] OF MY CAREER GOING AFTER PEOPLE
[00:10:24] WHO PRESENT A THREAT TO THE
[00:10:26] SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
[00:10:27] AND IN CROSS OUR BORDER IN
[00:10:32] INTENT OF DOING US HARM AND.
[00:10:35] I WILL DO IT AS VICE PRESIDENT.
[00:10:37] I TAKE THAT WORK QUITE SEAR
[00:10:39] USELY.
[00:10:40] >> Bret: THIS IS A TIME WHEN
[00:10:41] VOTERS ESPECIALLY IN
[00:10:43] PENNSYLVANIA INUNDATED WITH
[00:10:43] COMMERCIALS AND ADS.
[00:10:44] THEY WANT IT TO STOP BECAUSE
[00:10:46] IT'S EVERY COMMERCIAL.
[00:10:47] EVERY OF THEM ADD NOISE.
[00:10:49] FEW OF THEM SEEM TO
[00:10:51] BREAKTHROUGH.
[00:10:51] THIS PARTICULAR ONE FROM THE
[00:10:53] TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS GOTTEN A LOT
[00:10:55] OF ATTENTION.
[00:10:56] >> KAMALA SUPPORTS TAXPAYER
[00:10:59] FUNDED SEX CHANGES FOR PRISONS.
[00:11:00] >> SURGERY.
[00:11:01] >> FOR PRISONERS?
[00:11:02] >> FOR PRISONERS.
[00:11:04] EVERY TRANSGENDER INMATE IN THE
[00:11:05] PRISON SYSTEM WOULD HAVE ACCESS.
[00:11:11] >> Bret: ARE YOU STILL IN
[00:11:12] SUPPORT OF USING TAXPAYER
[00:11:15] DOLLARS TO ILLEGAL ALIENS ON
[00:11:19] INMATES TO TRANSGENDER.
[00:11:20] >> I WILL FOLLOW A LAW.
[00:11:21] A LAW THAT DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY
[00:11:23] FOLLOWED.
[00:11:24] YOUR PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH NOW
[00:11:25] IT'S A PUBLIC REPORT THAT UNDER
[00:11:26] DONALD TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION,
[00:11:29] THESE SURGERIES WERE AVAILABLE
[00:11:32] TO ON A MEDICAL NECESSITY BASIS
[00:11:35] TO PEOPLE IN THE FEDERAL PRISON
[00:11:37] SYSTEM.
[00:11:38] AND I THINK, FRANKLY, THAT AD
[00:11:40] FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS A
[00:11:41] LITTLE BIT OF LIKE THROWING, YOU
[00:11:43] KNOW, STONES WHEN YOU ARE LIVING
[00:11:44] IN A GLASS HOUSE.
[00:11:46] >> Bret: THE TRUMP AIDES SAY HE
[00:11:47] NEVER ADVOCATED FOR THAT PRISON
[00:11:50] POLICY AND NO TRANSGENDER
[00:11:52] HAPPENED DURING HIS
[00:11:54] ADMINISTRATION.
[00:11:54] NO SURGERIES HAPPENED IN HIS
[00:11:56] PRESIDENCY, SO WOULD YOU STILL
[00:11:57] ADVOCATE FOR USING TAXPAYER
[00:11:59] DOLLARS FOR GENDER REASSIGNMENT
[00:12:01] SURGERIES?
[00:12:01] >> I WILL FOLLOW THE LAW.
[00:12:03] >> Bret: YOU HAVE A SAY.
[00:12:04] >> AS DONALD TRUMP SAY HE DID.
[00:12:05] >> Bret: YOU WOULD HAVE A SAY AS
[00:12:06] PRESIDENT.
[00:12:07] >> LIKE I SAID, I THINK HE SPENT
[00:12:09] $20 MILLION ON THOSE ADS TRYING
[00:12:11] TO CREATE A SENSE OF FEAR IN THE
[00:12:13] VOTERS BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY HAS
[00:12:16] NO PLAN IN THIS ELECTION THAT IS
[00:12:19] ABOUT FOCUSING ON THE NEEDS OF
[00:12:22] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE $20 MILLION
[00:12:28] ON THAT AD ISSUE THAT RELATES TO
[00:12:29] THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT EFFECT
[00:12:31] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
[00:12:32] IT'S REALLY QUITE REMOTE.
[00:12:33] AND, AGAIN, HIS POLICY WAS NO
[00:12:35] DIFFERENT.
[00:12:36] LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE THOUGH.
[00:12:38] >> Bret: THEY SAY IT'S DIFFERENT
[00:12:40] MOVE MOVE ON.
[00:12:41] >> I'M OFFERING A PLAN TO DEAL
[00:12:42] WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
[00:12:43] I'M OFFERING A PLAN TO DEAL WITH
[00:12:45] WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH
[00:12:47] STRENGTHEN SMALL BUSINESSES
[00:12:47] WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF
[00:12:49] AMERICA'S ECONOMY.
[00:12:49] I'M OFFERING A PLAN THAT IS
[00:12:50] ABOUT TAKING CARE OF YOUNG
[00:12:52] PARENTS AND GIVING THEM THE
[00:12:53] SUPPORT THEY NEED.
[00:12:54] MY PLANS FOR THE ECONOMY WILL
[00:12:57] STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY AS HAVE
[00:12:58] BEEN REVIEWED BY 16 NOBEL
[00:13:03] LAWYERS, GOLDMAN SACHS, MOODS
[00:13:05] AND RECENTLY THE "WALL STREET
[00:13:06] JOURNAL" HAVE ALL STUDIED OUR
[00:13:08] PLANS AND INDICATED MY PLANS FOR
[00:13:10] OUR ECONOMY STRENGTHEN OUR
[00:13:11] ECONOMY HIS WOULD MAKE THEM
[00:13:14] WEAKER.
[00:13:15] >> Bret: WHY DO YOU THINK MORE
[00:13:15] PEOPLE SAY.
[00:13:17] >> INVITE RECESSION BY THE
[00:13:18] MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR.
[00:13:19] THOSE ARE THE FACTS.
[00:13:20] >> Bret: WHY DO MORE PEOPLE
[00:13:21] TRUST HIM ON THE ECONOMY THAN
[00:13:22] TRUST YOU?
[00:13:23] >> I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT AN
[00:13:24] ANALYSIS OF OUR PLANS FOR WHAT
[00:13:26] WE WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT OF THE
[00:13:29] UNITED STATES IT HAS BEEN CLEAR
[00:13:31] TO THOSE WHO STUDY AND
[00:13:34] UNDERSTAND HOW COMIC POLICY
[00:13:38] WORKS MOVING FORWARD I BELIEVE
[00:13:39] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY TO
[00:13:41] TURN THE PAGE ON THE
[00:13:42] DIVISIVENESS AND THE TYPE OF
[00:13:43] RHETORIC THAT HAS COME OUT OF
[00:13:44] DONALD TRUMP.
[00:13:45] PEOPLE ARE READY TO CHART A NEW
[00:13:47] WAY FORWARD.
[00:13:47] THEY WANT A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A
[00:13:48] PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND A PLAN
[00:13:50] THAT IS SOUND AND WILL
[00:13:52] STRENGTHEN OUR COUNTRY.
[00:13:54] MY PLAN FOR THE ECONOMY DOZEN
[00:13:57] EXACTLY THAT.
[00:13:58] HIS PLAN WOULD BE, AGAIN, TO
[00:13:59] GIVE TAX CUTS TO BILLIONAIRES
[00:14:01] AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN
[00:14:03] OUR COUNTRY AND BLOW UP OUR
[00:14:05] DEFICIT.
[00:14:05] >> Bret: IT'S INTERESTING YOU
[00:14:06] SAID TURN THE PAGE, MADAM VICE
[00:14:07] PRESIDENT.
[00:14:08] YOU WERE ASKED ON TWO DIFFERENT
[00:14:09] SHOWS LAST WEEK WHAT IF ANYTHING
[00:14:11] YOU WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY THAN
[00:14:12] PRESIDENT BIDEN.
[00:14:12] HERE'S WHAT YOU SAID.
[00:14:13] >> WOULD HAVE YOU DONE SOMETHING
[00:14:15] DIFFERENTLY THAN PRESIDENT BIDEN
[00:14:16] DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS?
[00:14:21] >>
[00:14:21] >> THERE IS NOT A THING THAT
[00:14:22] COMES TO MIND IN TERMS OF -- AND
[00:14:24] I HAVE BEEN A PART OF MOST OF
[00:14:25] THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE HAD
[00:14:28] IMPACT.
[00:14:29] >> UNDER A HARRIS
[00:14:30] ADMINISTRATION, WHAT WOULD THE
[00:14:30] MAJOR CHANGES BE AND WHAT WOULD
[00:14:33] STAY THE SAME?
[00:14:34] >> SURE, WELL, I MEAN I'M
[00:14:35] OBVIOUSLY NOT JOE BIDEN.
[00:14:37] UM.
[00:14:37] >> I NOTICED.
[00:14:38] [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:39] >> THAT WOULD BE ONE CHANGE IN
[00:14:41] TERMS OF.
[00:14:41] [APPLAUSE]
[00:14:42] BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
[00:14:44] TO SAY WITH, YOU KNOW, 28 DAYS
[00:14:46] TO GO I'M NOT DONALD TRUMP.
[00:14:48] >> Bret: SO, YOU'RE NOT JOE
[00:14:49] BIDEN, YOU'RE NOT DONALD TRUMP,
[00:14:50] BUT NOTHING COMES TO MIND THAT
[00:14:52] YOU WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY?
[00:14:53] >> LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, MY
[00:14:55] PRESIDENCY WILL NOT BE A
[00:14:56] CONTINUATION OF JOE BIDEN'S
[00:14:59] PRESIDENCY:  AND, LIKE EVERY NEW
[00:15:00] PRESIDENT THAT COMES IN TO
[00:15:02] OFFICE I WILL BRING MY LIFE
[00:15:06] EXPERIENCES, MY PROFESSIONAL
[00:15:07] EXPERIENCES, AND FRESH AND NEW
[00:15:09] IDEAS.
[00:15:09] I REPRESENT A NEW GENERATION OF
[00:15:12] LEADERSHIP.
[00:15:13] I, FOR EXAMPLE, AM SOMEONE WHO
[00:15:14] HAS NOT SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY
[00:15:16] CAREER IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
[00:15:19] I INVITE IDEAS WHETHER IT BE
[00:15:20] FROM THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE
[00:15:22] SUPPORTING ME WHO WERE JUST ON
[00:15:23] STAGE WITH ME MINUTES AGO, AND
[00:15:26] THE BUSINESS SECTOR, AND OTHERS
[00:15:29] WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE
[00:15:30] DECISIONS THAT I MAKE ABOUT, FOR
[00:15:32] EXAMPLE, MY PLAN FOR INCREASING
[00:15:33] THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING IN AMERICA
[00:15:35] AND BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF
[00:15:38] HOUSING.
[00:15:38] ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF SMALL
[00:15:39] BUSINESSES WHICH IS ABOUT
[00:15:40] WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR
[00:15:42] TO BRING MORE CAPITAL AND ACCESS
[00:15:44] TO CAPITAL TO OUR SMALL BUSINESS
[00:15:46] LEADERS, INCLUDING MY PLAN FOR A
[00:15:50] $25,000 DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE
[00:15:52] FOR FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS AND
[00:15:54] FOR SMALL BUSINESSES EXTENDING
[00:15:55] THE TAX DEDUCTION FROM $5,000 TO
[00:15:58] $50,000.
[00:15:59] >> Bret: WE HAVE HEARD A LOT
[00:16:00] ABOUT THOSE PLANS IN RECENT
[00:16:01] DAYS.
[00:16:02] YOUR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN IS A NEW
[00:16:03] WAY FORWARD AND TIME TO TURN THE
[00:16:05] PAGE.
[00:16:05] YOU HAVE BEEN VICE PRESIDENT FOR
[00:16:06] THREE AND A HALF YEARS, SO, WHAT
[00:16:08] ARE YOU TURNING THE PAGE FROM?
[00:16:11] >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, TURNING
[00:16:12] THE PAGE FROM THE LAST DECADE IN
[00:16:15] WHICH WE HAVE BEEN BURDENED WITH
[00:16:18] THE KIND OF RHETORIC COMING FROM
[00:16:20] DONALD TRUMP THAT HAS BEEN
[00:16:22] DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED TO
[00:16:23] DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY AND HAVE
[00:16:26] AMERICANS LITERALLY POINT
[00:16:27] FINGERS AT EACH OTHER.
[00:16:30] RHETORIC AND AN APPROACH TO
[00:16:31] LEADERSHIP THAT SUGGESTS THAT
[00:16:32] THE STRENGTH OF A LEADER IS
[00:16:34] BASED ON WHO YOU BEAT DOWN
[00:16:35] INSTEAD OF WHAT WE ALL KNOW THE
[00:16:37] STRENGTH OF LEADERSHIP IS BASED
[00:16:38] ON WHO YOU LIFT UP.
[00:16:39] THE STRENGTH OF AN AMERICAN VICE
[00:16:42] PRESIDENT WHICH IS ONE WHO
[00:16:44] UNDERSTANDS THAT THE VAST
[00:16:45] MAJORITY OF US HAVE MORE IN
[00:16:47] COMMON THAN WHAT CELEBRATES US.
[00:16:50] >> Bret: MADAM VICE PRESIDENT
[00:16:51] MORE THAN.
[00:16:51] >> TURNING THE PAGE THAT IS
[00:16:53] ABOUT TURNING THE PAGE ON
[00:16:54] RHETORIC THAT PEOPLE ARE FRANKLY
[00:16:56] EXHAUSTED OF, BRET.
[00:16:57] >> Bret: MORE THAN 70% OF PEOPLE
[00:16:59] TELL THE COUNTRY IS ON THE WRONG
[00:17:00] TRACK.
[00:17:01] THEY SAY THE COUNTRY IS ON THE
[00:17:02] WRONG TRACK.
[00:17:03] IF IT'S ON THE WRONG TRACK, THAT
[00:17:06] TRACK FOLLOWS THREE AND A HALF
[00:17:07] YEARS OF YOU BEING VICE
[00:17:09] PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT BIDEN
[00:17:10] BEING PRESIDENT.
[00:17:11] THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING, 79%
[00:17:14] OF THEM.
[00:17:14] WHY ARE THEY SAYING THAT IF YOU
[00:17:16] ARE TURNING THE PAGE, YOU HAVE
[00:17:17] BEEN IN OFFICE FOR THREE AND A
[00:17:19] HALF YEARS.
[00:17:20] >> AND DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN
[00:17:22] RUNNING FOR OFFICE SINCE.
[00:17:25] >> Bret: YOU HAVE BEEN THE
[00:17:25] PERSON HOLDING THE OFFICE, MADAM
[00:17:27] VICE PRESIDENT.
[00:17:27] >> COME ON, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
[00:17:29] WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[00:17:30] >> Bret: I ACTUALLY DON'T.
[00:17:31] WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[00:17:32] >> WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS
[00:17:33] THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE.
[00:17:36] >> Bret: YOU HAVE THE LEVER OF
[00:17:38] POWER.
[00:17:38] >> BUT, LISTEN, OVER THE LAST
[00:17:40] DECADE, IT IS CLEAR TO ME AND
[00:17:42] CERTAINLY THE REPUBLICANS WHO
[00:17:43] ARE ON STAGE WITH ME.
[00:17:48] FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE
[00:17:51] PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP.
[00:17:52] FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY,
[00:17:53] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND
[00:17:54] HIS VICE PRESIDENT, ONE THAT HE
[00:17:56] IS UNFIT TO SERVE THAT HE IS
[00:17:58] UNSTABLE, THAT HE IS DANGEROUS,
[00:18:00] AND THAT PEOPLE ARE EXHAUSTED
[00:18:02] WITH SOMEONE WHO PROFESSES TO BE
[00:18:05] A LEADER WHO SPENDS FULL TIME
[00:18:08] DEMEANING AND ENGAGING IN
[00:18:10] PERSONAL GRIEVANCES AND IT BEING
[00:18:13] ABOUT HIM AND AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[00:18:15] >> Bret: IF THAT'S THE CASE.
[00:18:16] >> PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THAT.
[00:18:17] >> Bret: IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY
[00:18:18] IS HALF THE COUNTRY SUPPORTING
[00:18:20] HIM?
[00:18:20] WHY IS HE BEATING YOU IN A LOT
[00:18:21] OF SWING STATES?
[00:18:23] WHY, IF HE IS AS BAD AS YOU SAY
[00:18:24] THAT HALF OF THIS COUNTRY IS NOW
[00:18:26] SUPPORTING THIS PERSON WHO COULD
[00:18:28] BE THE 47TH PRESIDENT OF THE
[00:18:29] UNITED STATES?
[00:18:30] WHY IS THAT HAPPENING?
[00:18:31] >> THIS IS AN ELECTION FOR
[00:18:33] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[00:18:34] IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY.
[00:18:37] >> Bret: I KNOW.
[00:18:38] >> IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.
[00:18:39] IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A CAKE
[00:18:41] WALK.
[00:18:42] >> Bret: ARE THEY MISGUIDED THE
[00:18:43] 50%?
[00:18:44] ARE THEY STUPID?
[00:18:44] >> OH, GOD, I WOULD NEVER SAY
[00:18:46] THAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[00:18:47] AND, IN FACT, WHEN YOU LISTEN TO
[00:18:48] DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU WATCH ANY
[00:18:50] OF HIS RALLIES, HE IS THE ONE
[00:18:52] WHO TENDS TO DEMEAN AND BELITTLE
[00:18:56] AND DIMINISH.
[00:18:57] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[00:18:57] HE IS THE ONE WHO TALKS ABOUT AN
[00:19:00] ENEMY WITHIN -- AN ENEMY WITHIN
[00:19:03] TALKING ABOUT THE AMERICAN
[00:19:05] PEOPLE, SUGGESTING HE WOULD TURN
[00:19:07] THE AMERICAN MILITARY ON THE
[00:19:09] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[00:19:11] >> Bret: WE ASKED THAT QUESTION
[00:19:12] TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT TODAY,
[00:19:13] HARRIS FAULKNER HAD A TOWN HALL.
[00:19:15] AND THIS IS HOW HE RESPONDED.
[00:19:17] >> I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
[00:19:19] THEY WERE SAYING I WAS LIKE
[00:19:20] THREATENING.
[00:19:21] I'M NOT THREATENING ANYBODY.
[00:19:22] THEY ARE THE ONES DOING THE
[00:19:24] THREATENING.
[00:19:24] THEY DO PHONY INVESTIGATIONS, I
[00:19:26] HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED MORE THAN
[00:19:29] AL FONZ CAPONE.
[00:19:30] HE WAS THE GREATEST.
[00:19:31] IT'S TRUE.
[00:19:32] [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:33] IT'S CALLED WEAPONIZATION OF
[00:19:34] GOVERNMENT.
[00:19:34] IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.
[00:19:36] >> BRET, I'M SORRY, AND WITH ALL
[00:19:38] DUE RESPECT, THAT CLIP WAS NOT
[00:19:40] WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING ABOUT
[00:19:42] THE ENEMY WITHIN THAT HE HAS
[00:19:44] REPEATED WHEN HE IS SPEAKING
[00:19:45] ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[00:19:46] THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU JUST SHOWED.
[00:19:48] >> Bret: HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT
[00:19:50] SPECIFIC --
[00:19:50] >> -- THAT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU
[00:19:51] JUST SHOWED IN FAIRNESS AND
[00:19:53] RESPECT TO YOU.
[00:19:54] >> Bret: THAT WAS A QUESTION
[00:19:54] THAT WE ASKED HIM.
[00:19:55] >> YOU DIDN'T SHOW THAT.
[00:19:57] HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
[00:19:57] HE HAS REPEATED IT MANY TIMES.
[00:19:59] YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT AND YOU
[00:20:02] AND I BOTH KNOW THAT HE HAS
[00:20:03] TALKED ABOUT TURNING THE
[00:20:04] AMERICAN MILITARY ON THE
[00:20:05] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[00:20:06] HE HAS TALKED ABOUT GOING AFTER
[00:20:08] PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN
[00:20:10] PEACEFUL PROTESTS.
[00:20:11] HE HAS TALKED ABOUT LOCKING
[00:20:13] PEOPLE UP BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE
[00:20:15] WITH HIM.
[00:20:15] THIS IS A DEMOCRACY.
[00:20:18] AND IN A DEMOCRACY THE PRESIDENT
[00:20:20] OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE
[00:20:21] UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD
[00:20:26] BE WILLING TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE
[00:20:28] CRITICISM WITHOUT SAYING HE
[00:20:29] WOULD LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR DOING
[00:20:31] IT.
[00:20:31] AND THIS IS WHAT IS AT STAKE,
[00:20:33] WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE SOMEONE
[00:20:34] LIKE THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE
[00:20:35] JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF SAYING
[00:20:39] WHAT MARK MILLEY HAS SAID ABOUT
[00:20:41] DONALD TRUMP BEING A THREAT TO
[00:20:45] THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[00:20:47] >> Bret: IS HE QUOTE IN THE BOB
[00:20:48] WOODWARD BOOK THAT WAY, YES.
[00:20:50] LET ME ASK YOU THIS, MADAM VICE
[00:20:52] PRESIDENT.
[00:20:52] >> LET'S NOT DIMINISH THE
[00:20:54] SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT.
[00:20:55] >> Bret: YOU CALLED DONALD TRUMP
[00:20:56] IS HE MISGUIDED.
[00:20:57] YOU SAY NOW --
[00:20:58] >> -- HE IS UNSTABLE.
[00:21:00] >> Bret: YOU SAY HE IS UNSTABLE.
[00:21:00] >> IS HE UNSTABLE, BRET.
[00:21:02] >> YOU SAY HE IS UNWELL AND
[00:21:04] MENTALLY NOT STABLE.
[00:21:05] >> IS HE NOT STABLE AND WE
[00:21:06] SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED.
[00:21:08] >> Bret: THAT JOE BIDEN WAS ON
[00:21:09] HIS GAME.
[00:21:10] THAT RAN AROUND CIRCLES ON HIS
[00:21:12] STAFF.
[00:21:12] WHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICE THAT
[00:21:13] PRESIDENT BIDEN'S MENTAL
[00:21:15] FACULTIES APPEARED DIMINISHED?
[00:21:20] >> JOE BIDEN -- I HAVE WATCHED
[00:21:22] HIM FROM THE OVAL OFFICE TO THE
[00:21:24] SITUATION ROOM.
[00:21:26] AND HE HAS THE JUDGMENT AND THE
[00:21:29] EXPERIMENT -- AND EXPERIENCE TO
[00:21:30] DO EXACTLY WHAT HE HAS DONE IN
[00:21:32] MAKING VERY IMPORTANT DECISIONS
[00:21:34] ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN
[00:21:35] PEOPLE.
[00:21:36] JOE BIDEN.
[00:21:36] >> Bret: NO CONCERNS RAISED?
[00:21:37] >> JOE BIDEN IS NOT ON THE
[00:21:39] BALLOT.
[00:21:40] >> Bret: I UNDERSTAND.
[00:21:40] >> AND DONALD TRUMP IS.
[00:21:41] >> Bret: YOU TALKED ABOUT IT
[00:21:43] AFTER GEORGE CLOONEY SAID WITHIN
[00:21:44] A FEW MINUTES OF TALKING TO
[00:21:45] PRESIDENT BIDEN AT A FUNDRAISER
[00:21:47] THAT HE THOUGHT THIS WAS NOT THE
[00:21:49] SAME JOE BIDEN.
[00:21:49] THAT WE SAW ON THE DEBATE STAGE.
[00:21:51] >> DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE
[00:21:53] BALLOT.
[00:21:53] >> Bret: I UNDERSTAND.
[00:21:54] YOU MET WITH HIM AT LEAST ONCE A
[00:21:55] WEEK FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS.
[00:21:56] YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS?
[00:21:59] >> I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
[00:22:01] HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT DONALD
[00:22:02] TRUMP, WHICH IS WHY THE PEOPLE
[00:22:04] WHO KNOW HIM BEST, INCLUDING
[00:22:06] LEADERS OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
[00:22:10] COMMUNITY HAVE ALL SPOKEN OUT,
[00:22:12] EVEN PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR HIM
[00:22:14] IN THE OVAL OFFICE WORKED WITH
[00:22:16] HIM IN THE SITUATION ROOM AND
[00:22:18] HAVE SAID HE IS UNFIT AND
[00:22:22] DANGEROUS AND SHOULD NEVER BE
[00:22:24] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
[00:22:26] AGAIN, INCLUDING HIS FORMER VICE
[00:22:28] PRESIDENT, WHICH IS WHY THE JOB
[00:22:30] WAS OPEN FOR HIM TO CHOOSE
[00:22:34] ANOTHER RUNNING MATE.
[00:22:36] SO, THAT IS A FACT.
[00:22:38] THAT IS A FACT.
[00:22:41] >> Bret: MADAM VICE PRESIDENT,
[00:22:43] TWO MORE THINGS.
[00:22:44] YOU WERE ASKED ON "60 MINUTES"
[00:22:45] ABOUT THE BIGGEST THREAT THAT
[00:22:48] THE WORLD FACES, THAT THE U.S.
[00:22:50] FACES.
[00:22:50] THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID.
[00:22:52] >> WHICH FOREIGN COUNTRY DO YOU
[00:22:54] CONSIDER TO BE OUR GREATEST
[00:22:57] ADVERSARY?
[00:22:57] >> I THINK THERE'S AN OBVIOUS
[00:23:00] ONE IN MIND WHICH IS IRAN.
[00:23:02] IRAN HAS AMERICAN BLOOD ON HEIR
[00:23:04] HANDS.
[00:23:05] OKAY?
[00:23:05] THIS ATTACK ON ISRAEL, 200
[00:23:08] BALLISTIC MISSILES, WHAT WE NEED
[00:23:11] TO DO TO ENSURE THAT IRAN NEVER
[00:23:16] ACHIEVES THE ABILITY TO BE A
[00:23:18] NUCLEAR POWER.
[00:23:18] THAT IS ONE OF MY HIGHEST
[00:23:21] PRIORITIES.
[00:23:22] >> Bret: A NUMBER OF EXPERTS
[00:23:24] SAID YOU WOULD SAY CHINA THE FBI
[00:23:26] DIRECTOR HAD SAID THAT YOU SAID
[00:23:27] IRAN.
[00:23:27] IF THAT'S THE CASE, WHAT DO YOU
[00:23:29] SAY TO CRITICS WHO LOOK AT THE
[00:23:30] ACTIONS OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION
[00:23:32] AND SAY YOU'RE NOT ACTING LIKE
[00:23:34] IRAN IS THE NUMBER ONE THREAT?
[00:23:37] >> WELL, I WILL TELL YOU MOST
[00:23:40] RECENTLY WHETHER IT WAS IN APRIL
[00:23:43] OR IN OCTOBER, AND SEVERAL HOURS
[00:23:47] ON EACH OCCASION THAT IRAN POSED
[00:23:50] A THREAT TO ISRAEL I WAS THERE.
[00:23:56] MOST RECENTLY IN THE SITUATION
[00:23:57] ROOM IN THE MOST RECENT ATTACK
[00:24:00] WORKING WITH THE HEADS OF OUR
[00:24:04] MILITARY DOING WHAT AMERICA MUST
[00:24:08] ALWAYS DO SUPPORTS AND DEFEND
[00:24:09] ISRAEL IN ITS REQUIREMENT TO
[00:24:11] DEFEND ITSELF AND TO GIVE
[00:24:14] AMERICAN SUPPORT, TO BE ABLE TO
[00:24:16] ALLOW ISRAEL TO HAVE THE
[00:24:19] RESOURCES, TO DEFEND ITSELF
[00:24:21] AGAINST ATTACK, INCLUDING FROM
[00:24:22] IRAN AND IRAN'S TERRORIST
[00:24:26] PROXIES IN THE REGION.
[00:24:27] >> Bret: RIGHT.
[00:24:28] >> AND THAT IS MY COMMITMENT TO
[00:24:31] THAT IS UNYIELDING AND
[00:24:34] UNWAVERING.
[00:24:34] >> Bret: CRITICS JUST SAY THAT
[00:24:35] YOU EITHER RELAXED OR FAILED TO
[00:24:37] ENFORCE SANCTIONS ON IRAN
[00:24:39] ALLOWING ALL OF THIS MONEY TO
[00:24:40] FLOW INTO IRAN LIKE BILLIONS IN
[00:24:43] OIL PROFITS.
[00:24:44] >> LET'S GO BACK TO DONALD TRUMP
[00:24:45] WHO PULLED OUT OF A DEAL THAT
[00:24:47] WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY PUT.
[00:24:49] >> Bret: BUT HERE.
[00:24:50] >> PUT IRAN IN CHECK AND IT WAS
[00:24:52] DURING DONALD TRUMP DONALD
[00:24:57] TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION WE HAD A
[00:24:59] AMERICAN MILITARY BASE THAT WAS
[00:25:00] ATTACKED WHERE AMERICAN SOLDIERS
[00:25:04] SUFFERED TRAUMATIC BRAIN
[00:25:05] INJURIES AND DONALD TRUMP
[00:25:06] DISMISSED THEM AS HEADACHES.
[00:25:07] NOT TO MENTION THAT DONALD
[00:25:10] TRUMP.
[00:25:10] >> Bret: MADAM VICE PRESIDENT.
[00:25:11] >> TREATED AND TALKED ABOUT.
[00:25:12] >> PAST FEW YEARS.
[00:25:14] >> MILITARY SERVICE.
[00:25:16] >> Bret: CRITICS SAY.
[00:25:16] >> SUCKERS AND LOSERS.
[00:25:20] HAS DIMINISHED.
[00:25:20] >> Bret: WE ARE TALKING OVER
[00:25:21] EACH OTHER I APOLOGIZE.
[00:25:22] >> I WOULD LIKE THAT WE WOULD
[00:25:24] HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT IS
[00:25:27] GROUNDED IN FULL ASSESSMENT OF
[00:25:30] THE FACTS, WHICH INCLUDES, I
[00:25:32] THINK THIS INTERVIEW IS SUPPOSED
[00:25:33] TO BE ABOUT THE CHOICES THAT
[00:25:35] YOUR VIEWERS SHOULD BE PRESENTED
[00:25:37] ABOUT THIS ELECTION AND THE
[00:25:39] CONTRAST IS IMPORTANT.
[00:25:42] >> Bret: YEMEN.
[00:25:42] >> AND ON THE SUBJECT OF IRAN I
[00:25:45] AM OFFERING WHAT SHOULD BE AN
[00:25:48] IMPORTANT CONTRAST THAT IS
[00:25:49] PRESENTED FOR FOLKS TO MAKE A
[00:25:51] DECISION.
[00:25:52] >> Bret: AND THERE ARE CRIST
[00:25:52] PARTICULARS TO LOOK AT WHAT THE
[00:25:54] ADMINISTRATION DID AND SAY --
[00:25:55] AND THINK DIFFERENTLY.
[00:25:56] MADAM VICE PRESIDENT, THEY ARE
[00:25:57] WRAPPING ME VERY HARD HERE.
[00:25:59] I HOPE YOU GOT TO SAY WHAT YOU
[00:26:01] WANTED TO SAY ABOUT DONALD
[00:26:02] TRUMP.
[00:26:03] THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS.
[00:26:05] >> I I HAVE MUCH MORE TO SAY,
[00:26:08] ACTUALLY.
[00:26:08] >> Bret: PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN
[00:26:09] BUT AND YOUR POLICIES.
[00:26:10] THAT'S WHY WE INVITED YOU HERE.
[00:26:11] >> I INVITE EVERYONE TO GO TO
[00:26:13] KAMALA HARRIS.COM AND YOU WILL
[00:26:15] SEE THAT I HAVE 80 PAGES OF
[00:26:18] POLICIES THAT ARE QUITE
[00:26:20] COMPREHENSIVE AND SHOULD BE
[00:26:22] ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WHO WOULD
[00:26:23] LIKE TO READ THEM.
[00:26:25] AND IT INCLUDES WHAT I INTEND TO
[00:26:27] DO ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
[00:26:28] WHAT I INTEND TO DO ABOUT SMALL
[00:26:31] BUSINESSES.
[00:26:32] >> Bret: THAT'S WHY WE INVITE
[00:26:33] YOU HAD YOU TO HERE WHERE YOU
[00:26:34] WERE IN 2019 AND WHERE YOU ARE
[00:26:36] NOW.
[00:26:37] >> AMERICA'S MILITARY AND MAKE
[00:26:38] SURE WE HAVE THE MOST LETHAL AND
[00:26:40] FIGHTING FORCE IN THE WORLD.
[00:26:42] >> Bret: MADAM VICE PRESIDENT

[00:26:44] HERE
