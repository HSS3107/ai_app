[00:00:00] okay today I'm going to talk about how
[00:00:03] to succeed with a startup obviously more
[00:00:05] than can be said here in 20 minutes but
[00:00:06] I will do the best I can the most
[00:00:09] important thing the number one lesson we
[00:00:11] try to teach startups is that the degree
[00:00:14] to which you're successful approximates
[00:00:16] the degree to which you build a product
[00:00:18] that is so good people spontaneously
[00:00:20] tell their friends about it startups
[00:00:23] always ask us for the secret to success
[00:00:25] they always want to believe it's
[00:00:26] something other than this because this
[00:00:27] is really hard to do but this is it if
[00:00:30] you can build a product that is so good
[00:00:32] people spontaneously tell their friends
[00:00:34] about it you have done 80% of the work
[00:00:36] that you need to be a really successful
[00:00:37] startup if you think about the most
[00:00:40] successful companies you know Google
[00:00:42] Facebook whatever you probably found out
[00:00:45] about them because a friend of yours
[00:00:46] said you got to try this it's great so
[00:00:49] this is the bar something that people
[00:00:51] love so much they tell their friends
[00:00:52] about it
[00:00:53] one important indicator for a product
[00:00:56] like that is a product it's simple to
[00:00:58] explain and easy to understand if you
[00:01:01] can't explain in a few words what you do
[00:01:03] and if people don't if at least some
[00:01:04] people don't say oh that's pretty
[00:01:05] interesting
[00:01:06] that's usually a mistake it's usually a
[00:01:08] sign of unclear thinking or a need that
[00:01:10] is not big enough
[00:01:13] another thing that startups need to look
[00:01:15] for is a market that is either started
[00:01:18] to undergo or is soon going to under
[00:01:19] grow exponential growth I think this is
[00:01:22] actually related to one of the biggest
[00:01:23] mistakes investors make when evaluating
[00:01:25] startups investors always say well
[00:01:28] what's your growth rate we care about
[00:01:29] the growth rate investors will forgive
[00:01:31] smallish revenue today if it's growing
[00:01:33] quickly for some reason people don't
[00:01:35] think about markets this way but if you
[00:01:37] think about the most important startups
[00:01:39] they are the ones that I start in small
[00:01:41] markets that are growing very very
[00:01:43] quickly 11 years ago the market for
[00:01:46] iPhone apps is zero dollars it's not
[00:01:47] huge and I think if you only think about
[00:01:50] the TAM today you'll make a big mistake
[00:01:52] what you really want to do is identify a
[00:01:55] market that's going to grow every year
[00:01:57] and be able to ride that up elevator a
[00:02:00] really important thing to figure
[00:02:02] figuring this out is learning how to
[00:02:04] differentiate between real trends and
[00:02:06] fake trends a real trend is something
[00:02:09] that's actually going to happen in the
[00:02:10] fake trend is not or at least not yet
[00:02:11] and before
[00:02:13] you make a big bet on a new platform you
[00:02:15] want to make sure it's real now there's
[00:02:17] an easy trick for this which I'll share
[00:02:19] now real trends are ones where a new
[00:02:22] technology platform comes along and the
[00:02:24] early adopters use it obsessively and
[00:02:26] tell the friends how much they love it
[00:02:28] a fake trend is one where people may buy
[00:02:30] the product but don't use it or at least
[00:02:33] not enough so an example of a real trend
[00:02:35] I already mentioned the iPhone I'll
[00:02:37] mention that again when the iPhone first
[00:02:39] came out many people were dismissive
[00:02:41] because they only sold a million or two
[00:02:42] million that year and they said well
[00:02:44] this just doesn't matter but for the
[00:02:46] people that had an iPhone they used it
[00:02:48] for hours every day it became central to
[00:02:50] their lives they loved it they told
[00:02:51] their friends you've got to get one and
[00:02:53] I think it was obvious then do people
[00:02:55] pay an attention that something had
[00:02:56] fundamentally shifted and we had a new a
[00:02:59] new computing platform that was gonna
[00:03:00] spawn huge businesses and it was a good
[00:03:03] time to bet on mobile apps a fake trend
[00:03:06] or at least a fake trend as of august
[00:03:09] 2018 I would say as VR I do believe VR
[00:03:12] will be big someday but today most
[00:03:14] people that I know that own a VR headset
[00:03:17] use it never or very rarely and so
[00:03:19] although a lot of people talk about it
[00:03:21] and maybe even a lot of people buy them
[00:03:22] there's not the intense usage per user
[00:03:25] among the early adopters that I think
[00:03:27] you want to see before you make a big
[00:03:29] bet another thing that startups need at
[00:03:33] least one evangelical founder usually
[00:03:35] the CEO someone at the startup has got
[00:03:38] to be the person that is going to
[00:03:39] recruit sell the product talk to the
[00:03:42] press
[00:03:44] raise money and this requires someone
[00:03:46] who can infect with enthusiasm the whole
[00:03:50] world about what the company is trying
[00:03:52] to do and someone who becomes the chief
[00:03:55] evangelist for the company it's very
[00:03:58] hard to succeed wildly without that it's
[00:04:01] very hard to build a team at all without
[00:04:03] being able to do that one thing that
[00:04:05] helps for this is having an ambitious
[00:04:07] vision you never want to be grandiose
[00:04:11] that turns people off but you want to
[00:04:12] let yourself grow more ambitious over
[00:04:14] time and as long as you do that
[00:04:16] organically people will respond
[00:04:18] ambitious visions are exciting they're
[00:04:20] fun to work on in fact I think in 2018
[00:04:23] at least in Silicon Valley it's easier
[00:04:26] to start a hard
[00:04:27] startup than it is to start an easy
[00:04:28] startup now this sounds paradoxical but
[00:04:32] ambitious projects are interesting you
[00:04:33] know in the current environment it may
[00:04:35] be relatively easy to raise capital but
[00:04:38] it's really hard to do everything else
[00:04:39] there are so many startups it's so easy
[00:04:41] to start one they all sound so promising
[00:04:43] that that bringing together enough
[00:04:46] talent in one organization is really
[00:04:48] hard to do and if you're working on a
[00:04:50] problem that you know maybe modestly
[00:04:52] successful it's it's kind of easy to get
[00:04:55] the first two people to join you can
[00:04:56] give them a lot of equity but then it
[00:04:59] gets really hard why is employee xx
[00:05:01] gonna join why is this why does this
[00:05:03] matter to the world why should someone
[00:05:04] work on your startup versus any of the
[00:05:06] other things they could do and picking
[00:05:09] something that matters if you're
[00:05:10] successful is a great way to do that and
[00:05:12] so I think it's really important to
[00:05:15] think about when you're starting a
[00:05:17] company how is this going to evolve into
[00:05:19] a vision that a lot of people want to
[00:05:21] help with but a lot of people want to be
[00:05:23] associated with because I think getting
[00:05:25] talent and getting mindshare it is
[00:05:28] really hard in the current environment
[00:05:29] and people are interested in startups
[00:05:32] that matter another thing that we've
[00:05:36] noticed among our best Saunders again
[00:05:38] and again and again is that they are
[00:05:41] have a confident and definite view of
[00:05:43] the future they may be wrong and so we
[00:05:47] say it's good to be confident and
[00:05:48] flexible but this idea that you are
[00:05:50] confident in definite this is what I
[00:05:52] think is going to happen or this is what
[00:05:54] is going to happen and being relatively
[00:05:57] sure of that having courage of your
[00:06:00] convictions being a clear leader saying
[00:06:02] we're gonna do this and that's why even
[00:06:05] in the face of a lot of doubt that seems
[00:06:07] to really correlate with success and
[00:06:10] this comes back to having an ambitious
[00:06:14] vision but the entire startup ecosystem
[00:06:16] is best set up to support companies that
[00:06:19] have a low chance of success but are
[00:06:21] huge if they work and I think going for
[00:06:24] something that is huge if it works will
[00:06:27] attract the best people
[00:06:30] not going to talk too much about the
[00:06:32] team there are a lot of obvious things I
[00:06:34] could say that have been said many times
[00:06:36] by many people about you know you need
[00:06:39] smart people who want to work really
[00:06:40] hard and who communicate well these are
[00:06:42] all really true but I'd like to mention
[00:06:44] a few non-obvious things that we've
[00:06:46] noticed that we don't hear people say as
[00:06:48] much about the team you need to assemble
[00:06:50] the note Khosla says that the team you
[00:06:53] build is the company you build and I
[00:06:55] really think that's true I've still met
[00:06:58] only a handful of founders I think that
[00:07:00] spend enough time on recruiting like
[00:07:01] Mark Zuckerberg is famously one of them
[00:07:03] but building a great team I think other
[00:07:06] than picking the right market and
[00:07:08] building a great product is the most
[00:07:09] important thing you do all founders go
[00:07:12] through a transition all successful
[00:07:14] founders where you switch from building
[00:07:15] a product to building a company and
[00:07:17] building a company really is about the
[00:07:19] team so you need to mist the whole world
[00:07:25] will be telling you why you're gonna
[00:07:26] fail as a start-up if you don't have
[00:07:28] that internal fire of belief if you
[00:07:30] don't have people who say you know what
[00:07:32] we are gonna do this and it doesn't
[00:07:33] matter what the haters say we're gonna
[00:07:35] figure this out and there is you know
[00:07:37] this problem it must be solvable if you
[00:07:40] don't have the spirit of optimism on the
[00:07:42] team it's very hard to succeed when the
[00:07:44] world continues to punch you in the face
[00:07:47] you need at least some idea generators
[00:07:49] there are a handful of people in any
[00:07:52] company that has gone on to be really
[00:07:54] successful that I that I've been able to
[00:07:56] work with who are just really good at
[00:07:58] coming up with lots of ideas you don't
[00:08:01] too many these people because that's
[00:08:03] more ideas than a company can follow
[00:08:04] through on but having some people within
[00:08:07] a company that are just constantly
[00:08:09] throwing out new ideas most of which
[00:08:12] will be bad it turns out to be super
[00:08:14] important to have on the team this
[00:08:18] spirit of we'll figure it out is my
[00:08:20] favorite thing to hear among early
[00:08:23] startup team members a lot of things go
[00:08:26] wrong the situations that startups win
[00:08:28] in tend to be incredibly dynamic and so
[00:08:31] this idea that even if I'm not qualified
[00:08:33] on paper even if I haven't solved this
[00:08:35] problem before even if this problem
[00:08:37] feels like it's gonna kill the company
[00:08:38] which many problems will feel that way
[00:08:40] this spirit among the team of you know
[00:08:44] what we've got the
[00:08:44] people we need we're gonna figure this
[00:08:46] out we're gonna get this done that's
[00:08:48] super important another thing that I
[00:08:52] love to hear from early team members is
[00:08:54] I've got it so you know you hear in big
[00:08:57] companies a lot of people say that's not
[00:08:58] my department someone else is gonna do
[00:08:59] that yeah or you know who this is really
[00:09:02] bad this is gonna hurt us and you want
[00:09:04] people who just step up and say I'll do
[00:09:05] it I've got it don't worry about it you
[00:09:10] want people to have a bias towards
[00:09:11] action startups especially in their
[00:09:14] early days often win by moving very
[00:09:16] quickly you never get as much data as
[00:09:19] you'd like you never have as much time
[00:09:20] to deliberate as you'd like and you want
[00:09:22] people who will are willing to act with
[00:09:26] much less data than they'd like to have
[00:09:28] with much less certainty and then if
[00:09:30] they act then it doesn't work they adapt
[00:09:32] really quickly and try something else we
[00:09:37] talk also about the blessing of
[00:09:38] inexperience we have seen many of our
[00:09:41] startups do incredible things because no
[00:09:43] one told them it was hard no one told
[00:09:45] them they can't do it um there's a great
[00:09:47] quote from Steve Wozniak about how all
[00:09:49] the best things he ever did came from
[00:09:50] having no experience whatsoever and
[00:09:52] having no money and you know that
[00:09:56] obviously is not always true but there
[00:09:58] is a magic thing that happens with
[00:09:59] startups especially in their early days
[00:10:01] before they've learned they're not
[00:10:02] supposed to be able to do certain things
[00:10:04] and so I think as a start-up again
[00:10:07] doesn't work to have everybody being
[00:10:08] experienced but you can take more bets
[00:10:11] than you normally would on inexperienced
[00:10:13] but super high potential people that's
[00:10:16] the end of a topic on on team one of the
[00:10:20] most important jobs you have as a
[00:10:21] founder is to never lose momentum and
[00:10:24] this is a little bit depressing because
[00:10:26] it means for the first few years you
[00:10:27] never get to take your foot off of the
[00:10:29] gas you never get to really rest we try
[00:10:32] to be honest about this that startups
[00:10:34] are not the best choice for work-life
[00:10:35] balance at all but especially in the
[00:10:37] early days startups survive on their own
[00:10:40] momentum if you have momentum people
[00:10:43] keep delivering results beyond what they
[00:10:45] think they're capable of if you lose
[00:10:47] momentum it's very difficult to get it
[00:10:49] back and so continuing to make sure that
[00:10:52] the startup has a cadence that the
[00:10:54] startup keeps winning on a relatively
[00:10:56] predictively short and predictable and
[00:10:59] this is really important and it's up to
[00:11:01] the founders to make sure that that you
[00:11:02] don't lose ahold of this
[00:11:05] another thing that we think startups
[00:11:09] need is a competitive advantage over
[00:11:11] time now this is something that sounds
[00:11:13] so obvious I hesitated to even put it in
[00:11:15] this is well discussed but we're seeing
[00:11:19] more and more startups apply to YC and
[00:11:22] when we ask them so what is the long
[00:11:24] term monopoly effect here what is the
[00:11:26] long term competitive advantage what is
[00:11:28] you know where is the network effect in
[00:11:30] this business they look at us like it's
[00:11:31] the first time we've ever they've ever
[00:11:33] heard this question all of the really
[00:11:36] great businesses I know have an answer
[00:11:38] to this question and in fact the better
[00:11:40] they are the more they pretend not to
[00:11:42] but this is something that you you want
[00:11:45] to have a plan for another thing you
[00:11:47] want to have a plan for is at least a
[00:11:49] sensible business model you don't have
[00:11:51] to have it all figured out at the
[00:11:52] beginning but when we ask founders so
[00:11:55] how are you ever going to make money and
[00:11:56] they look at us like it's the first time
[00:11:58] they've ever been asked that question
[00:11:58] which happens more often than you would
[00:12:00] think recently that's a bad sign too
[00:12:04] again this one is so common that I
[00:12:06] hesitate to put it in here
[00:12:08] but when we ask a start-up how they're
[00:12:10] gonna grow how they're gonna get users
[00:12:12] and they look at us like it's the first
[00:12:13] time they've ever heard that question
[00:12:15] bad sign so some sensible idea to try
[00:12:18] here first
[00:12:21] Paul Buchheit once spent a bunch of time
[00:12:24] looking one of the YC partners spent a
[00:12:26] bunch of time looking at the traits of
[00:12:28] our best founders and tried to distill
[00:12:31] down what they were and he came up with
[00:12:33] a frugality focus obsession and love
[00:12:35] I actually I think that is really good I
[00:12:38] don't know how much to add but I think
[00:12:41] these are things that you should be able
[00:12:42] to say about what you're doing and you
[00:12:44] as a founder and finally I want to talk
[00:12:48] about why startups get to be big
[00:12:50] companies we've there are lots of
[00:12:53] reasons I'm going to talk about a few
[00:12:54] common ones here I think these trends
[00:12:57] are valuable enough that as you evaluate
[00:12:59] startup ideas you might do it's worth
[00:13:02] thinking about if you fit into these
[00:13:04] because it's really hard for startups to
[00:13:06] beat big companies most of the time and
[00:13:08] here are some areas where we see it
[00:13:10] happening repeatedly
[00:13:13] so I think one difference is if you are
[00:13:17] a product manager at a big company and
[00:13:19] you want to do something that sounds
[00:13:21] sounds like a bad idea but is a good
[00:13:23] idea you have to get everybody from your
[00:13:26] boss sometimes all the way up to the CEO
[00:13:28] to say yes so one no can kill you if
[00:13:32] you're a start-up you can go to I see
[00:13:35] demo day any number of the thousands of
[00:13:37] investors can say yes and you get to
[00:13:38] have a crack at it so it's a very
[00:13:41] different mindset and for those ideas
[00:13:43] that sound bad but are good because of
[00:13:46] this phenomenon this one no versus one
[00:13:48] yes startups can win in fact startups
[00:13:51] usually do beat big companies in that
[00:13:52] category of ideas so look look for ideas
[00:13:56] that sound bad but are good and where
[00:13:59] you are much more likely to get one yes
[00:14:02] then someone in a big company is to get
[00:14:04] all yeses another area where startups
[00:14:09] usually be big companies aren't very
[00:14:11] fast changing markets startups great
[00:14:13] speed great advantage is an agility and
[00:14:15] speed the more a market is changing the
[00:14:18] higher the number of decisions you get
[00:14:19] to make and the higher number of tweaks
[00:14:22] to your product and your strategy you
[00:14:25] get to make and you want to optimize the
[00:14:26] number of those decisions that someone
[00:14:29] has to make to compete with you because
[00:14:31] a big company will make them on average
[00:14:33] worse than certainly much slower than
[00:14:34] you do so the speed of market evolution
[00:14:38] gives you a lot more chances to compound
[00:14:40] your advantage over a big company and
[00:14:44] then finally startups usually win on big
[00:14:47] platform shifts many people have
[00:14:50] observed that startups companies
[00:14:51] clusters those clusters usually come
[00:14:54] after a big platform shift we'll stick
[00:14:56] with the iPhone example here after
[00:14:59] mobile apps became a thing many new
[00:15:02] companies got started that are now quite
[00:15:04] valuable and one of the reasons here is
[00:15:07] you know most large companies work on
[00:15:10] sort of an annual cadence at least and
[00:15:11] when there's a huge platform shift they
[00:15:14] are not good at making a big enough
[00:15:17] strategic pivot the Battleship just
[00:15:19] turns too slowly whereas a start-up can
[00:15:22] say wow woke up this morning the world
[00:15:24] is fundamentally different than it was
[00:15:25] six months ago we're gonna go all in on
[00:15:27] this new direction and so that's a way
[00:15:29] that startups usually win or that that's
[00:15:31] an area where startups usually win there
[00:15:33] there are many others but thinking about
[00:15:37] these three I think is is directionally
[00:15:39] a good thing to do alright that's all
[00:15:42] I've got for today Jeff thank you very
[00:15:44] much for having me and for the class
[00:15:53] you
