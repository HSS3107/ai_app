Here's how to build AI Agents with the new OpenAI o1 model.

Transcript:

[00:00:00] my name is David Andre and here is how
[00:00:01] to build AI agents with open AI 01 now
[00:00:04] what even is 01 well it is the best AI
[00:00:06] model at math coding and PhD level
[00:00:09] science questions basically it is the
[00:00:11] most capable and intelligent AI model in
[00:00:13] the world and it comes from open AI now
[00:00:15] here is why AI agents matter the number
[00:00:17] of people searching for AI agents is
[00:00:19] growing exponentially meaning this is a
[00:00:22] once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
[00:00:24] automate tasks build products and make
[00:00:26] tons of money so don't miss it here's my
[00:00:29] promise if you watch Until the End
[00:00:31] you'll know exactly what to do to profit
[00:00:33] from the agent boom now here's a problem
[00:00:35] with ch GPT we can use oan inside of
[00:00:38] cgbd today however it comes with several
[00:00:41] problems there's a very low message
[00:00:43] limit only 30 messages per week also you
[00:00:45] need to pay for chbd plus which costs 20
[00:00:48] bucks a month and you cannot build AI
[00:00:50] agents with it or any other software for
[00:00:52] that matter here's the solution build AI
[00:00:54] agents now what even are AI agents you
[00:00:57] can think of Agents as your personal AI
[00:00:59] employees the they'll do whatever task
[00:01:00] you give them so with AI agents you can
[00:01:02] automate basically any task or process
[00:01:05] as long as you build it right and you
[00:01:06] can do this either for yourself or for
[00:01:08] others in return for money now you might
[00:01:10] be thinking okay David but I don't know
[00:01:12] how to code listen in 2024 you don't
[00:01:15] even need to know how to code because AI
[00:01:18] can do all the coding for us and I'll
[00:01:19] show you exactly how to do this plus
[00:01:21] we'll utilize the templates and presets
[00:01:23] we have in the new Society to save even
[00:01:25] more time now as long as you can speak
[00:01:26] English you can build basically anything
[00:01:29] including AI agents now here is how
[00:01:30] agents can lead to Big profits in the
[00:01:33] next two years every single business
[00:01:35] will need AI agents period those that
[00:01:37] will not use them will fall behind and
[00:01:39] sure few businesses will build it
[00:01:41] themselves but the vast majority
[00:01:43] especially small and mediumsized
[00:01:44] companies will require outside help
[00:01:46] having the skill of building AI agents
[00:01:48] will be like having the ability to
[00:01:50] create websites in the early '90s on
[00:01:53] steroids so let's get to building the
[00:01:55] first step is to open a code editor I
[00:01:57] will be using cser if you don't have
[00:01:59] cser just go to cursor. comom and
[00:02:02] personally I would say this is the best
[00:02:04] AI code editor right now if you do have
[00:02:05] cursor and you want to be more advanced
[00:02:07] in the new Society we have a amazing 30
[00:02:10] plus minute Advanced tutorial actually
[00:02:12] 50 minute Advan tutorial on kser which I
[00:02:14] would highly recommend you watch by the
[00:02:16] way new Society is the first link in the
[00:02:17] description so inside of cursor let's
[00:02:19] open up an empty folder boom and now
[00:02:23] we're going to use the official open a
[00:02:25] documentation if you don't know how to
[00:02:27] find it just type in open AI dogs into
[00:02:29] Google or you can go directly to this
[00:02:30] website platform. open.com
[00:02:34] slocs okay so in here we already see the
[00:02:37] main quick start so we can just copy
[00:02:39] this piece of code go into cursor and
[00:02:41] here's why cursor is my favorite code
[00:02:42] editor you can type in control I which
[00:02:45] opens up the composer let me actually
[00:02:47] create a new one because this one
[00:02:49] already has some info so this is a new
[00:02:50] composer and I can just
[00:02:53] say create a
[00:02:55] main.py file in
[00:02:58] there put this basic open aai API call
[00:03:04] using this exact
[00:03:07] format this very important because
[00:03:09] sometimes it can hallucinate from its
[00:03:11] training data and then I'm going to say
[00:03:13] also create a EnV
[00:03:17] file all right that's enough for the
[00:03:19] first prompt so the beauty of cruster is
[00:03:22] that not only can It write code it can
[00:03:24] also create files and help you just
[00:03:26] build entire applications as long as you
[00:03:28] can speak English you can build AI
[00:03:30] agents okay so let's click on accept all
[00:03:33] and let's see what we have so here
[00:03:34] nothing crazy is going on it's literally
[00:03:36] the same code as right here but it also
[00:03:39] created the environment file for us
[00:03:41] where we need to put the API key so let
[00:03:44] me show you how to do that super simple
[00:03:46] when you're on the docks you can just go
[00:03:47] to dashboard now as you can see on the
[00:03:50] top right I'm already logged in if you
[00:03:51] are not logged in simply click on the
[00:03:53] button and use the same account as you
[00:03:55] have in ch GPT takes 20 seconds to log
[00:03:58] in once you do that click on
[00:04:01] dashboard on the left click on API keys
[00:04:04] and let's create a new API Key by the
[00:04:07] way this is treat the secretly do not
[00:04:08] share this with other people it is Tre
[00:04:11] as passwords basically right so I'm
[00:04:13] going to name it um new Society 01 agent
[00:04:18] create secret key let's copy this now
[00:04:21] I'm going to go back into cursor I'm
[00:04:24] going to put it right here but also this
[00:04:27] is a comment right as you can see it
[00:04:28] starts with hashtag so it's a comment so
[00:04:30] what we can do is we can highlight this
[00:04:31] do contrl K another keyboard shortcut
[00:04:34] and say
[00:04:37] um I added the API
[00:04:40] key please remove the comment and make
[00:04:44] it
[00:04:45] proper obviously I can just delete the
[00:04:47] hashtag but what I'm trying to show you
[00:04:49] is that you don't need to know what
[00:04:51] python syntax is you can just use cursor
[00:04:54] or any other AI tool just you can use CH
[00:04:56] GPT right to help you write the code for
[00:04:59] you as as long as you can take action
[00:05:01] and as long as you're willing to push
[00:05:03] through discomfort you're good to go
[00:05:05] you're already in the top 1% of people
[00:05:06] to be honest all right so let's save
[00:05:09] that just to make sure I'm going to
[00:05:11] delete this and contrl V again because
[00:05:15] sometimes the llm can make mistakes when
[00:05:17] rewriting API keys because it's
[00:05:19] predicting the next token so beautiful
[00:05:21] now we have the API key in here we have
[00:05:23] the API completion I'm just going to go
[00:05:25] into the chat I'm going to ask do we
[00:05:28] have everything necessary to do a test
[00:05:31] API call for open Ai and actually one
[00:05:34] more thing I'm going to do I'm going to
[00:05:36] go into back into the dogs click on dogs
[00:05:39] top right on the left I'm going to click
[00:05:40] on
[00:05:41] models and let's click on o1 preview and
[00:05:44] o1 mini and let's change it to o1 mini
[00:05:47] o1 preview is obviously better one but
[00:05:49] it's more expensive so if you don't have
[00:05:51] a big budget just go with o1 mini and
[00:05:53] actually I should probably say this I
[00:05:54] would highly recommend you when you're
[00:05:55] in the dashboard to put in your credit
[00:05:57] card and charge in a few dollars that
[00:05:59] that way open AI knows you're a real
[00:06:01] person you're not a bot right so you can
[00:06:03] you only have to do this once if you
[00:06:05] haven't used the API before make sure to
[00:06:07] do this that way you don't run into some
[00:06:09] random errors anyways I'm just going to
[00:06:11] copy the name exactly as it is 01 mini
[00:06:14] inside of C I'm going to replace our
[00:06:16] model with a One Mini the pr is kind of
[00:06:19] useless here I'm going to say um teach
[00:06:22] me about AI agents okay something a bit
[00:06:26] more useful and then I'm going to ask
[00:06:28] the cursor
[00:06:30] whether we have everything necessary to
[00:06:31] do a test API
[00:06:33] call and actually I'm going to do
[00:06:35] control enter that way it sees the
[00:06:37] entire code base not just the current
[00:06:39] file based on the code we have almost
[00:06:41] everything okay what do we not have
[00:06:45] seems like it is hallucinating here
[00:06:47] because it okay yeah o11 mini is a new
[00:06:50] model so it doesn't have knowledge of it
[00:06:51] so we can just ignore this let's close
[00:06:54] this contrl
[00:06:55] L and let's run it we'll either get an
[00:06:59] error or not either way we can solve it
[00:07:01] so we are not seeing an error which
[00:07:03] gives me hope that it is working fingers
[00:07:07] crossed with o1 mini it will take a few
[00:07:10] seconds oh we don't see the print
[00:07:12] statement oops so now CER is suggesting
[00:07:15] that so I think it worked but we didn't
[00:07:18] print out the response okay let's try
[00:07:20] again we probably should also have some
[00:07:22] you know debugging PR print statement
[00:07:24] above telling us that the API call is in
[00:07:28] progress or something like that
[00:07:30] but let's see boom there it is so it
[00:07:33] takes a few seconds and that's because
[00:07:34] oan and oan mini they do reasoning so
[00:07:36] they think before they answer this is
[00:07:38] what what makes them so powerful as we
[00:07:40] saw earlier in the presentation all
[00:07:42] right so we have a bunch I mean this is
[00:07:44] a very forough response right so what
[00:07:46] are AI agents key components of AI
[00:07:48] agents simple I mean this is this is not
[00:07:51] really this is not really what I meant
[00:07:54] but yeah as you can see sometimes it's
[00:07:55] not best to let it use training data all
[00:07:59] right so
[00:08:00] this is good we now know the API is
[00:08:03] working we can make successful API calls
[00:08:05] now we can build further right so this
[00:08:08] is we only have basically One agent we
[00:08:10] can rename it to like agent um let's do
[00:08:14] like let's make this uh business
[00:08:17] strategist so what I'm going to do I'm
[00:08:19] I'm going to build a team of agents that
[00:08:21] will help you or anyone else start their
[00:08:24] first business because that is always
[00:08:26] the hardest right so actually maybe we
[00:08:28] can leave it to complete and then wrap
[00:08:30] it in a function or let's not do
[00:08:31] anything and let's just use AI to figure
[00:08:34] that out okay so this team of Agents
[00:08:36] will help you get your first client
[00:08:38] either even if you have zero business
[00:08:40] experience it'll basically do everything
[00:08:42] from creating your offer telling you
[00:08:43] which platforms you should go to how to
[00:08:45] message people how many you should do a
[00:08:47] day answer any questions just help you
[00:08:50] in any way and we will utilize the most
[00:08:52] powerful models in combination with each
[00:08:54] other which obviously you cannot do in
[00:08:56] chat GPT or CLA because that's only a
[00:08:58] chat bot it's not a team of agents all
[00:09:00] right so let's open up the composer
[00:09:02] again control I I'm going to uh uh um
[00:09:07] let's go let's open up a new composer
[00:09:09] I'm going to say now that we have
[00:09:13] confirmed the API is working your
[00:09:17] task is to expand our a our project into
[00:09:24] four separate agents each
[00:09:27] one doing its own
[00:09:30] open AI API
[00:09:33] call the main agent will be a business
[00:09:39] strategist
[00:09:42] strategist actually you know what I'm
[00:09:44] going to put into structure the first
[00:09:46] agent will
[00:09:49] be um Niche let's say like a niche agent
[00:09:54] helping the user
[00:09:57] focus on a specific specific Niche and
[00:10:02] identify his um ideal Target
[00:10:06] Avatar the second agent will
[00:10:09] be let's see okay okay actually this
[00:10:13] this will be the second agent the second
[00:10:16] agent right let's the first one should
[00:10:18] be like basically trying to understand
[00:10:21] what what the user wants right because
[00:10:22] that's the issue with beginners they
[00:10:23] don't even know what what they want or
[00:10:25] what the problem is the first agent will
[00:10:27] be a Clarity agent
[00:10:31] which tries to understand what the user
[00:10:35] wants and how we can help
[00:10:39] him start making money with AI okay I'm
[00:10:44] probably should include even more as you
[00:10:45] can see this is prompt engineering you
[00:10:46] need to include enough context and make
[00:10:49] your prompts good if your promps are
[00:10:50]  your your outcomes are going to be
[00:10:53]  so I'm going to say for context we
[00:10:55] are building uh this
[00:10:59] business Builder team of agents that
[00:11:02] will help that will help
[00:11:06] entrepreneurs either
[00:11:10] start their own online business or grow
[00:11:14] their current
[00:11:17] business okay the team of Agents will
[00:11:21] consist of four separate
[00:11:24] agents which
[00:11:26] go which are called one after another
[00:11:30] okay first agent second agent that's
[00:11:32] good the third agent will be action
[00:11:37] agent telling the user exactly what to
[00:11:41] do next what platform to go to what
[00:11:46] search to find leads how to message
[00:11:52] them what to offer
[00:11:55] them okay that's good basically B
[00:11:59] basically ensuring the user takes action
[00:12:04] towards making
[00:12:06] money and the last agent will be the
[00:12:09] main one the business
[00:12:13] strategist which will put all
[00:12:16] these pre we should put all the previous
[00:12:20] responses all the responses from the
[00:12:23] previous agents together in a clear and
[00:12:27] concise way and deliver that to our user
[00:12:31] and then I'm going to say use the
[00:12:33] current code in main
[00:12:38] main.py exact let's
[00:12:41] do this is the official format from open
[00:12:46] AI in terms of the model use 01 mini for
[00:12:53] all agents
[00:12:55] except the business strategist
[00:13:00] which should use o1 preview okay this is
[00:13:03] pretty long PR so I'm just going to I'm
[00:13:04] just going to send it and then we can
[00:13:06] iterate from that
[00:13:09] on maybe I should also tell it like to
[00:13:12] keep things simple and not overthink
[00:13:14] stuff there's also tendency of models to
[00:13:16] just overthink
[00:13:19] right all
[00:13:21] right yeah let's let's reject all and
[00:13:24] let's edit our prompt implement this in
[00:13:27] the simplest way possible keep the
[00:13:31] prompts concise and simple we're going
[00:13:34] to build on top of that this is a good
[00:13:37] like good practice good rule of f when
[00:13:39] working with AI models just trying to
[00:13:41] keep it simple until you have something
[00:13:44] that works and then trying to expand
[00:13:45] upon that
[00:13:47] right
[00:13:51] okay so let's accept that so we import
[00:13:55] open AI then load. F this let Let's us
[00:13:58] load the envir variable then we import
[00:14:00] OS I don't know where this is used but I
[00:14:02] guess we'll see then we load environment
[00:14:06] variables wait will this be
[00:14:11] good it removed wait wait it removed the
[00:14:16] client H okay we have the client but I
[00:14:20] don't know if the environment variable
[00:14:22] gets loaded correctly let's check the
[00:14:24] documentation
[00:14:27] again uh uh uh
[00:14:29] I guess it should work like this yeah
[00:14:31] okay so Clarity agent gets the user
[00:14:34] input do we have a function for that we
[00:14:37] do let me put this to the side all right
[00:14:40] so using the same 01 mini is good then
[00:14:43] we have some system prompt you are a
[00:14:44] Clarity
[00:14:46] agent helping entreprene understand how
[00:14:48] to start making money with AI That's
[00:14:50] good Niche agent again o1 mini all right
[00:14:54] so one thing that's definitely missing
[00:14:56] is to add debug statements we need to
[00:15:01] add some
[00:15:02] debug print statements so that we know
[00:15:07] what's happening during run time don't
[00:15:10] overthink this just implement the most
[00:15:14] needed
[00:15:16] once right now there is we'll be like
[00:15:19] basically in the dark right until it
[00:15:21] finishes running which can be a lot
[00:15:22] because we're using three times 01 mini
[00:15:25] which takes like 5 seconds on average
[00:15:27] and then o1 preview which can take like
[00:15:29] minute on average right so we want to
[00:15:30] know what's going on in between so
[00:15:32] having these print statements is for
[00:15:35] sure useful let's accept
[00:15:37] that especially if you're a beginner you
[00:15:39] need to know even more what's what's
[00:15:41] happening right so before it calls API
[00:15:44] it says calling Clarity agent all right
[00:15:46] so this is pretty solid prompt you're CL
[00:15:48] you are a Clarity agent helping
[00:15:49] entrepreneurs understand how to make one
[00:15:51] with AI and then it takes the user input
[00:15:53] as the actual
[00:15:55] prompt H Clarity output okay
[00:15:59] okay then we have a niche
[00:16:02] agent calling Niche agent okay
[00:16:05] completion client chat completions doc
[00:16:07] create model o1 mini
[00:16:10] messages system content you are a niche
[00:16:13] a okay you are a niche agent helping
[00:16:15] entrepreneurs focus on specific nich and
[00:16:17] ideal Target Avatar all right so
[00:16:20] obviously these PRS could be much better
[00:16:21] but let's not overthink it based on this
[00:16:24] input help identify a niche and Target
[00:16:27] Avatar so as you can see it's using the
[00:16:29] output of our previous agent then we
[00:16:33] have the action
[00:16:34] agent you are an action agent providing
[00:16:37] specific steps for entrepreneurs to take
[00:16:39] those making
[00:16:41] money okay and then I I would probably
[00:16:43] put an encourage the user to not
[00:16:48] overthink and just start yes this is
[00:16:51] what you guys need okay given this Niche
[00:16:54] and Target Avatar what specific actions
[00:16:56] should the entrepreneur take business
[00:16:58] strategist is the main one so it takes
[00:17:01] everything and puts it together should
[00:17:03] also probably include the user input
[00:17:05] let's let's do
[00:17:07] that let's actually yeah let's let's
[00:17:11] let's highlight these two parts only and
[00:17:13] we going say the main business
[00:17:16] strategist agent should also somehow
[00:17:20] utilize the original user
[00:17:23] input let's submit that and as you can
[00:17:26] see it added user input as one of the
[00:17:28] parameters
[00:17:29] it put it into the prompt and into the
[00:17:32] call accept so this is why using AI
[00:17:35] tools such as cursor is so op because
[00:17:38] you you can save infinite time of coding
[00:17:40] and you can build stuff that's
[00:17:41] completely outside of your expertise
[00:17:43] because you're using the skills of the
[00:17:45] AI models okay you are a business
[00:17:48] strategist summarizing insights and
[00:17:50] strategies this is kind of bad this this
[00:17:53] this problem is kind of not
[00:17:55] good okay
[00:17:59] no I don't want to use o1 mini I want to
[00:18:02] select this line and say this this
[00:18:06] prompt is too weak it needs to say it
[00:18:11] needs
[00:18:12] to tell it
[00:18:14] to clearly and concisely explain
[00:18:20] the to the user what he needs to do and
[00:18:24] why yes prom is kind of kind of low kind
[00:18:27] of weak so we're going to rewrite that
[00:18:28] and we're using AI to run the promt as
[00:18:30] well okay you are a business strategist
[00:18:32] providing clear and concise guidance
[00:18:34] entrepreneurs Your Role is to synthesize
[00:18:36] inites Focus action of
[00:18:39] strategy yeah this is much better promt
[00:18:42] much better summarize and present clear
[00:18:43] business strategy based on these inputs
[00:18:45] original idea so it lists out all the
[00:18:47] variables and then we have the main
[00:18:49] function which kind of puts everything
[00:18:52] together clation completed yeah we have
[00:18:55] some debugging stuff and then it prints
[00:18:57] the strategy so let's run it let's run
[00:19:00] it okay so run python file it's first
[00:19:03] it's going to tell me about your
[00:19:04] business idea or current business right
[00:19:05] so you obviously need to no this I'm
[00:19:08] going to use as a reference I'm going to
[00:19:10] use one of the businesses we teach in
[00:19:12] the new society which is the AI image
[00:19:15] model right creating custom models for
[00:19:18] luras which is exactly what rammon does
[00:19:20] actually need to update this he makes
[00:19:22] 4,000 amount right now but basically as
[00:19:24] you can see these are custom images that
[00:19:26] you can make for businesses that have a
[00:19:27] physical product so like some business
[00:19:29] is selling water bottles some business
[00:19:31] is selling clocks some business selling
[00:19:33] phone cases chairs tables you know bed
[00:19:36] sheets anything physical that can be
[00:19:38] visualized with AI images you can sell
[00:19:41] to these companies and now with the
[00:19:42] loras it's insanely fast I mean actually
[00:19:44] today I saw a pretty amazing post by
[00:19:46] Nico right here like look at these all
[00:19:48] of these are all of these are Ai and if
[00:19:51] you if I didn't tell you you wouldn't
[00:19:53] know it so you can do this with physical
[00:19:54] products as well so this is kind of the
[00:19:56] business model I'm going to explain to
[00:19:58] 01 agent right because I already know it
[00:20:01] works like we have members making
[00:20:03] thousands of dollars with it so tell me
[00:20:04] about your business idea or current
[00:20:06] business my business idea is to sell
[00:20:10] custom AI image models to companies that
[00:20:14] sell physical
[00:20:17] products such as
[00:20:19] sunglasses fashion phone cases I mean
[00:20:24] literally
[00:20:26] anything let's say like um or anything
[00:20:31] else okay those companies need to spend
[00:20:36] thousands of dollars on photographers
[00:20:39] models traveling sample sample products
[00:20:45] Studios and we can give
[00:20:48] them high quality creatives that include
[00:20:53] their exact product just how it looks in
[00:20:58] in real life for a fraction of the cost
[00:21:02] it takes them
[00:21:05] to do these photo shoots
[00:21:09] okay this is you right now we're
[00:21:12] describing the business model so I'm
[00:21:13] going to say okay I want to use
[00:21:15] Instagram to find companies who need
[00:21:19] this but I don't know how to start or
[00:21:23] what to do or how or what to message
[00:21:27] them please help okay actually let me
[00:21:30] copy this in case we need to reuse this
[00:21:33] prompt
[00:21:35] boom good we have it copied and enter
[00:21:38] now we have an error beautiful okay
[00:21:41] let's see what happens wrong so actually
[00:21:43] you can debug with AI but let's try to
[00:21:44] read this processing Trace back Trace
[00:21:48] back blah blah blah unsupported
[00:21:52] value so seems like
[00:21:56] the oh it doesn't support system problem
[00:21:59] this is good so basically let's go back
[00:22:02] to the documentation you can use the
[00:22:04] system prompt in most of the models like
[00:22:08] gbd4 um gbt 4 mini gbt
[00:22:12] turbo I mean all of the models
[00:22:14] essentially except for the o1 and o1
[00:22:17] mini they do not support system problems
[00:22:19] right
[00:22:20] so the cser doesn't know that so we need
[00:22:23] we need to tell it
[00:22:25] that I'm going to say
[00:22:28] I say we have a slight
[00:22:32] issue the o1 line of
[00:22:36] models
[00:22:38] do do not support system prompts meaning
[00:22:42] we have to fit all of our
[00:22:45] instructions into the main prompt
[00:22:48] rewrite the code to make this happen do
[00:22:53] not change anything else we don't want
[00:22:56] to write new code or you know refactor
[00:22:59] anything we just want to make this one
[00:23:01] change remove the system prompts and fit
[00:23:03] it into the main
[00:23:04] prompt all right now it's rewriting
[00:23:08] generating we can actually watch it code
[00:23:10] which is my favorite part seeing the AI
[00:23:14] working I don't know I could just do
[00:23:16] that all day okay so let's accept let's
[00:23:19] close the composer let's see now we
[00:23:20] don't have system PRS everything is fit
[00:23:23] inside of the main prompt which is good
[00:23:27] let's run again this is why I C the
[00:23:28] prompt you know otherwise it would have
[00:23:31] been lost so contrl V enter processing
[00:23:34] your input calling Clarity
[00:23:38] agent now in about 5 Seconds we should
[00:23:41] go to the next agent going to be the
[00:23:43] niche one calling Niche agent so maybe
[00:23:46] it'll be also good to display let's
[00:23:48] let's pause it I mean let's kill kill
[00:23:50] the terminal and we can just tell it
[00:23:52] okay let's open the
[00:23:54] chat actually not the terminal chat
[00:23:56] contrl l
[00:23:59] we need um right now we have good amount
[00:24:04] of debug print
[00:24:07] statements
[00:24:10] however we don't however I want to see
[00:24:14] the output of each agent when it
[00:24:18] finishes update the code to make this
[00:24:21] happen do not change anything else
[00:24:25] control
[00:24:26] enter so chat the chat feature is more
[00:24:29] of a chat right it's more to interact
[00:24:33] ask questions about the code stuff like
[00:24:34] that here I maybe should have used the
[00:24:36] composer
[00:24:37] because yeah let's actually use the
[00:24:39] composer here let's use the composer
[00:24:42] Boom the composer automatically can see
[00:24:45] all of the files and it's better for
[00:24:47] rewriting code the chat is more about
[00:24:48] asking questions so yeah maybe I should
[00:24:51] have followed my own Advanced curs
[00:24:54] tutorial from the classroom
[00:24:58] this one goes way deeper I mean this is
[00:25:00] just 56 minutes all about curser but
[00:25:02] let's go
[00:25:03] back so yeah it prints out the the
[00:25:06] outputs when we got
[00:25:09] them and also I'm going to say we have a
[00:25:11] lot of print statements that are not
[00:25:15] necessary because some are in the
[00:25:19] functions themselves and some in the
[00:25:23] main okay
[00:25:26] meaning it results in two print
[00:25:30] statements being called in backto back
[00:25:34] not useful fix this do not change
[00:25:37] anything else I mean probably you
[00:25:38] probably not don't need to say this
[00:25:40] every time but it's a good habit I think
[00:25:42] just remind it to stay
[00:25:45] focused and also let's reduce the number
[00:25:48] of print statements because Simplicity
[00:25:50] is key especially the more beginner you
[00:25:52] are the more simpler your code should be
[00:25:54] you need to at least understand what
[00:25:55] each part of the code does you don't
[00:25:57] need to know the syntax and all that you
[00:25:59] just need to not get lost that is the
[00:26:00] secret okay let's accept all right let's
[00:26:03] close this and let's
[00:26:07] run paste as one
[00:26:10] line did I seriously mess this up oh my
[00:26:15] God okay whatever let's try
[00:26:18] again I want to sell custom AI images to
[00:26:22] companies with physical products I know
[00:26:26] I want to use Instagram
[00:26:29] but I'm not sure how to find the
[00:26:33] companies to sell to what to message
[00:26:37] them what to offer them and how many to
[00:26:41] do a
[00:26:42] day help me make help me get my first
[00:26:47] paid
[00:26:50] client all right processing your input
[00:26:55] maybe we should actually use be
[00:26:57] interesting to use
[00:26:59] could be like gbd4 you know we could use
[00:27:02] the normal llms that are not reasoning
[00:27:04] for these steps but whatever it's about
[00:27:07] 01 let's just use o1 for everything
[00:27:09] so boom I mean this is a very good
[00:27:11] response oh my God so long this is one
[00:27:14] thing that's amazing about the o1 models
[00:27:17] they are not lazy they tell you
[00:27:18] everything so Clarity agent identify
[00:27:21] target market they find the idea client
[00:27:23] industry Focus companies that rely
[00:27:25] heavily on visual appeal amazing such as
[00:27:27] apparel home cord packaging this is
[00:27:29] already really good advice I mean
[00:27:31] obviously we teach this in the new
[00:27:32] Society but if you didn't know this this
[00:27:35] this is like Priceless so many people
[00:27:37] just Target businesses that do not need
[00:27:39] these AI custom models I mean wow
[00:27:43] already this this promp is amazing
[00:27:45] company size start with small to
[00:27:46] mediumsized businesses yes that are more
[00:27:48] accessible okay geographic
[00:27:51] location okay this I don't agree with we
[00:27:54] should Target USA because of the large
[00:27:57] GDP
[00:27:58] and since you're on the internet you can
[00:28:00] just sell to any Market not your local
[00:28:02] one research potential clients Instagram
[00:28:05] search use hashtags to find related
[00:28:06] indries handmade jewelry organic cos
[00:28:09] this is good this is good wow maybe we
[00:28:11] should I should probably add this into
[00:28:14] into our template section yeah I def
[00:28:17] okay I'm going to add it after after the
[00:28:19] recording we here we have like a bunch
[00:28:21] of templates used for gpts checklists
[00:28:22] and all that to use okay anyways
[00:28:26] competitor analysis look at this
[00:28:28] business is similar to what you want to
[00:28:30] Target okay I mean this is already
[00:28:32] really good advice and this is only the
[00:28:34] first this is just the first of four
[00:28:36] agents okay optimize your Instagram
[00:28:38] presence create a Professional Profile
[00:28:39] DM for inquiries showcase your work yes
[00:28:43] use relevant
[00:28:45] hashtags okay I mean wow sample DM
[00:28:47] template this is too try hard you want
[00:28:50] to start with simpler DMS we definitely
[00:28:52] have better scripts in the new Society
[00:28:54] but okay the model is not going to be
[00:28:56] perfect everything and this is not even
[00:28:57] the action model this is this this is
[00:28:59] not even the action agent this is just
[00:29:00] the clarity agent okay so let's scroll
[00:29:04] down I mean this is crazy you know what
[00:29:08] this is kind of bad to have all of this
[00:29:09] in the terminal let's let's change that
[00:29:12] let's uh you open our composer control I
[00:29:15] and I'm going to tell it the final
[00:29:17] response should not be printed out in
[00:29:22] the
[00:29:22] terminal instead it should be saved as a
[00:29:27] as a txt file that the user can open and
[00:29:31] read at any time it's kind of you know
[00:29:34] the terminal is is not a permanent
[00:29:35] solution
[00:29:37] okay implement this but do not change
[00:29:41] anything else boom now the business
[00:29:45] strategist will create a txt file an
[00:29:48] actual text file text document that we
[00:29:50] can visit even when we close cursor and
[00:29:54] even when the terminal is destroyed
[00:29:56] accept
[00:29:58] and let's rerun
[00:30:00] again I mean that was a really solid
[00:30:03] solid approach maybe we should uh
[00:30:06] actually you know what let's let's
[00:30:07] improve our prompt why not you are a
[00:30:09] Clarity okay so I'm going to say split
[00:30:12] the prompt into mul multiple multi-line
[00:30:17] string for better
[00:30:19] visibility
[00:30:22] enter all right
[00:30:24] accept now I'm going to say I'm going to
[00:30:27] have highlight our prompt and
[00:30:31] say
[00:30:33] let's let's okay let's be more explicit
[00:30:38] in the prompt telling
[00:30:41] the telling the AI model to en encourage
[00:30:46] the user to give the user practical and
[00:30:49] actionable advice telling it to Target
[00:30:53] companies in the
[00:30:55] US us since it's a large market
[00:31:00] and giving the user practical stepbystep
[00:31:06] instructions actually this is not even
[00:31:08] the
[00:31:10] advice okay and
[00:31:13] answering answering the seven most
[00:31:16] common concerns SL problems SL limiting
[00:31:20] beliefs the user might have at this
[00:31:23] stage and based on his initial Pro B
[00:31:29] input okay this is much
[00:31:31] better let's watch could us rewrite this
[00:31:36] all right it's adding a system PR this
[00:31:37] is very bad what is going on okay I'm
[00:31:40] going to see instructions do not add a
[00:31:43] system
[00:31:44] prompt fit everything into the main user
[00:31:52] prompt this is why you need to stay in
[00:31:54] charge you need to keep the model in
[00:31:56] check because sometimes it just goes
[00:31:58] line let's accept so we don't have
[00:32:00] system prompt we have the user prompt
[00:32:01] okay that's looks much better then for
[00:32:03] the niche agent right okay I'm going to
[00:32:07] say I'm going to highlight these three
[00:32:09] lines I'm going to say again split this
[00:32:12] into
[00:32:14] multiple lines for better visibility
[00:32:18] using multi-line string
[00:32:21] boom maybe I should just save it for the
[00:32:23] entire file but
[00:32:25] whatever now I'm going to say
[00:32:29] again control
[00:32:31] K you are a niche expert helping us
[00:32:34] focus on specific Niche and ID okay okay
[00:32:37] if the user already knows his Target
[00:32:42] Avatar just help him get more clear on
[00:32:48] what on how to
[00:32:51] appeal to that Avatar and how to close
[00:32:56] clients who fit that
[00:32:59] description but if the user is not as
[00:33:02] clear help him identify his Niche and
[00:33:08] Avatar okay that's good also do not add
[00:33:13] system
[00:33:14] promt make sure this doesn't
[00:33:19] happen right accept everything is in the
[00:33:22] user prom that's good
[00:33:25] save action agent your action agent
[00:33:27] provid
[00:33:28] actually we can just do it also the
[00:33:31] same split this using multi-line string
[00:33:36] for better Clarity I'm going to copy
[00:33:38] this I don't have to rewrite it multiple
[00:33:40] times like a dumbass accept save and
[00:33:44] then I'm going to Del it the same
[00:33:48] here so it's using CLA 3.5 Sonet by
[00:33:51] default cruster but you can also use o1
[00:33:54] you can also use o1 inside of cruster
[00:33:55] and honestly that could be an entire
[00:33:57] separate video so if you want to see how
[00:33:59] to use 0an with CER let me know in the
[00:34:03] comments also make sure to subscribe it
[00:34:06] takes two seconds and it helps out a lot
[00:34:08] all right this is this is good this is
[00:34:11] much more visible for us and let's
[00:34:16] go let's go and let's see how our team
[00:34:20] of agent works I want to start making
[00:34:23] money by selling custom AI models and
[00:34:28] custom AI images to companies who sell
[00:34:33] physical products such as sunglasses
[00:34:38] phone
[00:34:39] cases interior design I want to
[00:34:42] use Instagram as my platform but I'm not
[00:34:47] sure how to find these
[00:34:50] companies what to message
[00:34:52] them and how to get them to buy the more
[00:34:55] context you can provide the better
[00:34:58] I am a complete beginner when it comes
[00:35:02] to online business you know leave the
[00:35:05] ego at the door make sure you give
[00:35:07] context enter so now let's watch our
[00:35:10] team of agents in work first we're
[00:35:12] calling the clarity agent this one we
[00:35:15] already know is really solid from the
[00:35:17] previous test but now we even improv the
[00:35:19] system
[00:35:21] prompt I mean wow this is just crazy
[00:35:25] we're not even telling it to Output long
[00:35:27] prompt this is just the default right so
[00:35:30] hopefully it's telling us to Target us
[00:35:32] companies because of the larger GDP I'm
[00:35:35] not I'm not seeing it let's scroll
[00:35:38] down final encouragement nice but all of
[00:35:42] this if you've been paying attention how
[00:35:44] code is structured all of this will be
[00:35:45] fed into the final agent the business
[00:35:48] strategist which should output a clear
[00:35:50] and concise response so you don't have
[00:35:52] to be like oh my God this is confusing
[00:35:54] no these are just agents are generating
[00:35:56] necessary context for B our business
[00:35:58] strategist which will then create the
[00:35:59] txt file which is now being called this
[00:36:02] this should take more than 5 seconds
[00:36:04] because this is the powerful 01 preview
[00:36:06] model this is the best model opening I
[00:36:08] has so it takes between like 20 seconds
[00:36:12] to over 60 seconds depending on the
[00:36:14] complexity now it tooks like around 30
[00:36:16] so that's average let's open up the txt
[00:36:18] file and close the terminal close the
[00:36:21] chat so even the txt file is quite
[00:36:23] extensive maybe we should tell it to be
[00:36:25] more concise but let's see absolutely
[00:36:27] here is a f focused blah blah blah step
[00:36:29] one Define your service clearly decide
[00:36:31] exactly what you're offering custom AI
[00:36:33] models St AI solutions for companies
[00:36:35] gener descience AI generate images so we
[00:36:37] have two different options here why is
[00:36:38] crucial credit attracts clients so
[00:36:41] obviously you can start with probably AI
[00:36:43] generate images this super simple
[00:36:45] training allora takes 30 minutes and
[00:36:47] again in the new Society we teach you
[00:36:49] exactly how to do all of that step by
[00:36:51] step identify your target market action
[00:36:53] focus on specific industries by the way
[00:36:55] if you want all of this code and all
[00:36:56] these PRS I'm going to put it into the
[00:36:58] template section in the new Society so
[00:37:00] you can go into templates and just copy
[00:37:02] paste it and use this business team of
[00:37:04] Agents if you have a business that you
[00:37:06] want to grow or if you want to start
[00:37:08] your own business and you want this help
[00:37:10] you want this team of agents to help you
[00:37:12] okay let's see step four create a
[00:37:13] professional Instagram business profile
[00:37:14] yes build a portfolio use hashtags I
[00:37:17] mean this one's probably not necessary
[00:37:19] engage with potential clients I mean
[00:37:21] honestly given like how fast we build
[00:37:23] this this is pretty impressive reach out
[00:37:26] like this plan if you you use some like
[00:37:28] business consultant or whatever you know
[00:37:31] like somebody like if you use a person
[00:37:34] to help you start the business I don't
[00:37:35] think it would be this foro offer a free
[00:37:39] sample yes this is good especially if
[00:37:40] you have no demand you need to get a few
[00:37:42] free clients to get case studies to show
[00:37:46] to other people like if you order did
[00:37:48] you know five companies for free you you
[00:37:50] build custom L for them then you have
[00:37:52] much more leverage in selling other
[00:37:53] people because you can show your
[00:37:54] previous work so this is very good
[00:37:56] advice esta clear
[00:37:58] pricing it should probably say how much
[00:38:01] you should charge but just for context
[00:38:03] you should charge between 300 and 500 at
[00:38:05] the start per um let's say like 50
[00:38:08] images per week this is what we
[00:38:09] recommend but if you go higher if you
[00:38:11] have more demand you can obviously
[00:38:12] increase your prices but I wouldn't go
[00:38:14] lower below below 200 because then it
[00:38:16] seems then it like dilutes your work it
[00:38:18] seems sketchy why is it so cheap right
[00:38:20] seek feedback build testimonials of
[00:38:22] course you should do that continuously
[00:38:23] improve your skills scale your efforts
[00:38:26] final thoughts I mean yeah we should
[00:38:28] this could obviously be better but I
[00:38:30] think again for beginners this would
[00:38:32] tell you a lot of info a lot of limiting
[00:38:34] beliefs and you know just get started
[00:38:37] get started today yes set up your
[00:38:39] Instagram profile create your first
[00:38:40] portfolio and begin a connective l so
