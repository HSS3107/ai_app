[00:00:00] let's examine the facts
[00:00:02] yes fact fact fact fact great you're
[00:00:05] fine
[00:00:06] yes however
[00:00:08] sometimes we look at the facts and
[00:00:10] you're not fine
[00:00:12] [Music]
[00:00:13] this is michael seibel with dalton
[00:00:15] caldwell in our last video we talked
[00:00:17] about the setbacks that make founders
[00:00:19] feel like when running their
[00:00:20] startups
[00:00:22] and this time we're going to talk about
[00:00:23] how to prevent these punches to the face
[00:00:26] and
[00:00:27] how to take a punch and recover if you
[00:00:30] absolutely must
[00:00:32] so dalton i think the cool way to think
[00:00:34] about this is a little bit like health
[00:00:35] care there's preventative health care
[00:00:38] and then there's you know treatment
[00:00:40] so let's start with the preventative and
[00:00:42] let's set the set the framework here
[00:00:44] like
[00:00:45] a lot of times founders get punched in
[00:00:47] the face as almost unforced errors it's
[00:00:50] like a result of magical thinking or
[00:00:52] like other parts of their lives not
[00:00:54] being set up and so
[00:00:55] here are things you can do to either
[00:00:58] reduce the number of punches that come
[00:01:00] or at least reduce their intensity
[00:01:01] because you have your other locked
[00:01:03] up does that make sense
[00:01:06] yeah exactly it's like
[00:01:08] as we spoke to last time you can't think
[00:01:10] that you're not gonna have any setbacks
[00:01:12] and you're not gonna again take some
[00:01:14] punches
[00:01:15] it's gonna happen to you a hundred
[00:01:17] percent that the highs are high and the
[00:01:19] lows are low and so rather than assuming
[00:01:22] you can be so smart that you will never
[00:01:24] have low lows instead plan ahead
[00:01:28] put the
[00:01:29] infrastructure in place so that when you
[00:01:31] do have these these big challenges or
[00:01:33] these low moments
[00:01:35] you have the infrastructure set up that
[00:01:36] um you know you planned ahead for it i
[00:01:39] think that's very
[00:01:41] a very good idea so we were joking when
[00:01:44] we were talking about
[00:01:45] what to talk about in this video
[00:01:47] a lot of these things could be put in
[00:01:49] the category of adulting
[00:01:51] and it might turn out that if you want
[00:01:54] to be a founder of a very successful
[00:01:56] company
[00:01:57] you might have to adult
[00:01:59] harder
[00:02:00] than the people around you
[00:02:02] in fact it almost assuredly requires
[00:02:05] adulting harder than the people around
[00:02:06] you sometimes i think founders look at
[00:02:08] us and they're kind of like well you
[00:02:10] know my roommates don't do this so why
[00:02:12] do i have to and it's like well your
[00:02:13] roommates aren't trying to build a
[00:02:14] billion dollar company then they don't
[00:02:16] have to but
[00:02:18] maybe you need to be better than the
[00:02:21] people around you to do something
[00:02:22] extraordinary it's yet another thing
[00:02:24] that distances you from your peers
[00:02:26] and if you if your whole thing in life
[00:02:28] is i'm the same as my peers and i'm the
[00:02:30] same as my roommates that have jobs at
[00:02:32] like big tech companies
[00:02:35] this is yet another way that you're
[00:02:37] going to be isolated and different and
[00:02:39] have to learn to love that
[00:02:40] and not
[00:02:42] feel sad that when they're like hey
[00:02:44] we're going to go
[00:02:45] pull another all-nighter we're going to
[00:02:46] go party thursday friday saturday
[00:02:49] you have to be cool with opting out of
[00:02:51] that
[00:02:52] right yep but if you if you think you
[00:02:54] can have it all
[00:02:57] you can't i don't know if you can have
[00:02:58] it all you can't we're here to tell
[00:03:00] we're here to ruin that have it all
[00:03:02] dream
[00:03:04] so where i like to start is audit how
[00:03:07] you live
[00:03:09] like think about where you're waking up
[00:03:11] in the morning you know did you get
[00:03:12] enough sleep
[00:03:14] are you in a a place that's
[00:03:17] a home is it are you living in a place
[00:03:20] that makes you more powerful
[00:03:23] or less powerful
[00:03:25] are you sacrificing like are you losing
[00:03:27] hit points at home
[00:03:30] you know and if that's happening man
[00:03:31] that's unforced error right like so
[00:03:33] that's
[00:03:34] who you're living with
[00:03:36] what you're eating do you have easy
[00:03:38] access to exercise
[00:03:40] are you know are you living in a place
[00:03:41] with a bunch of alcohol and drugs
[00:03:43] everywhere
[00:03:44] you know not helping you like
[00:03:46] at the minimum your home should be
[00:03:47] neutral but i think for the most
[00:03:49] successful people the home's actually a
[00:03:50] plus like the home is like
[00:03:53] where they're making points where
[00:03:55] they're winning points and i think that
[00:03:57] a lot of founders in their early days
[00:04:00] don't understand how much they could be
[00:04:01] losing based on just how they're living
[00:04:03] yeah i think
[00:04:04] almost from a clinician's perspective
[00:04:07] when someone is having
[00:04:09] issues the first thing you look at is
[00:04:12] sleep disruption
[00:04:14] diet and exercise right if you go if you
[00:04:16] go look at you know research depression
[00:04:18] or anxiety and things
[00:04:20] that's usually
[00:04:21] where the 80 20 solution is for a lot of
[00:04:23] folks that are struggling is you look at
[00:04:26] their sleep patterns
[00:04:27] are they sleeping okay are they eating
[00:04:29] okay are they getting exercise or
[00:04:30] they're getting sun all these sorts of
[00:04:31] things and so if you don't have your
[00:04:33] house in order on those fronts
[00:04:35] you are not
[00:04:37] even if you don't currently have
[00:04:38] depression
[00:04:40] you are not well situated to deal with
[00:04:45] really hard things that might happen to
[00:04:46] you right
[00:04:48] but dalton
[00:04:49] i went to an ivy league school
[00:04:52] and it was really hard and i went to a
[00:04:54] really challenging high school and i
[00:04:56] didn't have to change these things to
[00:04:58] get good grades or to get the good
[00:05:00] internship like i did you know i was
[00:05:02] able to like work hard and play hard
[00:05:05] why do i have to change now it's working
[00:05:07] it's working for me this lifestyle
[00:05:11] i think i think it can work for people
[00:05:13] you and i know people that um certainly
[00:05:15] don't follow this advice and they still
[00:05:17] still did okay i just think you and i
[00:05:20] also know the same people
[00:05:22] where eventually you've got to pay the
[00:05:24] piper
[00:05:26] like at some point no matter it's almost
[00:05:28] like you're going into debt like
[00:05:30] personal health debt or whatever you
[00:05:31] want to call it and man yes you can go
[00:05:33] pretty far today you can go five years
[00:05:35] in a debt you can go 10 years into debt
[00:05:37] i don't know but at some point the debt
[00:05:39] comes due
[00:05:42] where you can't hold it all in anymore
[00:05:45] you can't hold the whole world on your
[00:05:46] shoulders and i think what we're just
[00:05:47] trying to say is if you
[00:05:49] start off with good habits early
[00:05:51] you're not going to incur this massive
[00:05:53] debt that one day causes you to have
[00:05:55] like um a breakdown or a meltdown again
[00:05:57] what do you want whatever you want to
[00:05:58] call it
[00:05:59] well and
[00:06:00] to double down on that
[00:06:02] i might argue that like
[00:06:04] you probably can sacrifice these things
[00:06:06] for five years like maybe even seven
[00:06:08] years
[00:06:09] the tricky thing is that like the best
[00:06:11] companies last multiple decades the
[00:06:14] tricky things is the that you can
[00:06:15] get away with in your 20s you can't get
[00:06:17] away with in your 30s
[00:06:19] and
[00:06:21] company running just gets harder and so
[00:06:23] i think sometimes people are like oh
[00:06:24] this is going to be a relative sprint
[00:06:26] but it's like
[00:06:27] what i like to talk to you about with yc
[00:06:29] founders a lot is like what happens if
[00:06:31] this works
[00:06:33] like are you set up for this to not work
[00:06:35] or are you set up for this to work
[00:06:37] because this works like
[00:06:40] you're going to be in it like you're
[00:06:41] going to be in it for a while and i
[00:06:42] think sometimes people set their lives
[00:06:44] up for it to like not work and then wow
[00:06:46] you know self-fulfilling prophecy and
[00:06:47] when you think about it this isn't an
[00:06:49] age thing this is a lifestyle thing
[00:06:52] because you'll see like
[00:06:53] 19 year olds with all the good habits
[00:06:55] and you'll see folks
[00:06:57] that aren't 19
[00:06:59] that like
[00:07:00] i still live like 19 years and so this
[00:07:03] isn't an age thing at all this is a
[00:07:04] habits thing man
[00:07:06] well and you'll even see successful
[00:07:08] people with good habits lose them
[00:07:11] and then wonder why they can't succeed
[00:07:12] again right it's like even just having
[00:07:15] these habits doesn't mean you keep them
[00:07:17] so okay so that's so that's that's your
[00:07:19] you know physical life style setup
[00:07:22] you want to talk about this kind of
[00:07:23] social media piece because i think that
[00:07:24] a lot of people
[00:07:26] don't understand how toxic social media
[00:07:29] it's like
[00:07:32] yeah i think i think you just want to
[00:07:33] look at your information diet the
[00:07:34] metaphor i think about this stuff with
[00:07:36] is uh the same way we have a food diet
[00:07:39] and like of course
[00:07:41] what we eat and drink affects our moods
[00:07:43] and how we feel i actually think the
[00:07:45] information we consume
[00:07:47] affects us and if you think about
[00:07:50] again like myself all of us you know
[00:07:52] when when it's a really heavy time in
[00:07:54] history when there's a lot going on when
[00:07:55] i'm doomed scrolling all the time
[00:07:57] reading about pandemic news or war news
[00:08:00] or whatever
[00:08:01] of course that affects my state of mind
[00:08:04] okay and so to some extent
[00:08:06] you can't completely stick your head on
[00:08:08] the ground about what's going on in the
[00:08:09] world no one's saying to do that
[00:08:10] but to the extent
[00:08:12] your social media habits
[00:08:15] make you feel bad or compare yourselves
[00:08:17] to people
[00:08:18] or say you follow a lot of like
[00:08:20] investors and everything they're talking
[00:08:22] about is the investment market and who's
[00:08:24] raising all of that and this is just
[00:08:26] every day you're bombarding your brain
[00:08:28] with stuff about investor
[00:08:31] why
[00:08:33] why is that good why how is that helping
[00:08:35] you actually run your startup
[00:08:37] reading what a bunch of investors say
[00:08:39] about the market
[00:08:41] all the time and i think people are
[00:08:43] surprised that like successful founders
[00:08:45] like explicitly block social media they
[00:08:47] do crazy things like
[00:08:49] you know they they grayscale their phone
[00:08:51] so it looks less interesting they turn
[00:08:53] off notifications they're aggressive
[00:08:55] users of like um
[00:08:57] screen time like tracking like they they
[00:08:59] actually
[00:09:01] pretty aggressively audit this stuff so
[00:09:03] that illiquidity saved you all and so
[00:09:05] again so if you're consuming if you're
[00:09:07] consuming media every day and you're
[00:09:08] reassessing the value like if you're too
[00:09:12] paying attention to this stuff it
[00:09:15] doesn't make you make better financial
[00:09:16] decisions does it
[00:09:18] no isn't that wild
[00:09:20] the next area i like to talk about is
[00:09:22] salary
[00:09:23] um
[00:09:24] oftentimes
[00:09:26] and and this is more of course for
[00:09:28] companies that have raised funding
[00:09:30] just a a small incremental five or ten
[00:09:33] percent cal salary bump can make a huge
[00:09:36] lifestyle difference
[00:09:38] and and it's almost always worth it like
[00:09:42] i think people screw up and this is what
[00:09:43] i say to founders i'd love to hear your
[00:09:45] advice
[00:09:46] if your startup salary is allowing you
[00:09:48] to save money
[00:09:51] it's probably not good
[00:09:53] right you shouldn't be sitting here like
[00:09:55] with google employee level savings
[00:09:57] running your startup
[00:09:59] however if your startup salary is giving
[00:10:02] you the lifestyle that
[00:10:04] allows you to be all in on your startup
[00:10:07] because the real world isn't distracting
[00:10:09] you negatively
[00:10:12] um then it is good and what's
[00:10:14] interesting is that often for different
[00:10:15] founders this is a different salary
[00:10:17] level you know perfect example when i
[00:10:19] was starting i had student loans in
[00:10:20] college my co-founders didn't
[00:10:22] i made a little bit more money so that i
[00:10:24] wasn't like going into debt with my
[00:10:26] student loans and that was
[00:10:28] perfectly reasonable and no one was like
[00:10:29] oh well you need to take x percent less
[00:10:31] because you need to pay a 200 student
[00:10:33] loan every month it's like no like
[00:10:36] so
[00:10:36] sometimes small changes in salary now
[00:10:38] you know if you have a co-founder where
[00:10:40] it's like i need to make a half a
[00:10:40] million dollars a year and i'm 23.
[00:10:44] yeah that's probably different but like
[00:10:45] sometimes people are sacrificing
[00:10:47] pennywise pound foolish right like
[00:10:49] sometimes we're being pennywise pound
[00:10:50] foolish
[00:10:51] i think this is one of those topics also
[00:10:53] like equity where what founders want to
[00:10:56] hear
[00:10:57] is here's the right answer one size fits
[00:11:00] all for everyone or here's the formula
[00:11:02] oh here's a spreadsheet
[00:11:04] here we go michael here's how much to
[00:11:05] pay yourselves just fill out the
[00:11:06] spreadsheet and we're done like and
[00:11:08] sadly like many things in life
[00:11:11] anyone that tells you their simple
[00:11:13] answers is probably trying to sell you
[00:11:14] something you know like
[00:11:16] [Laughter]
[00:11:18] right they're like
[00:11:19] yeah it's probably snake oil and
[00:11:21] and so the subtlety that i agree with
[00:11:23] you on is
[00:11:24] you want to pay yourself enough that you
[00:11:26] don't get into debt
[00:11:27] you want to pay yourself enough so that
[00:11:28] you're properly motivated you also want
[00:11:30] to keep enough
[00:11:31] you want to keep the money in the
[00:11:32] company like these are all
[00:11:35] variables that you have to turn and
[00:11:37] you know if you're going to be a
[00:11:38] successful founder you have to have good
[00:11:39] judgment and you have to have opinions
[00:11:42] and so when founders have no opinion
[00:11:43] about this stuff
[00:11:45] it's not a great sign so it's kind of
[00:11:46] like you need a philosophy
[00:11:48] of what you're solving for around
[00:11:49] compensation you want to set everyone up
[00:11:53] for success
[00:11:55] yes a line incentives well and also
[00:11:57] realize that this
[00:11:59] this looks different for every company
[00:12:01] man
[00:12:02] like a lot of folks ask me well how much
[00:12:03] should i pay employee number one i'm
[00:12:04] like
[00:12:05] that's a nonsensical question who are
[00:12:07] they what's you know do you see what i'm
[00:12:08] saying like like it's yeah like what
[00:12:10] they want is some answer oh you should
[00:12:12] pay employee number one x but like no
[00:12:14] man that's like no
[00:12:16] that's not how this works
[00:12:17] it was almost easier to come to these
[00:12:19] conclusions when i think back because we
[00:12:21] didn't have very much money and so we
[00:12:23] kind of had to tell me you know like
[00:12:24] whenever anything's scarce you have to
[00:12:26] ration it more effectively
[00:12:28] and i think that like our philosophy
[00:12:30] because i like what you're saying
[00:12:31] there's no formula but we had a
[00:12:33] philosophy which is like
[00:12:35] salary is for living and equity is for
[00:12:37] upside
[00:12:39] like that's that was the kind of
[00:12:41] philosophy
[00:12:42] um
[00:12:43] and i think that served us that served
[00:12:45] us pretty well um
[00:12:47] the next area of prevention
[00:12:50] you have to learn how to have
[00:12:53] hard conversations with your co-founders
[00:12:56] and for everyone to be okay afterwards
[00:13:00] um and
[00:13:03] everyone has to go through this and it's
[00:13:05] gonna suck but
[00:13:07] if you have some of those in the bag
[00:13:10] when you get punched in the face you all
[00:13:12] know a little bit more how to interact
[00:13:14] with each other
[00:13:16] and
[00:13:17] to me the biggest challenge that i've
[00:13:18] seen on this front we've talked about
[00:13:20] this at yc quite a bit
[00:13:22] is
[00:13:24] this um anxious
[00:13:26] personality type versus avoid into
[00:13:28] personality type you know when people
[00:13:30] are challenged people are frustrated
[00:13:32] and this is way oversimplification but
[00:13:34] sometimes people are anxious they want
[00:13:35] to deal with the problem right now
[00:13:36] they're leaning in they want to talk for
[00:13:38] they've talked for two hours with you
[00:13:40] and they won't talk for another two
[00:13:41] hours with you
[00:13:42] and sometimes people are avoidant and
[00:13:45] you know after five minutes they're done
[00:13:47] they they want to think about it for a
[00:13:49] long time they rather talk
[00:13:50] asynchronously and i actually see that
[00:13:53] most
[00:13:54] problems between co-founders
[00:13:57] the root cause isn't whatever went wrong
[00:14:00] or whatever they're debating
[00:14:01] it's actually their style of dealing
[00:14:04] with their frustration
[00:14:06] and if you can have a little empathy if
[00:14:08] the person
[00:14:09] who you're working with has a different
[00:14:10] style of dealing with frustration than
[00:14:12] you do
[00:14:13] and you can just take a beat right i'm
[00:14:15] the i'm the anxious type you know this
[00:14:16] dalton like i'm super i want to like
[00:14:18] talk about it for six hours then six
[00:14:20] more hours i want to plan i want to
[00:14:21] write it down
[00:14:23] right now go go go go
[00:14:26] and
[00:14:28] i always get into trouble when i'm
[00:14:29] interacting with someone who
[00:14:32] reacts negatively to that and i always
[00:14:33] have to kind of be like i gotta
[00:14:35] take a beat like in this situation i
[00:14:36] gotta take a beat
[00:14:38] and so
[00:14:39] in my experience
[00:14:41] if you can figure out that dance with
[00:14:43] your co-founder
[00:14:45] it's so much more helpful when you're
[00:14:46] dealing with these external challenges
[00:14:47] and like the startup's going to present
[00:14:49] many opportunities for frustration with
[00:14:50] your co-founder
[00:14:52] infinite opportunities
[00:14:53] it's like the whole topic today which is
[00:14:56] eventually you're going to take punches
[00:14:57] you're going to have set back to your
[00:14:58] startup
[00:14:59] eventually you're going to have conflict
[00:15:01] to the co-founder 100
[00:15:03] 100 like like and the thing that you're
[00:15:06] disagreeing about isn't even the thing
[00:15:08] like who cares it's noise
[00:15:10] right like oh it's like roommates oh did
[00:15:13] you take did you put the dishes away or
[00:15:15] like it's not about the thing and like
[00:15:17] it's not about who's right or who's
[00:15:18] wrong and it's funny because a lot of
[00:15:19] people want to ask us advice
[00:15:21] about co-founder stuff but that what
[00:15:23] they want to what they want is us to
[00:15:25] agree that they were right and their
[00:15:26] co-founder is wrong you love that
[00:15:28] they're wrong dalton can i tell you
[00:15:29] about the situation
[00:15:31] basically
[00:15:32] i'm smart my co-founder is dumb what do
[00:15:35] you think i should do about it like it's
[00:15:36] always and it's like no no no no i'm not
[00:15:38] gonna take debate on that i'm sure
[00:15:41] like the actual
[00:15:43] thing that you need advice on a thing to
[00:15:44] work on is the meta conversation which
[00:15:46] is like how do you deal with conflict
[00:15:50] so that people feel good
[00:15:52] when it's over
[00:15:54] yeah otherwise
[00:15:57] whatever the you know not cleaning up
[00:15:59] your dishes or taking the trash out
[00:16:01] whatever the equivalent of that is in
[00:16:02] your cofounder relationship
[00:16:04] eventually it's not gonna work out man
[00:16:07] right you gotta have tools no because
[00:16:09] there's gonna be more issues
[00:16:12] well i think that's what's fun about
[00:16:13] this what is that like
[00:16:15] early stage founders argue about the
[00:16:17] dumbest things that there's almost
[00:16:18] infinite opportunities to practice this
[00:16:20] dealing with
[00:16:22] frustration of your co-founder like it
[00:16:24] is like a roommate relationship there's
[00:16:25] infinite opportunities before something
[00:16:27] that's a real whammy comes so like
[00:16:29] take those opportunities like
[00:16:32] please take them do you have any more on
[00:16:34] the preventative side before we move the
[00:16:35] treatment i think it's just this
[00:16:37] expectation setting i think so much of
[00:16:38] life is expectation setting where
[00:16:41] setting expectations for yourself set
[00:16:43] expectations for people you work with
[00:16:45] about what to expect
[00:16:47] if you are good at that
[00:16:49] people can deal with all sorts of stuff
[00:16:51] and when you get into the biggest
[00:16:52] trouble both with yourself managing your
[00:16:54] own brain as well as working with other
[00:16:55] people is when you say a bunch of stuff
[00:16:58] that is that turns out to be really not
[00:17:00] true and you set expectations poorly and
[00:17:03] you have to like
[00:17:04] dig yourself out of this deep hole that
[00:17:05] you dug yourself into because you
[00:17:07] promised a bunch of or you set
[00:17:09] expectations in such a way that just
[00:17:10] weren't true
[00:17:11] and so expectation setting is key for
[00:17:13] prevention and you know we talked about
[00:17:15] this in another video but man it's it
[00:17:17] helps to study the real story of
[00:17:20] companies right it helps just to just
[00:17:22] know how long this takes
[00:17:24] man it really helps for you to not have
[00:17:26] stupid expectations oh well this company
[00:17:28] became a billion dollar company in two
[00:17:29] years so that's clearly the average path
[00:17:32] and it's like no like absolutely not
[00:17:35] absolutely not
[00:17:37] it's funny because in some ways you're
[00:17:39] saying sometimes these companies punch
[00:17:41] themselves out right like they don't
[00:17:42] even need external forces they set a
[00:17:44] stupid expectation they don't hit their
[00:17:46] own unrealistic expectation then they
[00:17:47] feel like something's wrong and you're
[00:17:49] just like holy crap you just invented a
[00:17:51] crisis like startups have enough crises
[00:17:53] without that
[00:17:54] well
[00:17:55] we've talked about all the things you
[00:17:57] can do to prevent the injury let's say
[00:18:00] the punch happens bam
[00:18:02] and you need some treatment
[00:18:04] something really bad happens or you
[00:18:06] suspect something really bad happens
[00:18:08] um
[00:18:10] i think the first point that you brought
[00:18:11] up
[00:18:12] that i really love is this idea of like
[00:18:15] do i have to do anything right now
[00:18:18] like
[00:18:19] talk about that a little bit more yeah i
[00:18:21] think i learned this as a founder the
[00:18:23] hard way which is when something bad
[00:18:25] happens you want to immediately
[00:18:28] like
[00:18:29] make a move you want to like call a
[00:18:31] meeting or you want you get a you get an
[00:18:33] email
[00:18:34] with bad news in it you want to hit
[00:18:36] respond and like
[00:18:37] in the moment of fight or flight when
[00:18:39] your adrenaline's pumping you're like
[00:18:41] how dare you sir you know
[00:18:45] you want to
[00:18:46] you want to get start writing emails
[00:18:48] with that tone dear sir
[00:18:51] in response to your query about
[00:18:54] you know like if you're ever typing an
[00:18:57] email with that tone like
[00:18:59] you know don't do it um
[00:19:04] and what i've noticed is you can just
[00:19:05] like
[00:19:06] not respond or like let stuff sit a
[00:19:09] little bit
[00:19:10] and
[00:19:11] sleeping on it is the minimum thing i
[00:19:13] would do this is what i always tell
[00:19:13] founders is when they have something to
[00:19:16] happen to at least sleep on it
[00:19:18] because i just noticed
[00:19:20] the next day
[00:19:22] you have a whole new amount of clarity
[00:19:25] on the situation and i and i often find
[00:19:27] myself in my best moments in my worst
[00:19:29] moments and exactly like you said i'm
[00:19:30] like act now go
[00:19:32] send that email like punch back and my
[00:19:35] best moments i'm always like
[00:19:37] if there's ever a decision that feels
[00:19:39] like it's action one or action two
[00:19:42] there's always a third option which is
[00:19:44] don't act there's all like and it's
[00:19:47] almost never presented to you um i find
[00:19:49] a lot of times lawyers
[00:19:51] companies with this it's like you gotta
[00:19:53] do this or that and it's like it's not
[00:19:54] like
[00:19:55] how about we don't what if we do nothing
[00:19:59] yes
[00:20:00] and then what's really funny is that
[00:20:02] like the best founders
[00:20:04] no action becomes one of their like key
[00:20:07] plays like they use that play way more
[00:20:09] than you think
[00:20:11] it's a great play it's such a good play
[00:20:15] um and it's amazing that like for the
[00:20:18] best founders no action is like you know
[00:20:20] 20 30 40 of the time what they do maybe
[00:20:22] more
[00:20:23] but for other founders they don't even
[00:20:25] know the play exists
[00:20:26] like they don't even know the play
[00:20:28] exists yeah maybe just archive the email
[00:20:30] yeah whatever the email says
[00:20:32] yeah that's true just hit them you know
[00:20:34] it's a really big deal they'll probably
[00:20:35] reply back
[00:20:38] i've noticed that
[00:20:40] it's a really big deal
[00:20:41] um and of course don't do this in the
[00:20:43] case where someone's health is on the
[00:20:44] line or someone's gonna go to jail or
[00:20:46] whatever right that's different but um
[00:20:47] yeah it's more of like
[00:20:49] the stuff
[00:20:50] where someone where it's like
[00:20:52] interpersonal or someone
[00:20:54] i don't know
[00:20:56] yeah someone said something bad
[00:20:58] that you you can't archive you can wait
[00:21:00] till the weekend's over to reply to that
[00:21:02] slack message like it's gonna it'll
[00:21:04] it'll survive so the next one on the
[00:21:06] list is it's okay to take a day off it's
[00:21:09] okay
[00:21:10] to go home
[00:21:12] i think that you know
[00:21:14] there was one moment in my career where
[00:21:18] um we were gonna get bought uh socialcam
[00:21:21] was gonna get bought
[00:21:23] and we were two months into the
[00:21:24] diligence process
[00:21:27] and
[00:21:28] we got a call that said the deal was off
[00:21:32] and it was the only moment in my career
[00:21:34] where i was like
[00:21:35] i'm not going to react to this well in
[00:21:37] front of my co-founders
[00:21:40] i just need to go
[00:21:42] home at least home i can react
[00:21:46] in a way that won't be a bad example to
[00:21:49] them
[00:21:49] you know like because they're going to
[00:21:51] look in my reaction they're going to be
[00:21:52] like are we and if i'm looking
[00:21:54] like we're
[00:21:56] that's not helping you know when the
[00:21:58] generals like pulling their hair being
[00:22:00] like this looks horrible we're gonna die
[00:22:05] that's not good
[00:22:09] um
[00:22:10] and man like going home
[00:22:13] um
[00:22:14] hanging out with you know at the time
[00:22:16] was my girlfriend but then you know
[00:22:18] later became my wife like
[00:22:20] taking that day the next day i could
[00:22:22] kind of bring a better michael to the
[00:22:23] table yeah right
[00:22:25] you know
[00:22:26] that was that was a big thing that was a
[00:22:29] big thing
[00:22:30] um
[00:22:31] i i was thinking about this in the
[00:22:33] context of like
[00:22:34] when things go bad
[00:22:36] there's a current inside a p set of
[00:22:38] people you should probably be hanging
[00:22:39] out with and a certain set of people you
[00:22:40] probably shouldn't be hanging out with
[00:22:42] right like how do you think about that
[00:22:44] yeah i mean again we
[00:22:46] i have my personal experience and i have
[00:22:48] all the data points we have across yc
[00:22:51] founders and you just sometimes see
[00:22:52] people
[00:22:55] that are that are taking punches and
[00:22:56] having a hard time and there's some
[00:22:58] really amazing people that you can hang
[00:23:00] out with that support you and tell you
[00:23:02] you're okay and validate your experience
[00:23:04] and like
[00:23:05] let you take space for yourself and like
[00:23:07] all this good stuff and like these are
[00:23:09] these are great people to have in your
[00:23:10] life and then we see other sorts of
[00:23:12] folks that are like
[00:23:14] you know oh you should do tons of drugs
[00:23:18] um or
[00:23:19] hey like let's go
[00:23:22] not sleep for a really long amount of
[00:23:24] time or let's hang out with celebrities
[00:23:27] or like you know like there's all these
[00:23:29] different crowds you can get into
[00:23:31] and
[00:23:33] it's
[00:23:35] depressing
[00:23:36] how predictive that is for how people
[00:23:38] will deal with like setbacks
[00:23:41] you know yeah even and these are adults
[00:23:42] we're not even talking we're talking
[00:23:43] about
[00:23:44] these are they're adults these are
[00:23:46] our grown people our age people
[00:23:49] still struggle with this particular one
[00:23:52] um and so i think you just want to think
[00:23:53] about
[00:23:55] yeah who who you're spending time with
[00:23:57] when you're
[00:23:58] when you're taking punches and what kind
[00:24:00] of habits that you're taking from the
[00:24:02] peer group you know what man i really
[00:24:05] think that the best people you know i'll
[00:24:07] be explicit right the best people
[00:24:09] goes wrong and they go take a hike or
[00:24:11] something
[00:24:13] and the worst people think goes
[00:24:14] wrong and they drink and do drugs and
[00:24:16] like it tends to be that those friend
[00:24:19] groups
[00:24:20] you know for a lot of founders you know
[00:24:22] the friends who if you go out with them
[00:24:23] you're going to drink and do drugs and
[00:24:25] you know the other friends where if you
[00:24:26] go out then you're going to go on a hike
[00:24:27] like
[00:24:28] just explicit you know and
[00:24:32] you know but pick the right group
[00:24:34] you know pick the right group
[00:24:36] um and it's weird because i don't think
[00:24:38] the friends are bad they're not trying
[00:24:40] to harm you you know
[00:24:42] well they're doing their own thing
[00:24:44] yeah
[00:24:45] um it's just that you know you have to
[00:24:47] choose the right
[00:24:49] therapy
[00:24:51] you have to choose the right therapy for
[00:24:53] yourself and and actually this that's a
[00:24:55] good segue like
[00:24:57] let's talk about real health care let's
[00:24:59] talk about mental health care for a
[00:25:00] second like you know
[00:25:02] this is this is becoming less of a
[00:25:05] controversial issue but i still think
[00:25:07] that it's something that needs to be
[00:25:08] normed more right
[00:25:10] yeah i mean
[00:25:11] therapy is good medication is good if
[00:25:16] you're prescribed it and it's not from
[00:25:17] your friend just kidding um
[00:25:19] [Laughter]
[00:25:21] you know this is
[00:25:23] this stuff is destigmatized and it's
[00:25:25] it's important and like a lot of
[00:25:27] founders struggle i think it's the ups
[00:25:29] and the downs exacerbate this stuff and
[00:25:31] again the stuff i said earlier
[00:25:32] um sleep disruption stress all these
[00:25:34] other things exacerbated so
[00:25:36] you know
[00:25:38] sometimes
[00:25:39] that is the appropriate thing to do here
[00:25:41] so you should
[00:25:42] do it and not think you're too tough or
[00:25:44] whatever whatever reason it would be
[00:25:46] that you wouldn't
[00:25:48] use these things as a crutch i just i've
[00:25:50] noticed that people that aren't
[00:25:53] the people that aren't willing to use
[00:25:54] this stuff they find other crutches that
[00:25:56] yeah i would not do that
[00:25:58] right well and i think that most people
[00:26:01] don't realize this isn't the kind of
[00:26:03] stuff that that comes out in your
[00:26:05] favorite company's press release
[00:26:07] most people don't realize how the
[00:26:08] founders who
[00:26:11] they are impressed with actually take
[00:26:13] advantage of therapy actually take
[00:26:15] advantage of medication
[00:26:16] most people don't realize you know their
[00:26:17] founders i know who've sworn off
[00:26:19] drinking because like they are not
[00:26:22] good you know they they're not the best
[00:26:24] version themselves when they're drinking
[00:26:25] like this isn't the kind of stuff that
[00:26:26] people will talk about very publicly but
[00:26:29] we know a lot of people and
[00:26:31] when someone's trying to squeeze every
[00:26:33] ounce of positive productivity out of
[00:26:35] themselves
[00:26:37] sometimes like you know um
[00:26:41] they need to use these tools and it's
[00:26:42] really helpful
[00:26:44] really really helpful
[00:26:45] so
[00:26:47] you know let's talk about
[00:26:49] the fatal punches right you know why i
[00:26:52] see we do with a lot of failure we deal
[00:26:53] with a lot of companies who fail
[00:26:56] and
[00:26:57] you and i have to have a lot of
[00:26:58] conversations with founders who
[00:27:01] their company has failed and their first
[00:27:04] thought is i'm a failure they
[00:27:05] personalize that failure
[00:27:07] what are the some of the things you tell
[00:27:08] those people when they're dealing with
[00:27:09] that fatal punch
[00:27:11] yeah i think it as per we talked about
[00:27:13] here
[00:27:14] a lot of the things that people think
[00:27:16] are game over aren't and so our advice
[00:27:19] is don't give up like you actually have
[00:27:21] a bunch of customers you have a bunch of
[00:27:23] money like let's look at the facts
[00:27:24] you're good and so a lot of our office
[00:27:26] hours are let's examine the facts
[00:27:29] fact fact fact fact great you're
[00:27:32] fine however
[00:27:35] sometimes we look at the facts and
[00:27:37] you're not fine
[00:27:38] and it doesn't help you
[00:27:40] like you don't need a pep talk to keep
[00:27:42] going
[00:27:44] and
[00:27:44] it actually is probably the right thing
[00:27:47] for you to not keep going
[00:27:49] because at the end of the day
[00:27:51] this is your life you only have one of
[00:27:52] them
[00:27:53] and messing up your life
[00:27:56] in a permanent way
[00:27:58] your savings your family your friends
[00:28:00] whatever it is you know don't do that
[00:28:03] and again i know it can be confusing out
[00:28:04] there because we get bombarded with
[00:28:05] messages oh but you say you never give
[00:28:07] up or you say you know like
[00:28:09] yeah it's confusing it's that easy
[00:28:11] yeah it's complicated yeah complicated
[00:28:14] so i think you need to actually with
[00:28:16] this
[00:28:17] clear objective
[00:28:19] ways as you can be able to know when
[00:28:21] it's not working
[00:28:23] and that it was a fatal punch and that
[00:28:25] yeah you should
[00:28:27] not do this anymore like sometimes
[00:28:29] sometimes you see people get into like
[00:28:32] debt where they owe a bunch of people a
[00:28:34] lot of money and then they shut down and
[00:28:36] they ripped off all their suppliers
[00:28:38] again you know you know what i'm trying
[00:28:39] to say like like you could you fail in
[00:28:42] such a way that you hurt a bunch of
[00:28:44] people not just yourself
[00:28:46] not good don't do that when i think that
[00:28:49] this is what's tricky is that i think
[00:28:51] someone needs to be out there saying
[00:28:52] that these aren't the things you have to
[00:28:54] put on the table to win
[00:28:56] yes when you're working hard you're
[00:28:58] gonna probably have to spend less time
[00:28:59] with your family or friends but you
[00:29:01] don't have to put those relationships
[00:29:02] you don't have to sacrifice those
[00:29:04] relationships to win in fact they're a
[00:29:05] source of strength you're working hard
[00:29:07] you're probably not saving as much money
[00:29:09] as you would be if you're working
[00:29:10] another job but you don't have to
[00:29:12] sacrifice all your savings you don't
[00:29:13] have to go into extreme debt
[00:29:16] like
[00:29:17] if you're working hard like
[00:29:19] you might not be able to get the salary
[00:29:21] that allows you to live in the apartment
[00:29:22] of your dreams
[00:29:23] but like if you have to crash on friends
[00:29:26] couches
[00:29:27] these things
[00:29:29] don't tend to have to be sacrificed to
[00:29:31] win and so if you're if you're taking
[00:29:33] these kind of one-way hard
[00:29:36] life hits
[00:29:38] maybe the facts are are set up yeah and
[00:29:40] again what's tough
[00:29:42] is when you're one of those folks
[00:29:43] sometimes you can even be victimized by
[00:29:45] people that'll like
[00:29:48] keep
[00:29:49] bleeding you because that's the racket
[00:29:51] and we see this a lot with struggling
[00:29:53] startups all sorts of people will come
[00:29:55] out of the woodwork to sell you services
[00:29:58] or promise they'll connect with the
[00:29:59] investors or they'll help you fundraise
[00:30:01] or you name it
[00:30:02] and it's like it's kind of like
[00:30:05] moving to hollywood to become an actor
[00:30:06] and it's not going well all these people
[00:30:08] will
[00:30:09] like there's a whole underbelly of folks
[00:30:12] who exist to sell stuff rip off the
[00:30:14] people who aren't doing well
[00:30:17] you know to me
[00:30:18] where i see this happen that's most
[00:30:20] tragic is with non-technical founders
[00:30:22] because it'll be some dev shop or some
[00:30:25] you know
[00:30:27] if you give me your last dollar i
[00:30:29] promise that
[00:30:31] i'll solve your problem
[00:30:33] yeah you see people
[00:30:34] writing checks for
[00:30:36] 20 30 40 what are 50 grand out of their
[00:30:39] personal checking account their life
[00:30:40] savings to some dev shop yes that's like
[00:30:42] their whole business model is to rip i
[00:30:44] shouldn't say rip but like they're like
[00:30:46] yeah cool like whatever like just as
[00:30:48] long as the check clears we'll do it you
[00:30:50] know yeah it's pretty depressing
[00:30:52] that's really depressing
[00:30:53] and and i think that like
[00:30:55] those founders when we have this
[00:30:57] conversation be like hey
[00:31:00] your startup failed that doesn't mean
[00:31:02] you failed you know sometimes they just
[00:31:05] need to hear someone say that like
[00:31:08] so often
[00:31:09] we'll talk about like look at this
[00:31:11] person they're sort of fail and they
[00:31:12] have another one that does well look at
[00:31:13] this person they should have failed and
[00:31:14] they're not working as an executive at
[00:31:16] this really cool company like these
[00:31:18] experiences you have
[00:31:20] are valuable to you even if your company
[00:31:22] didn't work you know
[00:31:24] you learned 10x more than you would have
[00:31:26] learned otherwise even if your company
[00:31:27] didn't work
[00:31:28] and sometimes when we explain that
[00:31:30] silver lining people are like oh
[00:31:32] you're right
[00:31:33] you know
[00:31:35] that's actually a fun part of the job
[00:31:36] so there you go
[00:31:38] step one how to try to avoid the punches
[00:31:41] or step two when they come
[00:31:44] how to recover as fast as possible
[00:31:46] great shine today dalton thanks man
