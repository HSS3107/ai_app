[00:00:07] podcast by night all
[00:00:11] day all right we're rolling good to see
[00:00:14] you sir here we
[00:00:16] go um one of the things I wanted to talk
[00:00:18] to you about I wanted to play this but
[00:00:21] we decided we shouldn't play it because
[00:00:23] uh it could get copyright strike and we
[00:00:25] don't want to get the episode we don't
[00:00:27] want anybody to have any sort of a way
[00:00:29] to get it down sure but it was the
[00:00:32] episode of you when you're on The View
[00:00:34] and I think it was 2015 or6 like when
[00:00:38] you were running for president right and
[00:00:41] you sat you got introduced as our friend
[00:00:44] Donald Trump that's right whoopy
[00:00:46] Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss
[00:00:48] Joy bayar gives you a big hug Barbara
[00:00:51] Walters gives you a big hug they all
[00:00:53] loved you they were all talking about
[00:00:56] how your uh you might be
[00:01:00] you might be conservative in your
[00:01:03] financial positions but you're very
[00:01:05] liberal socially they were they're
[00:01:07] talking about you in such a favorable
[00:01:09] light the audience was
[00:01:12] cheering and then you actually started
[00:01:14] winning in the polls and then the
[00:01:16] machine started working towards you yeah
[00:01:19] but it's there's probably no one in
[00:01:22] history that I've ever seen that's been
[00:01:25] attacked the way you've been attacked
[00:01:27] and the way they've done it so coord at
[00:01:30] and systematically when you see those
[00:01:32] same people in the past very favorable
[00:01:34] to you like Oprah when you were on Oprah
[00:01:36] Show she was encouraging you last week I
[00:01:39] did one of our last shows I think maybe
[00:01:41] Thursday or Friday that was a big deal
[00:01:43] being on Oprah's show the last one and I
[00:01:45] was like one of the last shows in that
[00:01:47] last that final week and I said boy
[00:01:50] we've come a long way since since that
[00:01:53] what was it like uh well the concept it
[00:01:56] was really like two different lives you
[00:01:58] know I had a a very wonderful life but I
[00:02:01] I wanted to do this The Apprentice was
[00:02:02] still going very strong we had 12
[00:02:05] seasons and uh we had actually uh 14
[00:02:09] Seasons 12 years over they had a couple
[00:02:11] of well they canceled the Apprentice
[00:02:12] when you were running for president
[00:02:14] correct no they had Arnold SCH a
[00:02:16] do it I was involved in that and I want
[00:02:19] I I had enough of it and we did great it
[00:02:21] was doing great but they wanted me to
[00:02:24] stay they all came to see me they said
[00:02:26] we're going to give you a contract they
[00:02:27] wanted to extend my contract Mark
[00:02:29] Bernett is a great guy and they wanted
[00:02:31] to extend the contract Mark said you're
[00:02:33] crazy don't run don't run no nobody
[00:02:36] gives up prime time they said you know
[00:02:37] it's one of those little things which is
[00:02:39] probably true nobody gives a prime time
[00:02:41] though for being president for for
[00:02:43] running well for running against 20 some
[00:02:46] people you know turned out to be 18 18
[00:02:49] professional people you know mostly
[00:02:50] politicians they said who would do this
[00:02:53] I mean it's a long shot actually the
[00:02:54] heads of NBC came over the uh Paul tgy
[00:02:58] all the all the top people came over to
[00:03:00] see me try and talk me out of it because
[00:03:01] they wanted to have me extend The
[00:03:03] Apprentice was doing well so it was 14
[00:03:06] Seasons it was 12 years we had one two
[00:03:09] seasons where we had a double which
[00:03:11] rarely happens it was just a hot show
[00:03:13] and uh I said you know I want to do this
[00:03:16] what happened is uh previously like
[00:03:19] three years four years before that they
[00:03:21] did a poll they had Mitt Romney and
[00:03:23] somehow they put me in a poll and I blew
[00:03:26] everybody away I blew him away which
[00:03:28] isn't that hard frankly but I blew
[00:03:30] everybody away and I said that's
[00:03:31] interesting because I never really gave
[00:03:33] it that much real thought I thought
[00:03:35] about it but never real thought but I
[00:03:36] saw these polls were very good and so I
[00:03:39] was thinking about doing it then but I
[00:03:40] had a contract with the Apprentice plus
[00:03:42] I was building two big buildings at the
[00:03:44] time and I wanted to make sure they got
[00:03:45] finished up properly and it was one of
[00:03:47] those things the kids were just sort of
[00:03:49] getting involved they're very capable
[00:03:51] kids but they were getting involved
[00:03:52] early on so I did that I got them done I
[00:03:55] had some very good successes and I came
[00:03:58] on and then I thought about it for the
[00:04:00] next one after the Romney disaster and I
[00:04:04] ran and I won against Hillary it was
[00:04:07] quite an experience but it was a
[00:04:09] different life because you're right the
[00:04:11] view I was on The View many many times
[00:04:13] and uh they loved me just the way people
[00:04:16] would talk I mean even if people had
[00:04:17] criticisms about you people that didn't
[00:04:19] like you there was always feuds and
[00:04:21] stuff like that but the reality was the
[00:04:24] thing turned on you when they found out
[00:04:26] that you were going to be president it
[00:04:27] was very coordinated and some people are
[00:04:30] catching on to that now there's a lot of
[00:04:32] people that were longtime Democrats like
[00:04:34] Elon and Bill Amman and all these
[00:04:37] different very intelligent people and
[00:04:38] they support me now Bill supports me
[00:04:40] he's been very supportive too what this
[00:04:42] is what I wanted to ask you what was it
[00:04:45] like when you actually got in CU nobody
[00:04:47] really can prepare you for that when
[00:04:49] you're running for president you don't
[00:04:50] really know what it's going to be like
[00:04:52] when you actually get into office what
[00:04:54] was the what did you think it was going
[00:04:56] to be like in office or when I decided
[00:04:58] to run so no when you got in when I was
[00:05:00] in so when I was in and one and was in
[00:05:03] the White House essentially well first
[00:05:06] of all it was very surreal oh you know
[00:05:08] it's very interesting when I got shot it
[00:05:10] wasn't surreal that should have been
[00:05:12] surreal when I was laying on the ground
[00:05:13] I knew exactly what was going on I knew
[00:05:15] exactly where I was hit they were saying
[00:05:18] you were hit all over the place because
[00:05:20] there was so much blood from the ear you
[00:05:22] would know that better than anyone when
[00:05:23] they get the ear torn up ear bleed a lot
[00:05:25] bleed anyway so and and I was thinking
[00:05:29] the other day
[00:05:30] when when that happened I really knew
[00:05:32] where I was I knew exactly what happened
[00:05:35] I said I wasn't hit anywhere else with
[00:05:37] the with the presidency it was a very
[00:05:40] surreal experience okay and what's day
[00:05:43] one like you win you get inaugurated
[00:05:46] holy I'm the president yeah that's
[00:05:48] what happened so I'm driving down
[00:05:49] Pennsylvania Avenue I just built a
[00:05:51] building on pen you know the hotel the
[00:05:53] old post office it was we called it
[00:05:55] Trump
[00:05:56] National uh hotel and we sold it to the
[00:06:00] Waldorf Historia and it was a wonderful
[00:06:03] thing but I'm driving down I'm passing
[00:06:04] the hotel you've never seen so many
[00:06:07] motorcycles police
[00:06:09] military you know it was a major thing I
[00:06:12] got off really the first time I used Air
[00:06:15] Force One landed and we're coming down
[00:06:18] and they were it was very be I mean it
[00:06:21] was incredible and we're going down
[00:06:23] Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite
[00:06:24] direction you know normally you're used
[00:06:26] to going one way and all of a sudden
[00:06:28] you're going the other way the street
[00:06:30] was loaded up and I wanted to go out and
[00:06:33] I wanted to wave to everybody but that
[00:06:35] wasn't smart you know that KS a little
[00:06:38] bit dangerous right I mean when you
[00:06:40] watch like Kennedy and some others right
[00:06:43] but I really felt I don't know the love
[00:06:45] was so crazy and so I did get out of the
[00:06:49] car for a brief you know just for a very
[00:06:50] short walk I thought it was very
[00:06:52] important to do and milania got out with
[00:06:54] her beautiful dress on that became sort
[00:06:56] of a staple it was uh people loved it
[00:06:59] and
[00:07:00] Baron and we're walking down the street
[00:07:03] but where it really got amazing we get
[00:07:06] to the White House and now it's a little
[00:07:09] bit uh little bit before dark
[00:07:11] beautiful and we went up to the
[00:07:14] president's quarters they call them the
[00:07:16] presidential quarters and I'm standing
[00:07:20] in this beautiful hallway I you know
[00:07:22] it's funny nobody ever talks about the
[00:07:24] White House as being beautiful inside
[00:07:26] you know you think it's going to be
[00:07:27] everything's going to be all metal doors
[00:07:29] and stuff it's not it's so beautiful I
[00:07:32] made my money largely on luxury the
[00:07:35] hallway is like 25 ft wide the ceiling
[00:07:38] Heights are you every it's so beautiful
[00:07:41] but I was standing there and I said to
[00:07:44] the guys I want to see the Lincoln
[00:07:45] bedroom I had never seen the Lincoln
[00:07:47] bedroom I'd heard about the Lincoln
[00:07:49] bedroom and I was standing with my wife
[00:07:53] I said Do you believe it this is the
[00:07:54] Lincoln bedroom I mean it was like it
[00:07:59] was it was amazing because it's look if
[00:08:03] you love the country but here you are
[00:08:05] the Lincoln bedroom and the bed you know
[00:08:08] he was very tall he was 6'6 which then
[00:08:10] would be like like Baron right would be
[00:08:13] like Baron Trump he's 69 but 6'6 he was
[00:08:18] very tall then on top of that he wore
[00:08:19] there it is he wore that yeah there it
[00:08:21] is it's a long bed elongated bed and
[00:08:24] because very you know people were
[00:08:26] shorter than you see some of the chairs
[00:08:28] are very very low to the ground actually
[00:08:31] but he had the long bed and they had uh
[00:08:35] you had the Gettysburg Address right on
[00:08:37] that right under that you can't see it
[00:08:39] here but right there the original
[00:08:40] version of the Gettysburg address and
[00:08:43] this is the original and I'm looking and
[00:08:45] I just looked around I said Do you
[00:08:48] believe this because I was never a pol
[00:08:51] first of even if you were a politician
[00:08:52] but I was never a politician it just I
[00:08:54] sort of just started right and all of a
[00:08:57] sudden I'm standing in the White House
[00:08:58] and it was uh very very surreal that
[00:09:01] room was so beautiful to me much more
[00:09:03] beautiful than it actually is you know
[00:09:05] to me when I looked at the bed and the
[00:09:07] bed you could see was a little bit
[00:09:08] longer had to be a little bit longer uh
[00:09:11] he lost his son and they suffered the
[00:09:14] two of them suffered from melancolia
[00:09:16] they didn't call it depression they
[00:09:18] called it melancolia and they suffered
[00:09:21] from it he was a very depressed guy and
[00:09:24] she was a very depressed woman more so
[00:09:27] than him and on top of that they lost
[00:09:29] their son whose name was Tad Tad and uh
[00:09:35] it was uh just seeing it in the little
[00:09:38] picture a little tiny picture I mean you
[00:09:40] can't see the details there little tiny
[00:09:42] everything the W was a little tiny
[00:09:44] picture of Tad who he lost and it was
[00:09:49] devastating and he was you know he was a
[00:09:52] look he was in a war he was he and he
[00:09:55] was having a hard time because he
[00:09:56] couldn't beat Robert E Lee Robert E Lee
[00:09:58] won like 13 battles in a row and he was
[00:10:01] getting like a phobia like a fighter you
[00:10:03] know a lot about the fight stuff but
[00:10:06] like I went to a UFC fight and it was a
[00:10:11] champion who was 14- one about a year
[00:10:14] ago you would know the names 14 and one
[00:10:17] and the only guy he lost to was this one
[00:10:18] guy but the guy that he was fighting was
[00:10:21] like almost just an average fighter lost
[00:10:24] numerous times but he beat this one guy
[00:10:27] so I said okay I really don't know who
[00:10:29] you're talking abouty I I will figure it
[00:10:31] out okay but about a year ago but the
[00:10:33] point is that he lost he wasn't nearly
[00:10:35] the fighter as the but the one who was
[00:10:38] not nearly the fighter had beaten he's
[00:10:40] the only guy that beat the the champ
[00:10:42] like five years before and I said I'll
[00:10:45] take the guy that won the other fight
[00:10:47] and that's what happened he beat him a
[00:10:48] second time sometimes psychological
[00:10:50] advantage is this crazy thing uh Lincoln
[00:10:54] had a I don't know I've never read this
[00:10:56] I heard it from people in the way house
[00:11:00] who really understand what was going on
[00:11:02] with with the whole life of the White
[00:11:04] House but Lincoln had uh The Yips about
[00:11:08] in a way as the golfers would say he had
[00:11:10] a phobia about Robert El Lee said I
[00:11:12] can't beat Robert because Robert E Lee
[00:11:15] won many battles in a row he was just
[00:11:17] beating the hell out of you know they
[00:11:18] tried to get Robert Elite to be on the
[00:11:20] north but he said no I have to be with
[00:11:22] my state you know the state was his
[00:11:24] whole thing and and he went to the South
[00:11:27] and he was uh I've had generals tell me
[00:11:30] we have some great generals the real
[00:11:31] generals not the ones you see on
[00:11:32] television the ones that beat Isis with
[00:11:35] me we defeated Isis and record time it
[00:11:37] was supposed to take years and we did it
[00:11:40] in a matter of weeks he's are great
[00:11:42] generals he's a tough guys he's a not
[00:11:44] woke guys but their favorite General in
[00:11:48] terms of Genius was Robert El Le
[00:11:51] strategy strategy strategically he took
[00:11:53] a war that should have been over in a
[00:11:56] few days and it was you know years of
[00:11:59] head hell a vicious war and um so here I
[00:12:04] am standing there and again I had never
[00:12:08] really done this before you know I ran I
[00:12:09] ran a number of months before I won I
[00:12:13] probably uh I guess if you figured Max
[00:12:16] it out it would be a year something like
[00:12:19] that so I had never run for office and I
[00:12:22] did well I mean I I went into debates we
[00:12:25] had 18 people including me and then
[00:12:27] slowly but surely they started to
[00:12:29] disappear we had debates good debates
[00:12:32] everyone's aware of all this stuff but
[00:12:33] what I want to get to is like what was
[00:12:34] the experience once you got inside like
[00:12:37] what did you think it was going to be
[00:12:38] like in terms of like your ability to
[00:12:40] govern like this is your first
[00:12:42] experience governing anything you never
[00:12:44] been a govern you never been a mayor
[00:12:46] private private stuff business but now
[00:12:49] all of a sudden you're inside the White
[00:12:50] House the biggest thing was just that
[00:12:52] first moment of being in this hallowed
[00:12:55] it was really a hallowed place to me it
[00:12:57] was it was beyond to me that's that was
[00:12:59] the experience it was a surreal
[00:13:01] experience and then with time that wears
[00:13:05] off with time it becomes you know your
[00:13:07] place where you stay and right uh I was
[00:13:10] doing a lot of I was I had two things
[00:13:13] that I really focused on governing the
[00:13:15] country and uh
[00:13:18] survival because from the moment I won
[00:13:22] before I got to office all of a sudden
[00:13:24] it I mean they came down I mean nobody
[00:13:27] has ever been treated that way
[00:13:30] and and you see that I mean you see
[00:13:31] we're in the Washington Post very early
[00:13:33] on they said well now the impeachment
[00:13:35] stuff starts and it did I mean it
[00:13:36] literally started from the beginning so
[00:13:38] I had survival and run the nation I had
[00:13:40] a a combination most people don't have
[00:13:42] the survival they get in uh what did you
[00:13:46] expect though in terms of like once you
[00:13:48] got inside you had to appoint all these
[00:13:50] people like how many appointments did
[00:13:52] you have to make you have you actually
[00:13:54] 10,000 uh appointments now they're
[00:13:57] different you know you have big ones and
[00:13:58] then they appoint right 100 people and
[00:14:00] 200 people and but the president really
[00:14:03] is is involved with approximately 10,000
[00:14:06] appointments so you'll appoint a
[00:14:08] secretary of state and he will he or she
[00:14:10] will appoint a lot of people so it's a
[00:14:11] lot but in terms of major ones you
[00:14:14] probably have like a h 100 but they're
[00:14:15] big ones uh treasury State uh military
[00:14:21] and how did you know who to a point well
[00:14:24] I I didn't I had no experience you have
[00:14:26] to understand I was there 17 times in
[00:14:29] Washington and I never stayed over
[00:14:31] according to the Press which I think is
[00:14:32] probably right over the years I was only
[00:14:35] there 17 times I never stayed over so
[00:14:38] now I'm sitting there I'm saying this
[00:14:41] place is gorgeous but you know I don't
[00:14:42] know anybody it's like you you you know
[00:14:44] you go to certain areas and other areas
[00:14:47] they may be great Washington was great
[00:14:49] Washington's not so great right now
[00:14:51] they're got to we got to fix it we got
[00:14:52] to make it better very dangerous place
[00:14:54] very badly maintained place we're going
[00:14:57] to make it great we're going to make it
[00:14:58] better better we're going to bring it
[00:14:59] back but I wasn't a Washington guy I was
[00:15:02] a New York guy I was a New York Builder
[00:15:04] and I I built buildings in New York and
[00:15:06] I knew that whole world but I didn't
[00:15:08] know the Washington world too well and
[00:15:10] all of a sudden you're supposed to be
[00:15:12] appointing top people so what did you
[00:15:14] think it was going to be like versus
[00:15:16] like did you have any ideas of what it
[00:15:17] was going to be like and what was
[00:15:19] different well I was always involved in
[00:15:21] politics but usually from the standpoint
[00:15:22] of of a donor I was a donor you know I
[00:15:24] was a big donor I gave money to
[00:15:26] politicians I enjoyed Poli rats right a
[00:15:30] de both really pretty much both I have
[00:15:32] actually pictures of Ronald Reagan and
[00:15:34] me when I was very young you were a
[00:15:35] Democrat until like what year uh I was a
[00:15:38] Democrat um I could get you the exact
[00:15:42] but the the early 90s the early 90s I I
[00:15:46] switched over eventually actually uh
[00:15:48] they had a reform party I was thinking
[00:15:50] about doing that for a little while but
[00:15:51] then fortunately I didn't because it's
[00:15:53] very hard you know it's a two-party
[00:15:55] system and anytime you hear third party
[00:15:57] I know you like RF K junr and so do I
[00:16:00] he's a fantastic gu I do but I thought
[00:16:01] that being an independent was nonsense
[00:16:03] it doesn't work it doesn't work because
[00:16:05] even if you do great you're not going to
[00:16:07] get Congress in other words you need now
[00:16:10] to say okay now I'll get half of
[00:16:11] Congress never going to vote for you so
[00:16:13] even if you got there which is very hard
[00:16:16] and but and I know how you feel about
[00:16:19] Bobby and I feel the same way and he's
[00:16:21] now with us but it it doesn't it's real
[00:16:23] it's pure and simple it's a two-party
[00:16:25] system right and uh somebody I won't
[00:16:28] mention his name but somebody spent $250
[00:16:30] million trying to get the nomination as
[00:16:32] a Reform Party candidate or whatever and
[00:16:35] they got just nowhere you get eaten you
[00:16:37] just get eaten the system eats you alive
[00:16:40] right so uh so it was it was really
[00:16:44] somebody that Not only was new to
[00:16:46] Washington but was new to
[00:16:48] politics so in in the office of the
[00:16:54] presidency over the years all those
[00:16:56] presidents you've had 92 2% were
[00:17:00] politicians and 8% were Generals General
[00:17:03] Eisenhower General Washington right
[00:17:05] General George Washington he had
[00:17:06] generals so it's 8% no Admirals 8%
[00:17:10] generals and 92% politicians you know
[00:17:13] they're politicians and they go on so
[00:17:15] they never had a business guy or they
[00:17:17] never had a guy that wasn't elected to
[00:17:19] an office um they were all like Ronald
[00:17:21] Reagan was really he was a movie actor
[00:17:23] and then but he became the governor of
[00:17:25] California for I think two terms and
[00:17:27] then he ran
[00:17:29] uh so you'd never had a thing like this
[00:17:31] but I you know in terms of me and some
[00:17:34] sometimes i' use it as an excuse and I
[00:17:37] don't like having excuses actually but
[00:17:39] I'd use it as an excuse I had to rely on
[00:17:42] people that I respected or liked but
[00:17:45] that I didn't know that well because I
[00:17:47] didn't know them that well some of those
[00:17:49] people I campaigned against because you
[00:17:51] know when you have 18 people we had
[00:17:52] mostly politicians running in the
[00:17:54] election you know running in the
[00:17:56] primaries and they got knocked out one
[00:17:58] by one but I got to like some of them
[00:18:00] some of them I didn't like at all and I
[00:18:02] don't like them now and I'd rely on them
[00:18:05] and I'd rely on other people so all of a
[00:18:07] sudden people would come in I'd like to
[00:18:08] recommend so and so to be Secretary of
[00:18:11] State and I'd have three four people
[00:18:13] recomend one thing I can tell you
[00:18:15] everybody wants the position of course
[00:18:17] no no but sometimes I'll hear a lot of
[00:18:20] people don't want to work with Trump
[00:18:21] because Trump is tough to work with Etc
[00:18:23] let me tell you everybody wants to be
[00:18:26] any one of these positions they die for
[00:18:28] it of course now they don't want to be
[00:18:29] known I mean there's a particular guy in
[00:18:33] uh New York primarily very big very big
[00:18:37] very successful very uh very strong very
[00:18:40] political although he's not a politician
[00:18:43] he'd give anything to be Secretary of
[00:18:45] State but if they ask him no I don't
[00:18:47] think I would do it but in the
[00:18:49] meantime begging for it okay begging
[00:18:52] they all I believe everybody look
[00:18:53] everybody wants it but my by the way no
[00:18:56] matter what you do every but it's very
[00:18:59] dangerous to pick somebody outside of a
[00:19:00] politician because a politician's been
[00:19:02] basically vetted for years right you
[00:19:04] pick a business guy and they've never
[00:19:07] been vetted at all and they're you know
[00:19:09] the head of a big company or something
[00:19:10] but they've never been vetted you know
[00:19:12] nothing about his personal life you know
[00:19:14] nothing about where he's been when you
[00:19:16] put him in it's a little bit dangerous
[00:19:18] because all of a sudden they get checked
[00:19:20] up and you hear things that you're
[00:19:21] saying wow this is not going to work out
[00:19:23] too well so it's very dangerous picking
[00:19:26] picking people that are outside of
[00:19:28] politics is somewhat dangerous so you're
[00:19:30] kind of stuck in a position we have to
[00:19:32] pick established people then the problem
[00:19:34] with established people is established
[00:19:35] people are already indoctrinated into
[00:19:37] the system and they're stiffs in many
[00:19:39] cases stiffs they're survivors I find
[00:19:43] that you know what do you mean by stiffs
[00:19:45] when you say stiffs stiff they don't
[00:19:46] they don't have nothing they have
[00:19:48] nothing
[00:19:49] or they're smart and survival one one
[00:19:52] little thing so there was a congressman
[00:19:53] years before I ran and I was very close
[00:19:56] to him and I needed a license on
[00:19:59] something and he was very important in
[00:20:00] getting the license but it was a little
[00:20:02] bit controversial the license this
[00:20:04] particular thing that was being licensed
[00:20:07] but I was close to this guy and helped
[00:20:09] him and everything else and I went to
[00:20:11] him I said I'd like to have you help and
[00:20:13] he said uh let me take a look at it I
[00:20:17] said oh that's not too good uh but I
[00:20:20] really hope you're going to help and
[00:20:21] anyway he tapped me along for a long
[00:20:22] period of time and ultimately didn't do
[00:20:24] it and I said you are a stiff you could
[00:20:26] have done this thing so easy Etc but it
[00:20:28] was controversial he was in Congress for
[00:20:31] many years like 28 years and you know
[00:20:33] there's a reason when somebody's there
[00:20:35] for 28 years you got to be S of smart
[00:20:37] you know you have all scals and I
[00:20:40] realized he was a Survivor and so they
[00:20:42] never do anything controversial they
[00:20:44] never take any chances or speak their
[00:20:46] opinion that's outside of the yeah and
[00:20:49] yet I don't disrespect him for it I
[00:20:51] actually respected the guy more than a
[00:20:52] in a certain way I said survive you know
[00:20:54] what he's been there like for 28 years
[00:20:58] and he made it through a lot of people
[00:20:59] don't make it through it's a good way
[00:21:01] for non-exceptional people to survive
[00:21:03] well it is I mean it certainly is so
[00:21:05] you're you're in there you have 10,000
[00:21:08] appointments you have to make like so
[00:21:10] you're getting advice from people and it
[00:21:12] at one point in time did you have a
[00:21:13] moment in time where you realize like
[00:21:16] these are bad choices like some of these
[00:21:18] people I shouldn't have had in there oh
[00:21:20] yeah I think so the one question that
[00:21:22] you'll ask me that I think you'll ask me
[00:21:25] that see people seem to ask and I always
[00:21:27] come up with the same answer
[00:21:29] uh if I I the one mistake cuz I did I
[00:21:32] had a lot of success great economy great
[00:21:34] everything everything was great we the
[00:21:37] military we rebuilt it biggest tax cuts
[00:21:39] in history all this stuff we did we had
[00:21:42] a great presidency uh three Supreme
[00:21:44] Court Justices most people get none you
[00:21:46] know you pick them young this way
[00:21:49] they're there for 50 years right so you
[00:21:51] know even if a president is there for
[00:21:53] eight years often times they never have
[00:21:55] a chance I had three it was sort of the
[00:21:57] luck of the draw but
[00:21:59] uh I I will say that it always comes
[00:22:01] back to the same
[00:22:03] answer the biggest mistake I made was I
[00:22:05] picked some people I picked some great
[00:22:07] people you know but you don't think
[00:22:09] about that I picked some people that I
[00:22:12] shouldn't have picked I picked a few
[00:22:14] people that I shouldn't have picked and
[00:22:18] neocons yeah neocons or bad people or
[00:22:20] disloyal people or people that were just
[00:22:24] people that were into the got bad advice
[00:22:26] yeah I mean look I mean you reading
[00:22:27] about them a little little bit today a
[00:22:30] guy like Kelly who is a bully a bully
[00:22:32] but a weak a weak person you know you
[00:22:34] know more about bullies than anybody
[00:22:35] probably around cuz you deal in a a
[00:22:37] certain sport where the bullies are
[00:22:39] exposed very quickly yeah but you know
[00:22:42] uh he's bad uh Bolton was an idiot but
[00:22:45] he was great for me because I'd go in
[00:22:47] with a guy like a John Bolton you know
[00:22:49] John Bolton a friend of mine called
[00:22:51] called me up I was picking Bolton and
[00:22:53] he's a very smart guy his name is Phil
[00:22:55] Ruff and he's a very rich guy from Las
[00:22:57] Vegas one of the he a great card player
[00:23:00] he doesn't play cards but he's a great
[00:23:01] play you know he's just a natural got
[00:23:04] poker sense right you know the good old
[00:23:06] poker sense and Phil Ruffin is is a very
[00:23:09] very wise kind of a guy and very one of
[00:23:13] the richest people around and has had
[00:23:16] great success and understands people so
[00:23:19] it was in that I was picking Bolton or I
[00:23:21] picked Bolton he called up he said don't
[00:23:23] pick him well he's a bad guy I've now he
[00:23:26] wasn't in politics at all he in various
[00:23:29] businesses he said he's a bad guy he's
[00:23:33] just it always works out bad with that
[00:23:36] guy I said oh man I wish you told me
[00:23:38] this two weeks ago I already hired him
[00:23:40] you know he's here and and he was right
[00:23:43] but but he was good in a certain way
[00:23:46] he's a nut job and every time I had to
[00:23:49] deal with the country when they saw this
[00:23:53] wack job standing behind me they said oh
[00:23:56] man Trump's going to go to war with him
[00:23:58] this he was with Bush when they went
[00:24:00] stupidly into the Middle East they
[00:24:01] should have never done it I used to say
[00:24:03] it as a civilian so I always got more
[00:24:06] publicity than other people and I didn't
[00:24:08] it wasn't like I was trying in fact I
[00:24:11] don't know exactly why maybe you can
[00:24:13] tell me when I could definitely tell you
[00:24:15] he said a lot of wild
[00:24:17] maybe maybe he said a lot of wild
[00:24:20] and then CNN in their all their
[00:24:22] brilliance by highlighting your wild
[00:24:24]  made you much more popular yeah and
[00:24:27] they boosted you in the PO cuz people
[00:24:28] were tired of someone talking in this
[00:24:32]  pre-prepared politician lingo
[00:24:36] and even if they didn't agree with you
[00:24:37] they at least knew whoever that guy is
[00:24:40] that's him that's really him when you
[00:24:42] see certain people talk certain people
[00:24:44] in the public eye you don't know who
[00:24:46] they are you have no idea who they are
[00:24:48] it's very difficult to know you see them
[00:24:50] in conversations they have these
[00:24:51] pre-planned answers they say everything
[00:24:53] it's very rehearsed you never get to the
[00:24:56] meat of it what the one of the beautiful
[00:24:58] things about you is that you free ball
[00:25:00] like you get out and you do these huge
[00:25:03] events and you're just talking and
[00:25:04] you're making we we've highlighted you
[00:25:06] on the show many times where when you
[00:25:08] did this Biden impression where he's
[00:25:09] walking around he doesn't know what he's
[00:25:10] doing it's funny it's it's standup it's
[00:25:12] funny stuff but it's like you and you
[00:25:15] were making fun of Elon one time you
[00:25:16] doing an Elon impression it's great you
[00:25:19] you have like comedic instincts like
[00:25:21] when you said to Hillary you'd be in
[00:25:22] jail like that's great timing yeah but
[00:25:25] it's like that kind of stuff was unheard
[00:25:27] of as a politician like no one had done
[00:25:30] that and I think you know what's funny
[00:25:32] you need at least the attitude of a
[00:25:35] comedian when you're doing this business
[00:25:38] this is a very dangerous business first
[00:25:40] of so it's a very tough business when
[00:25:41] it's the most dangerous business the
[00:25:43] most well for for a job yes I mean other
[00:25:45] than going to war and being a
[00:25:47] firefighter or being a cop it's the most
[00:25:50] dangerous business the most dangerous
[00:25:51] being president is the most dangerous
[00:25:53] especially you I mean you haven't even
[00:25:56] got to the election there's been two
[00:25:57] assassinations attempts and they've
[00:26:00] brushed those out of the news like it
[00:26:01] was nothing yeah they'd rather not talk
[00:26:03] about them imagine if there was
[00:26:04] assassination attempts on Biden how hard
[00:26:07] people would be attacking the right how
[00:26:09] they would be trying to get guns taken
[00:26:11] away from people they would try to ramp
[00:26:13] up gun laws they would try to figure out
[00:26:15] some way to blame you if there was a tax
[00:26:17] on if Biden got shot in the ear we would
[00:26:19] have never heard the end of it but I
[00:26:21] think he's in good shape because it's
[00:26:23] only consequential presidents if you
[00:26:25] take a look at what's happened look I'm
[00:26:28] for having countries pay us billions and
[00:26:31] billions and trillions even dollars I
[00:26:33] took in hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:26:35] from China nobody took in 10 cents not
[00:26:37] one other president I do things that
[00:26:39] make it I mean that don't necessarily
[00:26:42] make me so popular I just do what's
[00:26:44] right and when you do that you know
[00:26:46] you're more look at look at Iran Iran we
[00:26:48] would have never had the attack on
[00:26:50] Israel at all Iran was broke I told
[00:26:53] China if you buy you can't do business
[00:26:55] in the United States under any cir I was
[00:26:57] going to we going to go cold turkey with
[00:26:59] China some people think that would have
[00:27:01] been a good idea anyway but if you buy
[00:27:03] any oil one barrel of oil from them
[00:27:05] you're not doing business I said that to
[00:27:07] many countries Iran was broke they had
[00:27:09] no money for Hezbollah they had no money
[00:27:11] for Hamas they had no but I make myself
[00:27:15] you know I mean I understand what I'm
[00:27:17] doing you make yourself a Target and
[00:27:20] it's a very dangerous business but if
[00:27:23] you just look it
[00:27:24] statistically so I I said I saw thing I
[00:27:27] don't know if it's right but 1/10th of
[00:27:29] 1% for a race car driver yeah it's
[00:27:31] pretty dangerous business right yeah uh
[00:27:33] one1 of 1% for a bull rider I I tell you
[00:27:37] to me talk these guys that ride the
[00:27:39] Bulls is worse than UFC is worse these
[00:27:41] guys you see these big monster bulls and
[00:27:44] you see it in slow motion where the the
[00:27:46] foot is like you know an inch away from
[00:27:49] the head if it hits him the guy's gun
[00:27:50] but they die you know they die so one/
[00:27:52] tenth of 1% die what you're saying yeah
[00:27:54] one tenth of 1% die right and they
[00:27:56] certainly get hurt badly really mean
[00:27:58] they can't walk after a certain period
[00:27:59] of time but but with the president if
[00:28:03] you look at the amount of assassination
[00:28:06] and attempts too and attempts no it's a
[00:28:08] very dangerous position I never thought
[00:28:10] of that by the way when I did it I you
[00:28:11] know you don't you don't tend to I did
[00:28:13] you just assume because people loved you
[00:28:15] on The Apprentice they were going to
[00:28:16] love you as a president think it would
[00:28:17] be so easy you know it's probably would
[00:28:19] have been if the media didn't attack you
[00:28:22] the way they did if they didn't conflate
[00:28:24] you with Hitler I mean even today like K
[00:28:27] was talking about you and Hitler you're
[00:28:29] they're going to take what you said
[00:28:30] about Robert E Lee oh Donald Trump
[00:28:32] Wishes the South one that's right he
[00:28:34] loves Robert they love to take things
[00:28:36] out of context and distort things but
[00:28:38] well they they don't even have to take
[00:28:40] them out they make them up entirely okay
[00:28:41] they but you know it's interesting when
[00:28:43] you mentioned the uh the I was very
[00:28:46] popular and and all those people love me
[00:28:49] I mean this uh some of these these women
[00:28:52] they're so they're so stupid and joy she
[00:28:57] would every time she'd see me like I'd
[00:28:59] be in the theater or something and she
[00:29:02] you have to be on the show again come on
[00:29:03] come on let's go we have to she loved
[00:29:04] you she Lov me that episode where people
[00:29:07] should watch that episode just to see
[00:29:09] what we're talking about like I said we
[00:29:10] don't want to get a copyright strike so
[00:29:11] we're not going to put it up but if you
[00:29:13] watch the episode it's bananas it's like
[00:29:15] an alternative universe and it's only
[00:29:18] who n years ago whoopy loved loved you
[00:29:21] gives you a hug and a kiss and how about
[00:29:22] that other one the new one on there the
[00:29:24] uh the one from my Administration she
[00:29:27] writes me a letter the greatest
[00:29:28] president she leaves you know she worked
[00:29:31] as like an assistant press secretary I
[00:29:33] hardly knew her but she leaves and she
[00:29:35] writes me this gorgeous letter what's
[00:29:38] her name she was uh I don't even know
[00:29:40] you know she anyway she was in the
[00:29:42] administration she's on now currently
[00:29:44] sits on the far right hand side whatever
[00:29:46] the hell her name is and and she writes
[00:29:49] a letter the most beautiful letter she's
[00:29:51] quoted in the paper he's a consequential
[00:29:53] he was the greatest president blah blah
[00:29:55] blah then all of a sudden she goes to
[00:29:57] view and she said hitting the hell out
[00:29:58] of me because they won't hire unless
[00:30:00] I've had many people go on CNN and they
[00:30:02] call said I don't know what to do what
[00:30:04] they want to pay me a lot but I have to
[00:30:06] be negative and knew I said be negative
[00:30:08] that's okay there are guys on like CNN
[00:30:11] they won't hire them Shawn Duffy is a
[00:30:14] you know congressman and he retired he
[00:30:16] got a good job with CNN but he was only
[00:30:18] positive about Trump so they kept him
[00:30:21] but they would never put him on I mean I
[00:30:24] respect what he did he could have gone
[00:30:25] you know negative I tell people go
[00:30:28] negative you know let my friends make
[00:30:29] the money well it's so crooked the Press
[00:30:31] is so crooked CR it's crooked but it's
[00:30:33] also they're diminishing themselves
[00:30:36] they're they they are they're killing
[00:30:37] all their credibility and it's opening
[00:30:39] up the credibility to New Media it's
[00:30:41] opening up the credibility to
[00:30:42] Independent Media all these the worst
[00:30:43] I've ever seen though and I've seen the
[00:30:46] worst I mean I've been a part of it I've
[00:30:48] been I've seen the worst kamla goes on
[00:30:50] 60 Minutes gave an answer that a child
[00:30:54] wouldn't give it was so bad in 60
[00:30:57] minutes
[00:30:58] took the answer out they took the whole
[00:31:01] and they put another answer in they
[00:31:03] edited it deceptively which didn't make
[00:31:04] sense either but it was better they took
[00:31:07] the well it wasn't editing it was fraud
[00:31:09] yeah this was not editing you know
[00:31:10] editing is where I'll give an answer and
[00:31:12] they'll take a couple of words and
[00:31:14] change them around or they might even
[00:31:15] take a sentence or two off which is very
[00:31:17] bad but that's it's sort of bad you know
[00:31:19] I'd give an answer which was a very good
[00:31:21] answer I always talk about you know I
[00:31:24] like to give long The Weave you know I
[00:31:26] like to you like to weave things in yeah
[00:31:28] but when you do the weaves and you have
[00:31:29] to be very smart to do weaves when you
[00:31:31] do the weave look at this just in this
[00:31:33] one thing we're talking about little
[00:31:34] pieces here but always ends up no no it
[00:31:37] comes back home for the right people for
[00:31:39] the wrong people it doesn't come back
[00:31:40] home when they end up in the wilderness
[00:31:42] right but but they can take my answer
[00:31:46] and you know what they may take a little
[00:31:47] piece of it out or something and they
[00:31:49] use the term yes we want to save time
[00:31:51] well it's not but I've never heard I
[00:31:54] think it's the biggest scandal in
[00:31:56] broadcast history what happened to C CBS
[00:31:59] so you have CBS 60 minutes that's a news
[00:32:01] program it's not an entertainment
[00:32:03] program it's under their news it's the
[00:32:04] head of their news thing she gives an
[00:32:07] answer that was that shows that she's
[00:32:09] essentially
[00:32:11] incompetent and they took the answer
[00:32:13] could you imagine them doing that for me
[00:32:14] we can show it if you want people to see
[00:32:16] it can we show it no we get in trouble
[00:32:18] we'll get copyright strike okay I'll
[00:32:21] listen anyone can find it but it's it's
[00:32:24] drastic but what was interesting was the
[00:32:27] other full
[00:32:28] version was available initially it was
[00:32:30] like a preview they somebody made a big
[00:32:32] mistake somebody put that preview out
[00:32:33] there put the preview out and then the
[00:32:36] bosses did this or that and then all of
[00:32:37] a sudden they said we got a problem ex
[00:32:39] exactly and then they got caught by
[00:32:41] mistake well you but don't you think
[00:32:43] that's a bit to me and don't forget this
[00:32:45] is election interference and fraud and
[00:32:49] it's 60 minutes it's their news division
[00:32:52] so they it's a big deal they give those
[00:32:54] licenses out Joe for free they should
[00:32:57] pay for Fortune they're worth a fortune
[00:32:59] they give them out for free because
[00:33:01] they're using the public Airwaves with
[00:33:03] cable you don't have that Cable's
[00:33:05] different but you know it it's just a
[00:33:08] different deal but with the networks
[00:33:10] they give those license they're worth
[00:33:12] billions of dollars they give them out
[00:33:14] free but you have to be honest and all
[00:33:16] that was bad I think that David mure and
[00:33:18] that woman that was aside I never even
[00:33:20] heard of her but they kept interrupting
[00:33:22] me it was like I said how many people am
[00:33:24] I debating here I got this one and I got
[00:33:26] you two but he went after me 11
[00:33:29] different times you know it's
[00:33:30] interesting I always thought he was a
[00:33:32] nice guy but he's just like the rest of
[00:33:34] him you know well that's his job
[00:33:36] unfortunately and I'm I'm sure they want
[00:33:39] you're right well the problem was they
[00:33:41] fact checked you and they didn't fact
[00:33:42] check her and one of most egregious
[00:33:44] examples of that was when she said that
[00:33:47] there is there are no troops right now
[00:33:49] deployed in war zones there's a very
[00:33:52] famous viral video that went online of
[00:33:54] troops in a war zone saying well what
[00:33:56] the are we then because there's
[00:33:59] thousands of them Dan khaw the
[00:34:01] congressman uh posted on his Instagram
[00:34:04] all of the various examples of troops
[00:34:08] that are deployed thousands and
[00:34:10] thousands of troops that are currently
[00:34:11] deployed stupidly deployed but the point
[00:34:13] is if this is going to be an actual real
[00:34:15] debate and not a propaganda exercise if
[00:34:17] it's going to be a real debate you have
[00:34:19] to fact check everybody like if someone
[00:34:21] says maybe she thought there was no
[00:34:23] which is also a problem so it's one of
[00:34:25] two things it's either it was not true
[00:34:28] was a lie on purpose which is terrible
[00:34:31] or it was the opposite it was ignorance
[00:34:34] which is also terrible well you when I
[00:34:35] said crime is soaring he said no no
[00:34:38] crime has gone down I said where did you
[00:34:40] hear that one crime has gone down I mean
[00:34:42] I'm debating with this guy but I've had
[00:34:45] that well there was amended FBI
[00:34:47] statistics that came out after that that
[00:34:49] showed the crime had gone up
[00:34:50] substantially and by the way the
[00:34:51] statistics were a fraud because when
[00:34:53] they put out the statistics they didn't
[00:34:55] include some of the worst places they
[00:34:56] didn't include some of the worst cities
[00:34:58] some of the most deadly places but when
[00:35:01] the real numbers came out I turned out
[00:35:03] to be right but I haven't you turn out
[00:35:04] to be right but then there's another
[00:35:05] problem unreported crime is way up
[00:35:08] because people have lost look the morale
[00:35:10] that the police department has in a lot
[00:35:12] of these cities where they've done this
[00:35:13] defund the police these the
[00:35:15] morale these poor cops it's
[00:35:16] horrible it's the dumbest idea of all
[00:35:18] time but what they've done is they've
[00:35:21] they've made these cops feel terrible
[00:35:23] like good cops I think cops are just
[00:35:25] like everybody else most of them are
[00:35:27] great it's like everybody else but if
[00:35:28] you run into one Carpenter and he does a
[00:35:30] shitty job in your house you say
[00:35:32] Carpenters suck but they don't
[00:35:34] suck most of them are great and that's
[00:35:36] the with cops but the point is like they
[00:35:39] they did all of these things in this
[00:35:41] very foolish way and these cops are
[00:35:44] suffering the consequences of it and so
[00:35:46] subsequently what happens is a lot of
[00:35:48] crime is unreported a lot of crime like
[00:35:51] you call the cops they're too busy they
[00:35:52] can't even get you or your house got
[00:35:54] broken into sorry you know it doesn't
[00:35:56] even make a report there's a lot of
[00:35:58] people that they just give up it's so
[00:36:01] sad what's happened and I'll tell you
[00:36:03] what uh I go to police funerals and we
[00:36:07] went to one in Long Island I visited the
[00:36:09] family in Long Island a very big deal
[00:36:12] it's so dangerous people don't realiz
[00:36:14] the car dark Windows pull over he's a
[00:36:19] gentleman please pull over door opens
[00:36:21] guy comes out
[00:36:22] firing even if they were allowed to pull
[00:36:24] out their gun which they're not they
[00:36:26] can't you know pull out time they still
[00:36:28] wouldn't have time it's every cop's
[00:36:29] worst nightmare it they open a door and
[00:36:33] he was killed and his partner was hurt
[00:36:35] he was killed and you don't have I mean
[00:36:38] you don't even have an eighth of a
[00:36:39] second to think and it is such a
[00:36:42] dangerous job that in particular think
[00:36:44] of it you go up to a car you don't know
[00:36:46] who's sitting there with a gun and if
[00:36:47] they have a gun you really don't have a
[00:36:49] chance you're not allowed to have your
[00:36:50] gun out by the way you have they have
[00:36:52] very strict rules so number one there're
[00:36:55] but even if you could have your gun out
[00:36:57] the door opens and a guy and bullets
[00:36:59] start firing out you know and especially
[00:37:01] where they have the dark Windows where
[00:37:03] they have the darkened Windows it is
[00:37:05] such a dangerous POS uh profession and
[00:37:08] it's very hard to get cops now because
[00:37:11] they they're not given any backup and
[00:37:13] you're right you can you know they have
[00:37:15] like an eighth of a second to make a
[00:37:17] decision that's going to change their
[00:37:18] life if they make the wrong decision
[00:37:20] they're going to end up on the front
[00:37:21] page of every newspaper in in the
[00:37:23] country and they're going to lose their
[00:37:25] house and their pension and their their
[00:37:27] job and their wife is going to be gone
[00:37:29] and everything's going to be gone abely
[00:37:30] and there here's another thing that
[00:37:31] people don't talk about how many of them
[00:37:32] have PTSD probably most of them these
[00:37:35] guys are seeing people shot all the time
[00:37:37] you know I I've talked to a ton of cops
[00:37:40] about it and you know a lot of cops
[00:37:41] commit suicide a lot of cops are deeply
[00:37:43] depressed a lot of but we have to give
[00:37:45] them back their dignity we have to we
[00:37:48] can't we just have to give them back you
[00:37:51] said it's so good you you never hear so
[00:37:53] anybody say that you're never going to
[00:37:54] have it perfect you're going to have a
[00:37:56] bad apple in everything every profession
[00:37:58] but every time there's a bad apple that
[00:38:00] gets massive publicity and it it taints
[00:38:02] everybody else but it's also this very
[00:38:04] irresponsible thing where people say
[00:38:06] defund the police get rid of the police
[00:38:07] you know even com Harris was a part of
[00:38:09] that that it's a it's a very stupid way
[00:38:11] to look at it what you should do is fund
[00:38:13] the police you should have better
[00:38:14] training you should have cops that feel
[00:38:16] more appreciated you do you should have
[00:38:18] some something that helps mitigate this
[00:38:20] PTSD that all of them suffer through
[00:38:22] right she was a big part of defund the
[00:38:25] police that was a big thing for her
[00:38:26] defund the police always to fund the
[00:38:28] police well was it's a political idea
[00:38:31] but any anybody with that political
[00:38:33] thought I don't think should be running
[00:38:34] for president and I think people are
[00:38:36] getting wise to it you know we're doing
[00:38:38] pretty well now I don't know maybe in a
[00:38:40] week from now say sorry about that I was
[00:38:42] wrong but we're leading everything and I
[00:38:45] think we're going to have a very good
[00:38:46] election but I tell because people are
[00:38:48] starting to get to know her but she was
[00:38:51] defund the police she was all these
[00:38:53] transgender operations you know if you
[00:38:56] wanted a sex change and you were in
[00:38:57] detention and you demanded a sex change
[00:39:00] they would give you a sex change well
[00:39:02] the wildest one is this idea of giving
[00:39:04] free sex change to illegal immigrants
[00:39:07] that's right in detention that is the
[00:39:10] wildest thing is that the biggest
[00:39:12] problem you have you just walked here
[00:39:14] from Guatemala you need to become a girl
[00:39:16] but she was in favor of it so so think
[00:39:18] of it she was now she changed she
[00:39:20] changed 15 policies in fact I'm going to
[00:39:23] send her a Maga cap she stole your idea
[00:39:25] about no tax for tips
[00:39:27] I I came up with this idea that honestly
[00:39:30] nobody ever heard of and all now it took
[00:39:33] her two months but you know what all of
[00:39:34] a sudden it what caught fire and she
[00:39:36] just put it into a little speech yeah
[00:39:38] well I think we have I think we still
[00:39:40] have that issue I think that issue is a
[00:39:41] good one for us but um no we have a lot
[00:39:44] of good issues you know we had the the
[00:39:45] other day think of how simple some of
[00:39:46] these things are we're trying to get
[00:39:48] cars built in the United States Detroit
[00:39:50] has been really tough It's been a
[00:39:52] disaster they have a huge Factory a huge
[00:39:55] car auto plant being built by China in
[00:39:57] Mexico make cars sell them in the United
[00:39:58] States put everybody out of business
[00:40:00] right here we go again I said if that
[00:40:03] plant is there when I'm president I will
[00:40:05] put 100 or 200% tariffs on every car
[00:40:09] they'll be unsalable in the United
[00:40:11] States and they just announced they're
[00:40:13] not going to build the plant because
[00:40:14] they think I'm going to win think of it
[00:40:15] they're not going to build the plant
[00:40:17] this was the biggest plant in the world
[00:40:19] it would have more than all of Michigan
[00:40:22] makes that's how big you know this is
[00:40:24] what we're getting to and I said if that
[00:40:28] plan goes up I want them to understand
[00:40:30] if I win I'm going to tax those cars at
[00:40:33] the rate of a 100 or 200% of piece so
[00:40:36] that you won't be able to sell them in
[00:40:37] the United States they just announced
[00:40:39] they're not going to build a plan yeah I
[00:40:40] read that I did a big favor for our
[00:40:43] country by doing that and I'm not even
[00:40:45] there yet to me the most beautiful word
[00:40:48] and I've said this for the last couple
[00:40:49] of weeks in the dictionary today and any
[00:40:53] is the word tariff it's more beautiful
[00:40:56] than love it's more beautiful than
[00:40:58] anything it's the most beautiful word
[00:41:01] this country can become rich with the
[00:41:04] use the proper use of tariffs it'll keep
[00:41:07] did you just float out the idea of
[00:41:09] getting rid of income taxes and
[00:41:11] replacing it with tariffs well okay were
[00:41:13] we serious about that our yeah sure why
[00:41:15] not because we ready our country was the
[00:41:19] richest in the relatively in the 1880s
[00:41:22] and
[00:41:23] 1890s a president who was assassinated
[00:41:26] named McKinley he was the Tariff King he
[00:41:29] spoke beautifully of terce his his
[00:41:31] language was really beautiful uh we will
[00:41:34] not allow the enemy to come in and take
[00:41:38] our jobs and take our factories and take
[00:41:40] our workers and take our families unless
[00:41:43] they pay a big price and the big price
[00:41:45] is tariffs and he'd speak like that but
[00:41:49] he was right and then around in the
[00:41:51] early 1900s they switched over stupidly
[00:41:53] to frankly an income tax and you know
[00:41:56] why because countries were putting a lot
[00:41:58] of pressure in America we don't want to
[00:41:59] pay tariffs please don't you you know
[00:42:01] they believe me they control our
[00:42:03] politicians if you look at the kind of
[00:42:05] numbers that these guys make then and
[00:42:09] now but we had a commission meeting in
[00:42:13] the uh 18 I think it was 1887 think of
[00:42:17] this problem we were so rich we had so
[00:42:21] much money we didn't know what to do so
[00:42:23] they set up a blue ribbon Commission on
[00:42:26] tariffs and the sole purpose is what to
[00:42:29] do with all the money we had we were so
[00:42:32] rich because we were taxing other people
[00:42:35] for coming in and taking our jobs and
[00:42:38] China does it that's what China did if
[00:42:40] you want to open a factory and sell cars
[00:42:43] if you build a factory or have a factory
[00:42:45] they don't take our cars they they
[00:42:46] wouldn't take our cars but if you build
[00:42:49] a plant in China you can do that Elon
[00:42:52] did that by the way Elon is great that
[00:42:55] guy is such a great guy I think you're a
[00:42:57] fan of he is from a different planet
[00:43:00] he's the greatest guy that rocket coming
[00:43:03] in I talk I'm I'm I told the story once
[00:43:06] or twice so you may have heard it
[00:43:08] because his speeches have been good did
[00:43:10] you see the one last night yeah 29,000
[00:43:12] people that was a and the one the night
[00:43:14] before was the same thing we are we are
[00:43:17] rocking and rolling but but Elon and I'm
[00:43:20] talking to this very important guy I
[00:43:22] said wait a minute I'm looking at
[00:43:24] something the television's on muted
[00:43:25] right and I see just rocket it's all
[00:43:28] Brown from the heat you know like 10,000
[00:43:32] Dees pouring down at thousands of miles
[00:43:34] an hour and I see this thing you know
[00:43:36] it's like a 20 story building and it
[00:43:38] catches and I say to this guy's an
[00:43:39] important guy wait a minute let me just
[00:43:42] put you to hold it I got to see this and
[00:43:45] I see this and and it's going to crash I
[00:43:47] say it's going to crash into the Gantry
[00:43:49] they call it a Gantry I said oh man
[00:43:51] that's got to be a disaster cuz it's
[00:43:53] starting to get very close and then all
[00:43:54] of a sudden you see the flames in the
[00:43:56] bottom
[00:43:57] and it boom and then you see the two
[00:43:59] arms grab it crazy and I forgot the guy
[00:44:02] I had him on the phone I forgot no I
[00:44:04] said the hell with no I called Elon I
[00:44:06] said was that you he said that was me
[00:44:09] and I said who else can do that he said
[00:44:10] nobody Russia can't do it the United
[00:44:12] States nobody can do it you know I set
[00:44:15] up space force that was me and that's
[00:44:16] the first time in 82 years that we
[00:44:18] opened another Branch since the Air
[00:44:20] Force and that's going to be one of our
[00:44:23] most important things but think of what
[00:44:24] Elon does and he did one other thing
[00:44:27] that I never heard of it it's uh
[00:44:30] starlink I went down to North Carolina
[00:44:33] Georgia the different places right I
[00:44:35] followed it right down and they had no
[00:44:38] communication the polls were all knocked
[00:44:39] down every and one of the guys in North
[00:44:42] Carolina said could you do me a favor do
[00:44:45] you know Elon Musk yes he endorsed me by
[00:44:48] the way he gave me the nicest
[00:44:49] endorsement to this the tougher he said
[00:44:51] the country's going to fail you should
[00:44:53] do the same thing Joe because you cannot
[00:44:55] be voting for Kamala
[00:44:57] Kamala you're not a Kamala person I know
[00:44:59] you I've watched you I know him better
[00:45:01] than he you know what without speaking
[00:45:03] to you I think I know you maybe almost
[00:45:05] as well as your wife I have watched you
[00:45:07] for so many years you're not a Kamala
[00:45:09] person you're a kabib person but you're
[00:45:12] not a Kamala person no nobody's going to
[00:45:14] know who khabib is but oh they know who
[00:45:17] he was he was not he was not bad right
[00:45:19] that guy oh he was phenomenal but that's
[00:45:21] your kind of your weave is getting wide
[00:45:22] we're getting wide with this weave I
[00:45:24] want to bring it back to ter but wait
[00:45:26] one sec before we finished with tariffs
[00:45:27] I just so they said they said could you
[00:45:30] get him we need starlink and I call Elon
[00:45:33] he got it for him so fast saved so many
[00:45:35] lives and I said how was it they said
[00:45:37] better than the wires you know they
[00:45:39] couldn't put them in they were all they
[00:45:41] were all gone so getting I used it
[00:45:43] recently in Utah in the mountains did
[00:45:44] you find it good oh it's phenomenal it's
[00:45:46] the size of a like a iPad you just set
[00:45:48] it down on the ground you get highspeed
[00:45:50] internet it's incredible we're spending
[00:45:52] just to show you we're spending a
[00:45:54] trillion dollars to get tables all over
[00:45:57] the country right up to Upstate areas
[00:46:01] where you have like two farms and
[00:46:02] they're spending millions of dollars to
[00:46:04] have talk about the 42 billion doll that
[00:46:07] was wasted on this Internet access
[00:46:09] program the United they didn't get
[00:46:11] anybody access inter they haven't hooked
[00:46:13] up one person yet not one person they
[00:46:15] spent $42 billion they could have gotten
[00:46:17] starlinks to everybody with that kind of
[00:46:19] money for almost nothing yeah for a
[00:46:21] monthly charge and it would have been
[00:46:23] incredible and it's high speed internet
[00:46:24] everywhere you want to go and he wanted
[00:46:26] to do that and he wanted to do it how
[00:46:27] about this they they built uh the
[00:46:30] charger stations right in the Midwest
[00:46:33] Midwest they built eight of them they
[00:46:36] cost billion dollar that's like a gas
[00:46:38] pump right they built nine gas pumps
[00:46:41] except electricity comes out they spent
[00:46:43] n billion three of them don't work the
[00:46:46] whole thing there's so much waste I
[00:46:49] could I could sit here and tell you
[00:46:50] about things that that there's so much
[00:46:53] waste abuse and fraud oh there's yeah
[00:46:58] I'm I'm sure I mean I think everybody's
[00:47:00] aware of that now let's get back to ter
[00:47:01] when when you're talking about one of
[00:47:02] the criticisms of your Administration
[00:47:04] was with tax cuts and with tariffs you
[00:47:07] increase the
[00:47:08] deficit so was the Strate what was the
[00:47:12] strategy behind that and did you think
[00:47:14] it was going to increase the deficit uh
[00:47:16] by a substantial amount I okay we were
[00:47:18] ready to Ruck it was all you know I had
[00:47:21] a bad system we had horrible tax policy
[00:47:24] I made it great with a much lower tax
[00:47:28] rate so I took it from almost 40% down
[00:47:31] to
[00:47:31] 21% now I'm bringing it from 21 down to
[00:47:34] 15 but only if you make your product in
[00:47:38] the United States which is great people
[00:47:40] call me they said what a great idea
[00:47:41] nobody ever heard of that before I don't
[00:47:43] care if they make the product in Japan
[00:47:45] why should I give them so it's a 21 that
[00:47:48] at 21 in the first year we took in much
[00:47:52] more Revenue than we did at almost 40
[00:47:55] think of that it inspired now we had
[00:47:57] other things too we we were able to get
[00:48:00] people to bring back their money you
[00:48:01] couldn't you couldn't bring back your
[00:48:03] money if you had money in Europe like
[00:48:06] apple apple had many billions of dollars
[00:48:10] outside they couldn't bring it there was
[00:48:11] no way to bring it back in uh the
[00:48:13] bureaucracy the documents the whole
[00:48:15] thing and also the tax was too high you
[00:48:17] know they wanted like half of it or
[00:48:18] something nobody's going to do that so
[00:48:20] they they leave their money in Japan and
[00:48:22] and they spend their money there that
[00:48:25] was part of what I did the money came
[00:48:27] pouring back in apple took in hundreds
[00:48:29] of billions of dollars they brought it
[00:48:30] back from overseas they brought it in so
[00:48:32] how does the deficit increase because of
[00:48:33] that so what happened is this we were
[00:48:36] ready to rock and roll and then we had
[00:48:38] the co thing and we had to focus on that
[00:48:41] and if we didn't give some businesses a
[00:48:44] hand that would have all you would have
[00:48:46] had a depression like in
[00:48:47] 1929 but we were ready to start we were
[00:48:50] going to we would have very shortly been
[00:48:52] paying off debt you know we have $35
[00:48:55] trillion in debt
[00:48:57] and I'll never forget it we were it was
[00:48:59] talking about uh from you know the
[00:49:01] standpoint of being in office I'm in the
[00:49:04] Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin
[00:49:07] and Fabrizio they're two very good
[00:49:09] pollsters probably I don't know I would
[00:49:10] say the two best who knows but very good
[00:49:13] pollsters and we're starting to think
[00:49:15] about running for a second term and we
[00:49:19] had the greatest economy in history
[00:49:22] never has there been an economy like and
[00:49:24] you attribute that to lowering taxes tff
[00:49:26] two things and also I cut regulations
[00:49:28] more than anybody
[00:49:30] else and if I asked many of the
[00:49:32] businessmen you know from the big
[00:49:34] companies you know the guys running the
[00:49:35] big companies I'd say so if you had your
[00:49:37] choice you've had it now for a long time
[00:49:40] what's more important to you the tax
[00:49:42] cuts you paid less tax or the regulation
[00:49:45] Cuts every one of them said the
[00:49:47] regulation Cuts meant more who would
[00:49:49] think that right because you don't
[00:49:51] equate it to dollars but it actually is
[00:49:53] more dollars um we had going and then we
[00:49:57] just had to focus on something else but
[00:50:00] they were sitting there these two these
[00:50:01] two pollsters were sitting there and
[00:50:04] they said sir if George Washington came
[00:50:07] back and Abraham Lincoln was his VP as
[00:50:11] opposed to waltz how bad is he by the
[00:50:14] way but if Abraham Lincoln was his VP
[00:50:18] they couldn't beat you you have and I'll
[00:50:21] never forget it the following day they
[00:50:24] said something's happening in China sir
[00:50:27] could we meet I said what's happening
[00:50:30] people are dying and it was all around
[00:50:32] the Wuhan lab by the way there are
[00:50:35] pictures with little lines their body
[00:50:38] bags all around the Wuhan lab and I
[00:50:42] always said that from the beginning Joe
[00:50:43] was you know they tried to say first
[00:50:44] they said it was France and you know
[00:50:46] they blamed everybody but then they say
[00:50:48] it was bats from a cave 2,000 miles away
[00:50:51] so we got hit with that and despite that
[00:50:55] we had the best economy and when I gave
[00:50:58] it over the stock market was higher than
[00:51:01] it was preo I mean nobody could even
[00:51:03] believe it but we saved it and we were
[00:51:07] helping businesses they were dying you
[00:51:10] know they were D so it's your belief
[00:51:11] that if you had a second term given the
[00:51:14] policies in place the way the economy
[00:51:16] was booming that you would have been
[00:51:18] able to pay off a lot of the debt and
[00:51:20] that we didn't have Co we would have
[00:51:22] been paying off debt and we would have
[00:51:24] had and don't forget by growth the word
[00:51:28] growth is actually more important in a
[00:51:29] way because you could have the same debt
[00:51:30] but if you double your growth all of a
[00:51:32] sudden you're under levered but still we
[00:51:35] should pay off debt you know if you view
[00:51:37] this um $35 trillion right now it's a
[00:51:41] lot but if you look at the asset value
[00:51:44] if you looked at it purely as an asset
[00:51:45] value we have oil underground we have
[00:51:49] water we have mountains we have the I
[00:51:51] mean the assets are so enormous but
[00:51:54] regardless of that we've got 35 trillion
[00:51:57] in debt we should pay it off and we
[00:51:59] would have started paying off debt and
[00:52:01] probably even giving further given
[00:52:04] further tax reductions I want to get it
[00:52:07] down to 15% we're going to do more
[00:52:09] business but when you get hit with a CO
[00:52:12] everything stops and you have to keep
[00:52:13] these businesses alive the businesses
[00:52:15] were dying I mean they were just dying
[00:52:17] this whole place this country was going
[00:52:18] to die are there influences um outside
[00:52:22] of environmental that keep people from
[00:52:24] wanting to drill for oil and Frack and
[00:52:27] and do those sort of things outside of
[00:52:29] the environmental concerns which are
[00:52:30] legitimate of course no I but are there
[00:52:33] other influences that maybe over
[00:52:36] accentuate or OV exaggerate these
[00:52:39] environmental effects are are people
[00:52:40] being influenced in a way where they're
[00:52:42] trying to keep us from producing
[00:52:45] American Oil yeah yeah so the
[00:52:48] environmental is the biggest tool for
[00:52:50] stopping growth the biggest tool the
[00:52:52] other is
[00:52:54] regulation and if you speak to Elon he
[00:52:56] to the regulation now to send a rocket
[00:52:58] up to anywhere even if you do everything
[00:53:00] it's it's almost it's becoming
[00:53:04] impossible but they use environmental in
[00:53:07] order to get people not to do anything
[00:53:12] and sometimes I say you know I look at
[00:53:15] some of the I know the environmental
[00:53:16] stuff better because I had to build
[00:53:18] buildings in New York I had to build I
[00:53:19] had to do environmental impact studies
[00:53:21] and I would see some of these guys that
[00:53:23] i' hire for a lot of money
[00:53:24] environmentalists that would get you
[00:53:26] through the process and they' be up in
[00:53:28] Albany that's the capital of New York
[00:53:30] and they're up they're trying to make it
[00:53:32] tougher for guys like me that were
[00:53:34] Builders because they'd get ba paid more
[00:53:37] money in other words I I had one guy uh
[00:53:41] highly recommended all you know I was
[00:53:43] good at getting permits I was one of the
[00:53:45] kings of I was always very good but the
[00:53:48] environmental stuff was always horrible
[00:53:51] they could slow a project down 10 years
[00:53:53] 15 years I had a project in Louisiana
[00:53:55] built big LG plant it was uh for 14
[00:54:00] years it was going to cost1 18 million
[00:54:02] $18 billion one of the biggest like the
[00:54:05] Empire State Building laying down on the
[00:54:06] side times four massive in the coast on
[00:54:10] the Gulf
[00:54:11] Coast and they said sir are they're
[00:54:12] going to give it up I said that they
[00:54:14] shouldn't give it up what's the problem
[00:54:15] they can't get their environmental they
[00:54:17] had environmental permits that would
[00:54:19] fill this whole room up to the ceiling
[00:54:22] and they said there was one mistake on
[00:54:23] one little line they wanted to do it all
[00:54:25] over again it's not going to happen and
[00:54:28] I got them their permit instantly and
[00:54:32] they built the plant it's massive so
[00:54:34] when you're saying that so there's
[00:54:37] there's people that are making money by
[00:54:38] making it difficult are you talking
[00:54:40] about lawyers because they're dring
[00:54:42] about environmental consultants and
[00:54:44] lawyers environmental Consultants profit
[00:54:46] off of dragging out the process
[00:54:48] absolutely and process worse how do they
[00:54:51] i' probably do the same thing about with
[00:54:52] them to be honest with you you I want to
[00:54:54] be honest with you how do they do that
[00:54:56] how do they make it they go let's say
[00:54:58] New York they go to Albany okay and they
[00:55:00] convince people that if you have a
[00:55:02] certain type of plant on the ground
[00:55:03] that's this big and in theory valous
[00:55:06] that it's a rare plant and you cannot
[00:55:09] ever even touch it you can't go near it
[00:55:12] you can't put a building on it you can't
[00:55:14] do anything or there's a little puddle
[00:55:18] and they call it a lake and you have to
[00:55:20] go by the standards of a lake I said no
[00:55:22] no that's a puddle oh you have no idea
[00:55:25] guys are filling a little puddle
[00:55:26] you have no idea what they do and they
[00:55:29] use it as a way to stop you they use it
[00:55:31] as a way to stop you and also as the way
[00:55:33] to generate money I'm I'm curious how
[00:55:35] how are they generating money that way
[00:55:37] though well they get fees they get fees
[00:55:39] massive fees and you pay these guys
[00:55:41] people rely on them as experts because
[00:55:44] they're the people that they go to when
[00:55:45] they have to run these studies in the
[00:55:47] first place but some of them are just
[00:55:48] bad guys and they're trying to make it
[00:55:50] more and more difficult and they have a
[00:55:51] lot of power uh yeah I I think they
[00:55:54] maybe had more they didn't have as much
[00:55:55] with me because because I would get
[00:55:57] through them and I understood it look
[00:55:59] I've had I've done so many envir they
[00:56:01] call it environmental impact study I did
[00:56:04] so much to build a building to build a
[00:56:06] building in New York is very tough you
[00:56:07] got to be very you got to deal with
[00:56:09] think of it financing
[00:56:12] unions uh all the municipal stuff
[00:56:16] environmental of all of it to me the
[00:56:18] toughest thing was the environmental
[00:56:20] because they could stop you cold with
[00:56:23] the environmental impact study stuff and
[00:56:25] and you deal you hire a so-called expert
[00:56:28] they say sir he's the one guy he can get
[00:56:30] you through the morass it's a morass
[00:56:32] it's horrible they use it as a weapon
[00:56:34] they use it all over the country right
[00:56:35] but there are legitimate concerns about
[00:56:37] environmental impact correct like look
[00:56:39] about the BP oil spill there's a lot of
[00:56:41] things that do happen that are
[00:56:42] environmentally devastating and you want
[00:56:44] to mitigate that as much as possible you
[00:56:47] do look I I had during our four years we
[00:56:49] had the cleanest air in the cleanest
[00:56:51] water I view it differently I say air
[00:56:54] and water remember this it costs much
[00:56:57] more to do things environmentally clean
[00:57:01] China doesn't do anything right when
[00:57:03] Carrie goes to see uh president Chia
[00:57:06] China which he probably doesn't even get
[00:57:08] to see him but they look at him oh yes
[00:57:11] yes we will do oh yes yes we're going to
[00:57:13] do that no more coal no more coal just
[00:57:15] and then they approve 58 coal plants for
[00:57:17] the next you know every they build a
[00:57:19] coal plant a week okay they build a lot
[00:57:21] of coal plants we but let me just say
[00:57:22] though so here we are cleaning and
[00:57:24] scrubbing everything and everything
[00:57:26] the's got to be pure but in 3.8
[00:57:30] days that stuff floating over China is
[00:57:33] right over the top of us right same
[00:57:35] thing with the oceans they dump their
[00:57:38] garbage into the Pacific Ocean if you
[00:57:41] take a little Cork and put it there in
[00:57:44] about a week and a half it'll be in
[00:57:46] front of Los
[00:57:47] Angeles we're picking up their garbage
[00:57:50] so nobody ever talks about that but in a
[00:57:53] way the bigger one is even the air it's
[00:57:56] occurrence it's an amazing thing it's
[00:57:58] been flowing that way for a million
[00:58:00] years so long before we share with the
[00:58:03] whole world yeah no if we're the Sahara
[00:58:06] dust clouds over here absolutely we get
[00:58:08] dust clouds in Austin from the Sahara
[00:58:10] desert but we get the China you know
[00:58:13] they call it the China curse we get the
[00:58:15] China curse they're better and their air
[00:58:18] is dirty you know when I went there uh I
[00:58:20] had a great relationship with President
[00:58:22] she we got along very well and they
[00:58:25] treated me better than anybody has ever
[00:58:27] been treated same thing with Saudi
[00:58:28] Arabia number of them but they laid it
[00:58:31] out and I said this air is good do you
[00:58:34] know they closed every Factory one week
[00:58:37] before I got there from within 200 miles
[00:58:40] that's like what Gavin Nome did when XI
[00:58:42] Jing ping came to San Francisco he
[00:58:44] cleaned it up he got rid of all the
[00:58:46] terrible in away to think you know he
[00:58:48] cleaned it up and then it became a pigi
[00:58:51] well the dumbest thing is he said when
[00:58:52] your friends come by when you have
[00:58:54] visitors you clean up your house
[00:58:56] like how about just keep your
[00:58:57] house clean can you imagine that's the
[00:58:59] dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody
[00:59:00] say ever as a governor as to excuse to
[00:59:03] why you finally cleaned up your homeless
[00:59:05] problem and the day he left right back
[00:59:07] to it went right back yeah but in a way
[00:59:10] that was a bad thing that he did because
[00:59:12] he
[00:59:13] showed what a disgrace that was what a
[00:59:16] disgrace well this is the thing that
[00:59:18] like shows you how foolish a lot of
[00:59:20] these people that are running these
[00:59:21] cities think a lot of these people that
[00:59:23] are running these states think it's it's
[00:59:24] foolish like you you're insulting the
[00:59:27] intelligence of the people that live in
[00:59:29] that City that are impacted by these
[00:59:31] people just camping and needles and
[00:59:34] human feces there's a an app that you
[00:59:37] can buy there's an app that you can get
[00:59:39] rather that will show you where the
[00:59:40] human feces has been documented in San
[00:59:43] Francisco it's a poo app and it's just
[00:59:46] everywhere it's just bum crap everywhere
[00:59:48] but let let me give you one that you may
[00:59:50] not know okay which I think you know
[00:59:52] everything actually as a student as a
[00:59:55] student of yours
[00:59:56] but but water you know in Los Angeles
[01:00:01] you can't get proper amounts of water
[01:00:03] right and it's unbelievably expensive
[01:00:05] and you might have a house in Beverly
[01:00:06] Hills and they're actually thinking
[01:00:08] about rationing water can you believe it
[01:00:11] I can believe it I was in I was in the
[01:00:13] farm Court country with some of the
[01:00:15] congressmen were driving up a highway
[01:00:17] and I say how come all this land is
[01:00:20] so Barren it's farmland and it looked
[01:00:24] terrible it was just Brown and bad I
[01:00:27] said but there's always that little
[01:00:28] corner that's so green and beautiful
[01:00:32] they said we have no water I said do you
[01:00:35] have a drought no we don't have a
[01:00:36] drought I said why don't you have no
[01:00:38] water because the water isn't allowed to
[01:00:40] flow down it's got a natural flow from
[01:00:42] Canada all the way up North water more
[01:00:44] water than they could ever use and in
[01:00:47] order to protect a tiny little fish uh
[01:00:50] the Water up north gets routed into the
[01:00:54] Pacific Ocean millions of millions of
[01:00:56] gallons of water gets poured you get to
[01:00:59] see this we're driving up and I had
[01:01:01] never seen it before it's the most it's
[01:01:03] like Iowa it's the most fertile land
[01:01:05] Iowa was blessed with great land Idaho
[01:01:08] for a potato right but these they
[01:01:10] they're just by the way you know some
[01:01:12] land is good for a potato some land is
[01:01:14] good for corn it's the craziest thing I
[01:01:15] love the farmers that great they're the
[01:01:17] greatest and by the way they're getting
[01:01:19] killed right now they they're getting
[01:01:20] killed because of this stupid
[01:01:21] Administration but so I see this and I
[01:01:24] said you got to be kidding
[01:01:26] I said you mean you have water and I
[01:01:28] looked at it it's like a valve in your
[01:01:31] sink except it's massive the thing's
[01:01:33] five times taller than your ceiling did
[01:01:35] you know the center of California was a
[01:01:36] giant
[01:01:37] Lake they have so much water you ever
[01:01:39] see what it looks like before they
[01:01:40] rerouted saw that the center of
[01:01:42] California like what is it 200 years ago
[01:01:45] how long ago did they do that Jamie the
[01:01:47] the center of California had a
[01:01:49] enormous Lake in the middle of
[01:01:51] California so they dumped it into the
[01:01:52] Pacific who knows what they did but what
[01:01:55] whatever foolishness that they did led
[01:01:58] to the situation that they're in now
[01:01:59] think of those dry forests that burn
[01:02:02] down all over the you know the head of
[01:02:04] Austria said t lake or Tachi Lake uh
[01:02:08] it's a freshwater lake in the Southern
[01:02:10] sanen Valley United States historically
[01:02:13] uh T Lake was one of the largest
[01:02:14] freshwater lakes West of Mississippi
[01:02:16] show a photo of what it looked like back
[01:02:19] then it's a great system so that's what
[01:02:21] it looked like look at that image now
[01:02:23] the one go to the one on the third from
[01:02:24] the right yeah yeah that was an enormous
[01:02:27] Lake in the middle of California imagine
[01:02:29] that that' be much more valuable
[01:02:30] property how crazy is that but how crazy
[01:02:32] is that's what it used to look like and
[01:02:33] human beings screwed that up no they let
[01:02:35] it go into the Pacific and then they I
[01:02:37] don't know what they did what did they
[01:02:39] do that why did how did it go missing
[01:02:41] said they drained 83 yeah they drained
[01:02:44] it
[01:02:45] 19 1983 oh my God it went dry a hand
[01:02:49] full of times oh went dry a handful of
[01:02:52] times well you know Lakes do go dry but
[01:02:54] that's a big one but think of it big one
[01:02:56] to go you could have all of the water
[01:02:58] you need all of that land would have
[01:03:01] more water the whole thing could be like
[01:03:03] that little patch lit literally I'd say
[01:03:05] I was with Devon nun as a congressman
[01:03:07] and other Congressman we were going up I
[01:03:09] was visiting that because they asked me
[01:03:11] to go up and visit their territory and I
[01:03:13] did but I kept saying look at this land
[01:03:15] it's beautiful but it's so dry and I
[01:03:18] thought they were going through like a
[01:03:19] desert like a drought they said no we
[01:03:20] have water but it gets so I looked into
[01:03:23] it what is the fish and I got it done I
[01:03:25] got got it done I could have water for
[01:03:28] all of that land water for your Forest
[01:03:30] you know your forests are dry as a bone
[01:03:33] okay dangerous that water could be
[01:03:34] routed you know you could have
[01:03:36] everything oh not only dangerous
[01:03:38] billions of dollars a year they spend on
[01:03:41] forest fires and you know there's a case
[01:03:42] with the environment they're not allowed
[01:03:44] to rake their Forest because you're not
[01:03:47] allowed to touch it when a tree foils
[01:03:49] down after 18 months it becomes very dry
[01:03:51] it's like you know like real firewood
[01:03:53] it's bad you know a tree that's these
[01:03:56] are all things I learned the hard way
[01:03:59] the easy way but when a tree is up it
[01:04:01] sucks water it's wet I went to that the
[01:04:04] hor they had a couple of horrible forest
[01:04:06] fires in California and I went I said
[01:04:08] you know you got a lot of trees standing
[01:04:09] yday were healthy trees sir I said with
[01:04:11] this intense heat they you could see
[01:04:14] they were charred a little bit on the
[01:04:15] bottom but they were going to be all
[01:04:16] right because they're soaking wet
[01:04:18] because they suck up the water right but
[01:04:20] when they fall right they're like you
[01:04:22] know it's like lighting a match yeah and
[01:04:24] you got to be able to clean they call
[01:04:26] maintain your Forest so I was with the
[01:04:27] head of Austria he said you know it's a
[01:04:30] shame I see all those forest fires in
[01:04:32] California and all they have to do is
[01:04:34] clean their Forest meaning rake it up
[01:04:37] get rid of the leaves get rid of you
[01:04:39] know leaves that are sitting there for
[01:04:40] five years and then we certainly get rid
[01:04:42] of the Dead Fall and get rid of the
[01:04:44] trees that have fallen that you know are
[01:04:46] like uh so many things this country by
[01:04:50] the way could you really R the whole
[01:04:52] Forest though I don't think you could
[01:04:53] rake the whole Forest I think you get
[01:04:54] rid of the deadall but raking all the Le
[01:04:56] you could certainly get rid of the Dead
[01:04:58] okay they the real you know
[01:05:00] environmentally they don't want to do
[01:05:01] that they don't they said you know it's
[01:05:02] got to be nature and all the stuff but
[01:05:04] in the meantime this is exactly but you
[01:05:07] could have so it was the Department of
[01:05:10] Commerce that needed the approvals but
[01:05:12] Gavin news had a sign them I got it all
[01:05:15] done nobody could believe it it was all
[01:05:17] done I said I got it you got so much
[01:05:21] water all you have to do is sign and
[01:05:25] that guy didn't want to sign did he not
[01:05:27] want to sign because that would be a
[01:05:29] political victory for you I think no he
[01:05:30] didn't no I don't think so he you know
[01:05:33] he used to say he's a great president
[01:05:35] and we got along we did we actually got
[01:05:37] along at that point but I think somebody
[01:05:39] said uh you just can't continue to call
[01:05:42] him a great president you know they they
[01:05:44] do say that but we had it all done he
[01:05:47] didn't sign and then we got on to other
[01:05:49] things and I I every time I go to
[01:05:51] California said you have so much water
[01:05:54] they don't know it I'm telling you
[01:05:56] people living in Beverly Hills they turn
[01:05:58] off the water same thing with the
[01:05:59] electric they want to go to all electric
[01:06:01] cars but they have brownouts every
[01:06:03] weekend you know well right after they
[01:06:04] made the announcement that as of 2035
[01:06:07] you're not going to be able to buy an
[01:06:08] internal combustion engine in California
[01:06:10] like within a month they had some
[01:06:13] announcement asking people to not charge
[01:06:14] their
[01:06:16] Teslas cuz the grid couldn't handle it
[01:06:19] well how are you I will terminate the
[01:06:20] Mandate immediately just a mandate that
[01:06:23] will be done I would say in my first day
[01:06:25] maybe days because you know it's let me
[01:06:26] ask you about nuclear um one one of the
[01:06:29] things that when I've talked to people
[01:06:31] that uh have a real understanding of
[01:06:32] nuclear power they what their position
[01:06:35] is it's probably the cleanest safest
[01:06:37] form of electricity that we could
[01:06:39] generate and that the fears of nuclear
[01:06:43] power are really about a few disasters
[01:06:46] the Fukushima through Mile Island um
[01:06:49] that that these These are old systems
[01:06:52] and that they could they're much more
[01:06:54] capable now and they're cap making even
[01:06:56] better systems but it's a difficult
[01:06:58] political issue because you think
[01:07:01] nuclear power you think Chernobyl that's
[01:07:03] what everybody does they have this
[01:07:04] connection they had the
[01:07:06] potential or Fukushima where you're not
[01:07:08] supposed to enter the land for 3,000
[01:07:09] years or something it's I think it's
[01:07:11] worse than that I think that area is
[01:07:13] like going to be radioactive for
[01:07:15] probably longer than you could imagine
[01:07:17] but the the point is they're better at
[01:07:19] it now right and that they could do it
[01:07:21] now and you can generate power in a way
[01:07:24] that you don't have to worry about these
[01:07:25] one of the most ridiculous things is
[01:07:27] electric cars being powered by Coal
[01:07:30] Fired plants it's a ridiculous thing
[01:07:32] that's what's happening yeah that is
[01:07:33] what's happening and people want to
[01:07:35] think they're being green you know but
[01:07:37] it's well if that you look at the way
[01:07:38] the battery is made but here's the other
[01:07:40] thing we don't have well we do actually
[01:07:43] it's being held you know we have certain
[01:07:44] areas where we have great raw Earth
[01:07:46] material and we're not allowed to use it
[01:07:48] because of the environment and we have
[01:07:50] areas in California that have incredible
[01:07:52] raw Earth and they're not allowing and
[01:07:55] I'm going to open it up I'm going to let
[01:07:57] them use it but how do you do that how
[01:07:59] do you do that and protect the
[01:08:00] environment because the environment is
[01:08:02] going to be protected you can do it you
[01:08:03] can make a lake out of it okay we'll put
[01:08:05] back a lake I mean something nice about
[01:08:07] Lakes you can do things
[01:08:09] magnificently you just have to do it
[01:08:11] carefully respons absolutely you have to
[01:08:13] do it carefully but the problem you know
[01:08:16] China has all of those areas most of
[01:08:19] those areas and yet when they say go
[01:08:22] electric with the cars China is going to
[01:08:24] be the one that gives us the cars all of
[01:08:26] those guys in Detroit are going to be
[01:08:28] out of business you're going to make
[01:08:29] your electric cars over there we have a
[01:08:30] thing called gasoline and we have more
[01:08:33] oil and gas under our feet than any
[01:08:35] other Nation you know I had uh in Alaska
[01:08:39] there's a find it's called anoir I got
[01:08:41] it approved Reagan couldn't get it
[01:08:43] nobody could get it I got it all done it
[01:08:45] was amazing they were getting ready to
[01:08:48] start drilling the equivalent they think
[01:08:51] of Saudi Arabia one of the biggest vines
[01:08:53] in the world it was all set to go and
[01:08:55] Biden comes in his one of his first
[01:08:57] orders were we're not going to use it it
[01:09:00] would have been so good for the we could
[01:09:02] have supplied all of Asia with oil and
[01:09:05] gas what was the what was the negative
[01:09:06] and you talk about money right uh the
[01:09:08] negative was politically they didn't
[01:09:10] think it was good for them that's all
[01:09:11] that's all it was so you don't think
[01:09:12] that it's environmentally dangerous
[01:09:14] taking it from way down deep in the
[01:09:16] earth environmentally would have been
[01:09:18] fine so it can be done responsibly
[01:09:20] absolutely otherwi prot the environment
[01:09:22] well I think windmills okay so they talk
[01:09:24] about wind I think windmills are really
[01:09:27] disruptive when you talk about the
[01:09:28] environment they kill the birds you want
[01:09:31] to see a bird Cemetery go under a
[01:09:33] windmill someday that hasn't been
[01:09:35] cleaned out with all the bird carcasses
[01:09:38] you it's like massive amounts of bir
[01:09:41] there a massive iore I I went to a ranch
[01:09:44] in South Texas we had to drive past this
[01:09:46] enormous windmill farm and it's gross
[01:09:49] it's dystopian you're you're looking in
[01:09:51] the left and the right all he seees
[01:09:52] these big spinning machines that aren't
[01:09:54] even that effective at generating
[01:09:56] electricity corre most expensive form of
[01:09:58] electricity is a windmill and then they
[01:10:01] start to rust and rot and you have to
[01:10:03] then they get abandoned by the people
[01:10:05] that built them because well you have to
[01:10:06] get rid of all that material too when
[01:10:08] you replace those blades now you have a
[01:10:10] problem because you have dispose right
[01:10:12] you have to dispose these enormous
[01:10:14] windmills and how they say you can't
[01:10:17] bury them so I even question that but
[01:10:19] I'm not going to get into it but they
[01:10:20] say you can't bury the blades so you
[01:10:22] have the blades and you can't bury the
[01:10:24] blades you can bury the blades it's not
[01:10:25] going to matter he can bury you'll find
[01:10:27] areas you can bury but they come up this
[01:10:29] is what I mean they come up with this
[01:10:30] but the environmentalist dream is
[01:10:32] windmills everyone you know what happens
[01:10:35] to them after 5 years they start to rot
[01:10:37] after 10 years you have to replace them
[01:10:39] did you ever look at certain parts of
[01:10:41] California where they have heavy
[01:10:42] windmills and they've been abandoned and
[01:10:44] they're all different manufacturers and
[01:10:46] all different companies and they all
[01:10:48] Haven seen that it is the ugliest thing
[01:10:50] it looks like a graveyard almost a
[01:10:52] graveyard of windmills uh it's pollution
[01:10:55] bad it's it is it's it's no different
[01:10:58] than leaving garbage on the ground how
[01:11:00] about in New Jersey off the coast of New
[01:11:01] Jersey they want to build the people are
[01:11:04] going crazy not to build them but we you
[01:11:07] have them the whales are washing up on
[01:11:08] shore right so in 50 years they had one
[01:11:12] whale come ashore now they had like 18
[01:11:14] come in the last year what is the what
[01:11:17] what is happening with the whales I've
[01:11:18] read about this well they say that the
[01:11:19] wind drives them crazy you know it's a
[01:11:21] vibration because you have those you
[01:11:23] know those things are 50 story building
[01:11:25] some of them right and they're super
[01:11:26] sensitive to vibrations they you know
[01:11:29] the wind is rushing the things are
[01:11:31] blowing it's a vibration and it makes
[01:11:33] noise you know what it is I want to be a
[01:11:35] whale psychiatrist it drives the whales
[01:11:39] freaking crazy and something happens
[01:11:41] with them but for whatever reason
[01:11:43] they're getting washed up unsure and you
[01:11:46] know and yet the environment ignored by
[01:11:48] the envir environmentalist they don't
[01:11:50] talk about it I think there's nothing
[01:11:52] uglier I see it in Scotland I see it all
[01:11:54] over the world you have this beautiful
[01:11:56] Valley it's been there for you know in
[01:11:59] Civilization thousands of years but
[01:12:01] millions of years and all of a sudden
[01:12:03] you have these ugly windmills up would
[01:12:05] your plan to be replace that with
[01:12:07] nuclear what Would You Do Well nuclear
[01:12:09] is better I mean I I think there's a
[01:12:10] little danger to nuclear but you know we
[01:12:11] had some really bad nuclear they did one
[01:12:14] in Alabama they did one in uh I think
[01:12:17] South
[01:12:18] Carolina they do them wrong they build
[01:12:20] these massive things then the
[01:12:22] environmentalists get in it I don't want
[01:12:25] to go into a long story because it's too
[01:12:27] long for the show this show is too
[01:12:28] valuable to talk about concrete but they
[01:12:31] have hardened concrete it's number 12
[01:12:32] concrete it's the hardest it's harder
[01:12:34] than steel it's incredible they put up a
[01:12:36] wall and an inspector comes along those
[01:12:38] nope nope you're a quarter of an inch
[01:12:40] the wall might be 8 feet wide you're a
[01:12:43] quarter of an inch too short I'm sorry
[01:12:45] you got to rip down the wall you got to
[01:12:46] because it's got to be poured
[01:12:47] contiguously right you're one4 of an
[01:12:51] inch I'm sorry I ripped down you can't
[01:12:52] rip it down this stuff you can't put a
[01:12:54] hammer through you can't it's it's
[01:12:56] incredible concrete technology is
[01:12:58] unbelievable what you know what's
[01:13:00] happened you think of concrete you think
[01:13:02] that's an example of overregulation
[01:13:04] pointless well you have an inspector
[01:13:05] that comes along and he says take down
[01:13:07] a$ 25 zillion dollar W these things
[01:13:10] ended up costing $25
[01:13:12] billion and they one of them never got
[01:13:14] opened but here's the story so France
[01:13:18] does it France is largely nuclear and
[01:13:21] they build small little compact plants
[01:13:24] and if they need need more they build
[01:13:25] the same thing and they hook it up and
[01:13:27] they hook it up because they get too big
[01:13:30] and too complex and too expensive and it
[01:13:33] is very clean they say it's it's Absolut
[01:13:37] you know my uncle I had a great uncle
[01:13:38] who was a great genius just like other
[01:13:42] members of my family but he was a
[01:13:45] professor at MIT for I think 41 years he
[01:13:49] was a longest show when I was in the
[01:13:51] White House the head of MIT Princeton
[01:13:53] and Harvard came down to me me and the
[01:13:56] MIT person said I have a book on your
[01:13:58] uncle Dr John Trump he was a longer
[01:14:01] serving Professor he was a great genius
[01:14:03] sir do you know how and he had uh he
[01:14:06] knew everything about nuclear from math
[01:14:08] to chemistry to nuclear he knew it and
[01:14:12] he said someday it's going to be the way
[01:14:13] to go but the problem is so dangerous in
[01:14:16] terms of War he
[01:14:18] said Donald some this was a long time
[01:14:22] Uncle John Dr John Trump he said someday
[01:14:26] you'll have a little Satchel at your
[01:14:28] side and you go into a building and
[01:14:30] you'll be able to blow up New York City
[01:14:32] I said Uncle John that'll never happen
[01:14:34] he's right you know he's right well that
[01:14:36] was part of problem giving nuclear power
[01:14:39] to other countries right like that was
[01:14:41] the problem that happened with India and
[01:14:43] Pakistan they got nuclear power and then
[01:14:46] they were able to weaponize it the
[01:14:47] biggest problem in the world today is
[01:14:49] not global warming it's nuclear warming
[01:14:53] and we have idiots that are negotiating
[01:14:55] for us we have a guy that doesn't make
[01:14:58] it past 4:00 and it's not because of age
[01:15:00] you know they ought to I know so many
[01:15:02] guys in their late 80s and they're
[01:15:04] better than the I said to one guy the
[01:15:05] other day I think you're smarter than
[01:15:06] you were 25 years ago I've known him a
[01:15:08] long time he's 89 years old he's sharp
[01:15:11] as I mean he's
[01:15:12] great Biden gives people a bad name
[01:15:15] because that's not an old that's not an
[01:15:18] age I think they say it because I'm
[01:15:19] three or four years younger you know I
[01:15:21] think that's why they say it they say
[01:15:22] his age it's not his age he he's got a
[01:15:24] problem major brain surgeries he did he
[01:15:27] did those are not good operations and do
[01:15:30] you see what he did today he went runed
[01:15:32] towards the camera and made some apology
[01:15:34] to na Native Americans and uh that he
[01:15:37] said that's why he's headed out west
[01:15:39] like he's off the reservation so to
[01:15:41] speak for lack of a better term you know
[01:15:44] it's interesting because during the
[01:15:46] debate I was uh looking over I'm saying
[01:15:49] this is strange just sort of like
[01:15:51] strange things were happening yeah but
[01:15:54] he couldn't keep it together but do you
[01:15:55] think they knew he couldn't keep it
[01:15:56] together do you think that they wanted
[01:15:58] is that why like historically that
[01:16:00] debate was earlier than they've been in
[01:16:02] the past right I think they wanted to
[01:16:05] get well there's a lot of theories a lot
[01:16:06] of people said do the debate now and
[01:16:08] we'll get them out right I think that
[01:16:11] maybe could be well that is what
[01:16:12] happened it's they also said do the
[01:16:15] debate now and get it over with right uh
[01:16:18] I don't think anybody thought he was
[01:16:19] going to get out really I don't didn't
[01:16:21] make any sense the debate the debate got
[01:16:23] him out but but I think it's very unfair
[01:16:25] look you have a bad debate his numbers
[01:16:28] went down but I think she's not doing
[01:16:30] very well right now and I think she
[01:16:32] looks why want I get to that too because
[01:16:35] it's hard to know like the whole poll
[01:16:37] thing is very bizarre for most people
[01:16:39] because most people don't answer polls
[01:16:40] so they read the polls they're like
[01:16:43] never I did hang up I was never called
[01:16:45] by a PO if I did I wouldn't answer I'm
[01:16:46] busy you know how polls are done oh I'm
[01:16:49] going to get myself in trouble but so I
[01:16:51] really don't believe too much in him so
[01:16:54] well 2016 taught a lot of people about
[01:16:56] the ineffective well they were very
[01:16:57] ineffective because I thought I was
[01:16:59] doing well I'd go to a place and I'd
[01:17:01] have 30 40,000 people Hillary would go
[01:17:03] they have 500 people and they tell me
[01:17:05] I'm going to lose I said why am I going
[01:17:07] to lose I had 40,000 people so she had
[01:17:09] 200 people but you know I have a theory
[01:17:11] these pollsters they charge you a lot of
[01:17:13] money too you know they charge you a
[01:17:14] half a million bucks to do some stupid
[01:17:16] poll and they interview like 251 people
[01:17:19] I don't think they interview him in many
[01:17:21] cases I don't want to get myself in too
[01:17:22] much trouble think no I think
[01:17:24] they sit there they make a deal they get
[01:17:26] a half a million bucks and they say
[01:17:28] Trump's leading 51 to 49 they announce
[01:17:31] it and everybody says oh do you
[01:17:33] understand I I don't think they I think
[01:17:36] in a lot look I'm a very common sense
[01:17:39] person I think that they probably don't
[01:17:42] always Paul some of them probably never
[01:17:45] pa uh what's the difference between 49
[01:17:49] to 51 and 47 and a half well it's also a
[01:17:52] tiny percentage of the population I
[01:17:55] don't think it's representative of the
[01:17:56] overall population I just don't think I
[01:17:58] don't know of one person in my whole
[01:18:00] life that ever got called by a puler
[01:18:02] exactly that's my point so here's here's
[01:18:06] my question but I shouldn't say that
[01:18:07] because I'm doing very you know really
[01:18:09] well in the polls but I think that so
[01:18:11] this week I happen to believe in a verse
[01:18:13] I only believe they're good no I like
[01:18:16] them this month but no I I honestly
[01:18:18] believe that this is probably a lot of
[01:18:19] fraud I had a poll Washington Post ABC
[01:18:22] in the Hillary thing on Wisconsin they
[01:18:25] had me down 17 points the day before the
[01:18:28] election I knew it was wrong because I
[01:18:30] had a rally I had 29,000 people at a
[01:18:32] racetrack and it was like Zer degrees
[01:18:35] Wisconsin and they had me down 17 points
[01:18:38] in other words you had no chance and I
[01:18:40] won and I called up my pulsers good guy
[01:18:44] good good guy and I I believe he's
[01:18:46] legitimate and you know some of them are
[01:18:48] some of them are I said tell me why did
[01:18:51] they have me down so much I mean
[01:18:53] nobody's going to believe him next time
[01:18:55] they said they don't care when you're
[01:18:57] down 17 points people are going to stay
[01:18:59] home they're not going to vote because
[01:19:01] they're going to say I love Trump but
[01:19:02] I'm not going to waste my time it's cold
[01:19:04] out I said but what do they make at four
[01:19:06] or five he said at 4 or5 they're going
[01:19:08] to go and vote at 17 they're not going
[01:19:10] to go think of it I was s this is a
[01:19:13] Washington Post ABC poll I was down 17
[01:19:16] points in Wisconsin and I
[01:19:18] won it's crooked stuff there's a lot of
[01:19:21] crooked stuff and I wanted to talk about
[01:19:23] that too because one of the things that
[01:19:25] people um talk about with you is uh the
[01:19:28] denial of the results and I think JD
[01:19:31] Vance did a brilliant job the other day
[01:19:32] when he was being interviewed uh and
[01:19:34] they they asked him did Trump lose the
[01:19:36] 2020 election and he turned it around
[01:19:38] and said was there legitimate election
[01:19:42] interference in suppressing the hunter
[01:19:44] Biden laptop story on social media and
[01:19:48] was that a concerted effort well they
[01:19:50] say make 10-point difference and I lost
[01:19:52] by one one uh
[01:19:55] tenth of a point is they say it was
[01:19:57] 22,000 votes but look it was much more
[01:20:00] than that and I appreciate jdan saying
[01:20:02] that and by the way I think he was a
[01:20:03] great pick do you like JD as a I like
[01:20:06] him a lot you're allowed to say that no
[01:20:08] I do I like him a lot I think he's
[01:20:10] brilliant guy and I think his ability to
[01:20:13] talk like a normal human being he did
[01:20:15] you did my friend Theo Von's podcast and
[01:20:17] he just did it how did he do with he did
[01:20:18] great and it he just talks like a normal
[01:20:21] human being do is that why you called me
[01:20:23] to do this no no
[01:20:25] I was uh once they shot you I was like
[01:20:27] he's got to come in here it's all about
[01:20:29] timing it's all about the timing I think
[01:20:32] timing's perfect do you even have a scar
[01:20:33] on your ear you got anything on there I
[01:20:34] do what me say say what you got so right
[01:20:37] over here it's a tiny little Mark it
[01:20:41] zied right there it's it healed up
[01:20:44] pretty good well it's pretty
[01:20:45] good yeah little it's not like uh some
[01:20:48] of the wrestlers some of the UFC
[01:20:50] fighters you didn't get no no it got it
[01:20:53] was sort of like a top shot mhm the
[01:20:55] point of the bullet was a little of the
[01:20:57] but you see the the the thing's taken
[01:20:59] off a little bit but uh it makes me a
[01:21:03] tougher guy you know the fighters you
[01:21:05] know the fighters love their you know Bo
[01:21:07] nickel is a great fighter how's he going
[01:21:09] to do I think he's Terri great he's a
[01:21:11] fantastic he was almost like undefeated
[01:21:12] in college he still yeah he's a
[01:21:14] fantastic wrestler and one of the one of
[01:21:15] the best Mixed Martial when is he
[01:21:17] fighting again he's fighting in Mass
[01:21:18] Square Garden in November oh that's
[01:21:21] going to be an after the election yep so
[01:21:23] I'll either go as president or I'll be
[01:21:25] depressed and I won't bother I really
[01:21:28] yeah I think they're having a fight
[01:21:30] right now one of the things that was
[01:21:31] fascinating also was uh the denial of
[01:21:34] the election results is is a pretty
[01:21:36] common thing Hillary Clinton famously
[01:21:38] denied that she called you an
[01:21:40] illegitimate president and she said that
[01:21:41] Russia put you in place even though she
[01:21:43] conceited yes you know she Conceited the
[01:21:45] night of the election CU she was beaten
[01:21:47] yes and it was a thing that was pretty
[01:21:50] common for people especially Democrats
[01:21:52] to deny the elections
[01:21:55] there's been many of them the Bush
[01:21:56] Administration the you know the dangling
[01:21:59] Chads all that all that stuff well look
[01:22:01] at these guys in Congress all these SAS
[01:22:03] bags in Congress that are Democrats
[01:22:04] they're still denying
[01:22:06] 2016 but now they don't so much because
[01:22:09] you know they try and pin it on me you
[01:22:10] don't hear them say here's my they
[01:22:12] denied it right up until the end my
[01:22:13] point is this idea of election fraud is
[01:22:17] a forbidden topic and you get labeled an
[01:22:20] election deny it's like being labeled an
[01:22:22] antivaxer if you question some of the
[01:22:24] health consequences that people have had
[01:22:26] from the 19 shots oh my God you're anti
[01:22:29] you're an antivaxer if you say and what
[01:22:32] I say publicly and I've said this a lot
[01:22:34] it's not
[01:22:35] 0% so if you ask me what is the amount
[01:22:38] of election fraud in this country is it
[01:22:40] 0% no one thinks it's 0% I've never met
[01:22:43] one person not a a super liberal
[01:22:47] Progressive far left person or a a
[01:22:50] right-wing conservative not one person
[01:22:52] thinks it's 0% they think when you have
[01:22:54] human beings and also you have a lot of
[01:22:57] weirdness that was going on during the
[01:22:59] 2020 elections particularly with mail
[01:23:02] and ballots and you had legislators that
[01:23:05] had to approve and they didn't approve
[01:23:07] and they went out and did it anyway and
[01:23:09] you had ballot you had old-fashioned
[01:23:11] ballot screwing I mean you had the you
[01:23:14] have people going up and dropping in
[01:23:16] phony votes you had unsigned ballots etc
[01:23:19] etc there's certain people that think
[01:23:20] they have and there's the rhetoric is
[01:23:22] also that you're Hitler and that in
[01:23:24] order to stop Hitler you have to do
[01:23:26] whatever it Tak that was okay yeah yeah
[01:23:28] and this is I mean you're hearing this
[01:23:30] now K compared you to said Your Love of
[01:23:32] Hitler yesterday it's you know KLA is a
[01:23:35] very low IQ person she's a very low IQ
[01:23:38] you know I'm for taking tests too I
[01:23:41] think anybody that runs for president
[01:23:42] should take they should give him test
[01:23:44] and it's not an age thing it's not based
[01:23:46] if you look back on History 70s and 80s
[01:23:49] your greatest some of your greatest
[01:23:50] leaders in the world world history
[01:23:52] longtime world history they were in
[01:23:55] their 70s and their 80s but I think you
[01:23:57] should take cognitive tests I think
[01:23:59] everybody they say it's
[01:24:01] unconstitutional but I think ridiculous
[01:24:03] I think Comm should have a test because
[01:24:05] there's something missing there's
[01:24:06] something wrong with her well I think
[01:24:07] it's pressure I think the pressure and
[01:24:09] the scrutiny you've been a celebrity for
[01:24:11] a long time and you understand what this
[01:24:12] is like but for someone who's in her
[01:24:15] late 40s who becomes the vice president
[01:24:17] who runs for president becomes the vice
[01:24:19] president and then all of a sudden the
[01:24:21] weight of the world is on your shoulders
[01:24:22] and there's all these people paying a
[01:24:24] lot lot of people clam up but you either
[01:24:26] have it you don't correct look this is
[01:24:29] an interview you've we've covered a lot
[01:24:30] of territory right and and you know it's
[01:24:33] fine I don't care I want to I think it's
[01:24:35] much more interesting she to do an
[01:24:38] interview with uh Al Anderson
[01:24:42] Cooper a softball crazy softball
[01:24:45] interview she took two days off and she
[01:24:47] studied and studied all day long and
[01:24:49] then she comes out with a result that
[01:24:50] was a real embarrassment that was a
[01:24:52] really bad interview she couldn't answer
[01:24:54] a question question and every question
[01:24:56] is not answered I mean like what would
[01:24:58] you do your first day in office okay
[01:25:01] I'll build a wall I won't build the wall
[01:25:03] there's a hundred things you can say
[01:25:04] just say anything right uh there's
[01:25:07] something off with her well I also we're
[01:25:09] dealing Jo we're dealing with the
[01:25:10] smartest people they hate when I say you
[01:25:13] know when the Pres when I call President
[01:25:14] she they said he called president she
[01:25:17] brilliant well he's a brilliant guy he
[01:25:18] controls 1.4 billion people with an iron
[01:25:20] fist I mean he's a brilliant guy whether
[01:25:22] you like it or not and they go crazy
[01:25:25] right it doesn't mean he's not evil or
[01:25:26] it doesn't mean he's not yeah of course
[01:25:28] dangerous but but actually we have evil
[01:25:31] people in our country yes if you have a
[01:25:33] smart president he can deal with Russia
[01:25:35] he can deal with all of it I had a i
[01:25:38] Russia would have never gotone into
[01:25:39] Ukraine if I were president how would
[01:25:41] you have stopped it he automatic two
[01:25:43] things I told him I said Vladimir you're
[01:25:46] not going in I used to talk to him all
[01:25:48] the time you're not going in I can't
[01:25:51] tell you what I told him because I think
[01:25:53] it would be appropriate but someday
[01:25:55] he'll tell you but he would have never
[01:25:57] gone in but you know why else he
[01:25:58] wouldn't have gone in oil prices at $40
[01:26:00] a barrel wouldn't have allowed him
[01:26:02] wouldn't have given him the money to
[01:26:04] prosecute that war wouldn't have given
[01:26:06] him the money I said it with President I
[01:26:09] was with President she I said it was
[01:26:11] almost the same conversation with
[01:26:14] Vladimir was
[01:26:16] Moscow with President she it was Beijing
[01:26:20] it was almost the exact same
[01:26:22] conversation I said don't do it he would
[01:26:24] have never done it the day I left they
[01:26:26] flew 28 bombers over the middle of
[01:26:29] Taiwan 28 bombers and it's the apple of
[01:26:33] his eye and the same thing with Russia
[01:26:35] it's the Apple Ukraine is the apple of
[01:26:37] his eye I used to talk to him I had a
[01:26:39] very good relationship with him he
[01:26:41] wouldn't have done it he would have
[01:26:42] never done it but he also wouldn't have
[01:26:44] done it because of the you know one of
[01:26:46] the reasons that what happened is number
[01:26:49] one he doesn't respect Biden at all not
[01:26:51] even a little bit and who the hell would
[01:26:53] but he doesn't respect him but when he
[01:26:55] saw what happened in Afghanistan how
[01:26:57] horribly that was handled number one you
[01:27:00] take the soldiers out last not first
[01:27:02] okay that was their big mistake and we
[01:27:04] had that thing charted out and they
[01:27:06] weren't obeying us they weren't uh Abdul
[01:27:09] is the head of the Taliban boom boom he
[01:27:11] had to do all these things some he
[01:27:13] didn't do I said nope you're not do you
[01:27:15] got to do them all this guy took he
[01:27:18] immediately took all he left the
[01:27:20] equipment behind 13 soldiers dead but he
[01:27:23] took everybody out he took his soldiers
[01:27:25] out before a child would know that's
[01:27:28] where Millie was so stupid he was such a
[01:27:30] stupid guy
[01:27:32] Millie okay those generals should have
[01:27:34] all been fired the Afghan the people
[01:27:37] that were involved with Afghanistan
[01:27:39] should have all been fired then they'd
[01:27:41] be writing books about him how stupid he
[01:27:43] was and bad he was but you take your
[01:27:46] soldiers out last I had a a big rally
[01:27:49] and I saw a child in the front
[01:27:52] row uh about a year and a half ago and I
[01:27:54] called the child up I said do you mind
[01:27:56] if I borrow your child oh yes please and
[01:27:59] they came up kids five years I gave them
[01:28:01] quick details you know I said we want to
[01:28:03] get out of this place and we have this
[01:28:05] and we have this and we have the
[01:28:06] equipment I gave him a little thing I
[01:28:08] said do you take your soldiers out first
[01:28:11] or last after everything's done you take
[01:28:14] them out last sir a child would know
[01:28:17] that we took our soldiers out first what
[01:28:19] was your and we left a bag room well not
[01:28:23] only that we left billions of dollars
[01:28:25] worth of equipment and military vehicles
[01:28:27] that they use for parades now best the
[01:28:29] best equipment yeah to embarrass us the
[01:28:31] best equipment in the world the Taliban
[01:28:34] parade where there got tanks rolling
[01:28:36] down the streets and Blackhawks flying
[01:28:37] is the craziest thing I've ever seen
[01:28:39] fact that we left all Best Equipment in
[01:28:41] the World Behind what would you have
[01:28:44] done differently well number one we
[01:28:46] would have taken it out just so go back
[01:28:48] a little bit further I had a couple of
[01:28:50] conversations with Abdul and from the
[01:28:53] time had those conversations cuz they
[01:28:55] were shooting our soldiers you know with
[01:28:57] the sniper stuff they were shoot they
[01:28:59] were shooting a lot of them they were
[01:29:00] shooting a lot with Obama much less with
[01:29:02] me but they were shooting him and I said
[01:29:05] get this guy on the phone the Press went
[01:29:07] nuts when they heard this I had a great
[01:29:10] conversation with it was a tough
[01:29:12] conversation 18 months later there
[01:29:14] wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at
[01:29:17] and even Biden admitted it in a moment
[01:29:19] of stupidity cuz he shouldn't admit it
[01:29:20] his people went nuts he said yeah well I
[01:29:23] will admit no Soldier we had we didn't
[01:29:25] have a soldier killed in 18 months in
[01:29:29] Afghanistan not one soldier was killed
[01:29:31] because he understood what was going to
[01:29:34] happen if that happened I didn't have
[01:29:36] one so then when I left after having
[01:29:39] gotten more votes than any sitting
[01:29:41] president in the history of the country
[01:29:43] and much more votes than he got in 2016
[01:29:46] when I
[01:29:47] left they started shooting our soldiers
[01:29:51] but more importantly what they did is
[01:29:53] they did that whole thing with you know
[01:29:55] leaving he shouldn't have left number
[01:29:57] one should have left from bogram because
[01:29:59] bogram is this massive base it's got
[01:30:02] tremendous acreage around it tremendous
[01:30:04] it's a very big it was built many years
[01:30:06] ago and part of the reason you wouldn't
[01:30:08] have taken that is because it goes to
[01:30:10] China one hour from where China makes
[01:30:12] its nuclear missiles you should have
[01:30:15] never left bogram number one they should
[01:30:18] have left from bogram they should have
[01:30:21] left last they should have got you know
[01:30:23] we have Americans that are still there
[01:30:25] they should have taken all their
[01:30:26] equipment out everything should every
[01:30:28] plane every screw should have been taken
[01:30:30] out every tent and I said that that's
[01:30:33] when I realized that Millie was a dummy
[01:30:35] I said we're leaving but I want to get
[01:30:38] everything out sirar it's cheaper to
[01:30:39] leave it I said what do you mean cheaper
[01:30:42] to leave it yeah he said it's cheaper to
[01:30:43] leave it that was cheaper cheaper he
[01:30:45] said it's cheaper sir not more dangerous
[01:30:48] he just said cheaper I said I want every
[01:30:50] plane I want every tank I want the
[01:30:52] goggles they night goggles they have all
[01:30:55] this stuff that these guys now have he
[01:30:57] said sir it's cheaper to get out and
[01:30:59] leave it I said so you think it's
[01:31:01] cheaper to leave a $150 million brand
[01:31:04] new airplane in there than it is to fly
[01:31:07] it out with a tank of jet fuel and put
[01:31:09] it in Pakistan or just fly it directly
[01:31:12] back it's cheaper to live I said this
[01:31:14] guy's nuts I'm telling you he was so
[01:31:17] stupid he was so unwise he was like an
[01:31:19] unwise man and there were a number of
[01:31:22] them but I defeated Isis with the
[01:31:25] greatest generals I had a guy who was so
[01:31:28] great I flew to Iraq and I met the real
[01:31:33] generals not these idiots that we deal
[01:31:35] with and we knocked out you know I
[01:31:38] defeated 100% of the Isis caliphate they
[01:31:42] said it would take five years I did it
[01:31:43] in a matter of a few literally a few
[01:31:47] weeks and we hit them hard and he said
[01:31:50] so we're going to hit him here we're
[01:31:51] going to hit him there we're going to
[01:31:52] hit him here there and I said this guy's
[01:31:55] great I like this guy I was told it
[01:31:57] would take five years that's why I went
[01:32:00] I said how could it take five years we
[01:32:01] have brand new Fighters we have the best
[01:32:03] planes the best weapons the best guns
[01:32:05] the best bombs how could it possibly
[01:32:07] take that long and I flew to um I flew
[01:32:12] and left at 3:00 in the morning nobody
[01:32:15] knew I was going I got on Air Force One
[01:32:17] and we started
[01:32:18] flying and when we reached about half an
[01:32:21] hour away from Iraq that was where the
[01:32:23] air Port was big
[01:32:25] airport uh about a half an hour away
[01:32:27] they said sir I'm sorry you'll have to
[01:32:29] turn off all your lights why we're
[01:32:31] getting close to our site our land I
[01:32:34] said you mean we spent 8 trillion do and
[01:32:36] we can't leave the lights think of this
[01:32:39] 20 years $8 trillion and we can't leave
[01:32:41] the lights on in a
[01:32:43] plane I said that's okay turn the lights
[01:32:45] on I'm not going to fight him that's one
[01:32:47] this is because it's too dangerous yeah
[01:32:48] too dangerous cuz they see the light up
[01:32:50] in the air they'll shoot at it you know
[01:32:52] so uh I said said turn the lights off
[01:32:55] then they said sir we're going to also
[01:32:56] pull your shades of that's okay said
[01:32:57] that's okay the plane was Pitch Black
[01:33:00] all the lights outside you know the
[01:33:01] blinking they go the blinking Reds they
[01:33:03] were all turned off and I like to sit
[01:33:06] with Pilots a lot of times and these
[01:33:08] guys are specimens I always say they're
[01:33:11] better looking than Tom Cruz okay and
[01:33:15] they're even taller like perfect
[01:33:17] specimens these guys like for a fighter
[01:33:20] you know you have some guys that are
[01:33:21] perfect specimens these and you know
[01:33:23] they picked they picked the best pilots
[01:33:25] in the Air Force United States Air Force
[01:33:27] to fly Air Force One and I get up there
[01:33:31] and I'm sitting and and I'm feeling my
[01:33:34] way up you know it's up high 7:47 so you
[01:33:36] go through the stairs but I sort of knew
[01:33:38] my way up there wasn't a light in the
[01:33:40] plan I'm saying can you imagine we spent
[01:33:43] trillions of dollars and we're trying to
[01:33:46] fly in blind but I got into the plane
[01:33:49] the cockpit is dark black little tiny
[01:33:52] light you could see the pilot
[01:33:54] a perfect looking human being his
[01:33:56] co-pilot everybody was perfect they were
[01:33:57] all like movie stars you know it's like
[01:33:59] I could have cast a movie with these
[01:34:01] guys and nobody would believe it because
[01:34:02] they were too
[01:34:03] good-look so I said how are we doing ke
[01:34:06] sure we'll be landing in 10 minutes and
[01:34:08] I look outside there's not a light and
[01:34:10] I'm saying you know I've landed a lot of
[01:34:12] planes I and you see like little lights

[01:34:56] said you know go I don't see the lights
[01:34:59] up there Captain sure we're okay you
[01:35:01] know so I mean I'm exaggerating a little
[01:35:04] bit you know Pro problem with

[01:35:30] little pin and all of a sudden and you

[01:35:39] between the equipment and it's genius

[01:35:44] see a thing there was no Runway you
[01:35:46] wouldn't know where the hell you you're
[01:35:47] in the middle of a desert and then I got
[01:35:50] out of the plane I said thank you
[01:35:51] Captain that's a great job and then I
[01:35:53] get out of the plane and I'm going down
[01:35:56] and I see a general and another General
[01:35:59] and I see a staff sergeant a drill
[01:36:01] sergeant and are various guys all
[01:36:04] Central Casting Central
[01:36:07] Casting they said sir would you like to
[01:36:10] rest I said I don't want to rest I want
[01:36:11] to figure out what the hell are we doing
[01:36:13] with Isis I'm hearing we we can't it's
[01:36:15] going to take years no sir we can do it
[01:36:18] very quickly sir and anyway we go into
[01:36:20] the room we go I mean Biden would have
[01:36:23] taken nap for 4 days and then left
[01:36:25] without a meeting so we go into the room
[01:36:27] and these they have these guys I say how
[01:36:30] long can you do it how long we can do it
[01:36:32] in a couple of weeks sir I said wait a
[01:36:34] minute they told me five years we can do
[01:36:36] it in I don't he gave me a number like
[01:36:39] like just like in no time I said why
[01:36:43] haven't you done it because the orders
[01:36:46] came in from Washington sir and they
[01:36:47] would come here and tell us what to do
[01:36:49] don't you challenge us we're not allowed
[01:36:51] to do that sir that's not the military
[01:36:53] way they tell us what to do and we have
[01:36:55] to respect them I just so do you think
[01:36:57] that it was incompetence why they didn't
[01:37:00] go after Isis I think it's a bad system
[01:37:02] you know when Mattis goes there or when
[01:37:03] Millie goes there who's stupid and they
[01:37:05] tell these guys that are actually smart
[01:37:07] what to do and the guys that are smart
[01:37:10] are saying we don't like what they're
[01:37:11] doing but they're not allowed to sort of
[01:37:13] counteract plus the guys that went there
[01:37:15] are arrogant you know they're arrogant
[01:37:17] fools they're like stupid fools uh the
[01:37:20] way they pulled out of uh you know the
[01:37:22] way they as an example the way they
[01:37:25] pulled out of Afghanistan with the
[01:37:26] people falling off the planes the it was
[01:37:29] so it was it was worse than Vietnam with
[01:37:31] the helicopters fall it was so bad there
[01:37:34] was no reason for it anyway so we
[01:37:37] knocked them out and I mean we have
[01:37:39] great military we have great people but
[01:37:42] not the television guys and I rebuilt
[01:37:45] the military and then they gave a chunk
[01:37:47] of it now I have to tell as much as it
[01:37:49] is it's a tiny little piece believe it
[01:37:51] or not we have an believe I rebuilt the
[01:37:54] military I rebuilt our nuclear and in a
[01:37:57] way I hated to redo it but I got to
[01:38:00] realize how powerful that nuclear is
[01:38:03] Joe one bomb Israel is gone but forget
[01:38:08] one bomb could take out the entire East
[01:38:10] Coast it's so bad and I watch these poor
[01:38:13] fools talking about our oceans will rise
[01:38:17] 1 18 of an inch over the next 500 years
[01:38:19] I mean we have people we have countries
[01:38:22] right now you five countries and don't
[01:38:25] underestimate North North if you take a
[01:38:28] look at North Korea their new I was
[01:38:31] there I mean I was with Kim I had a
[01:38:33] great Rel I got along great with him you
[01:38:35] know the president he got along that's a
[01:38:37] good thing it's not a bad thing it's a
[01:38:38] great thing Obama thought we were going
[01:38:40] to go to war with North Korea when I met
[01:38:43] with Obama just prior to the Takeover
[01:38:45] you know you meet you have it's a sort
[01:38:46] of a ceremonial meeting but it lasted a
[01:38:49] long time a lot longer than it was
[01:38:50] supposed to last I said what's the
[01:38:52] biggest problem he said North Korea
[01:38:55] by the time I finished I was we we had
[01:38:57] no problem with North Korea we were
[01:38:59] really it was a little tough at the
[01:39:00] beginning remember MH he said uh I have
[01:39:04] a red button on my desk I said I have a
[01:39:06] red button also but mine's bigger than
[01:39:09] yours and mine works I liked how you
[01:39:10] called them little rocket man I said I
[01:39:12] said yeah little rocket I said little
[01:39:14] rocket man you're going to burn in hell
[01:39:16] and it was a rough yeah oh so rough that
[01:39:19] people were worried this is crazy and
[01:39:21] then one day I got a call sort of like a
[01:39:23] fight I got a call you know you ever see
[01:39:26] what they pounding P then all of a
[01:39:27] sudden but I got a call and it was from
[01:39:30] him meaning his people they wanted to
[01:39:32] meet they wouldn't meet Obama he tried
[01:39:35] to meet they wouldn't even talk to him
[01:39:37] about it and I think he expected to go
[01:39:40] to war I actually do I believe he
[01:39:41] expected to go and we check their
[01:39:44] nuclear stock po it is substantial I
[01:39:46] mean it's that's I said do you do
[01:39:48] anything I got to know him very well I
[01:39:50] got to know him better than anybody
[01:39:52] anybody
[01:39:54] and I said do you ever do anything else
[01:39:55] why don't you go take it easy and relax
[01:39:57] go to the beach you have beautiful beach
[01:40:00] nice beach front property you know
[01:40:01] kiddingly I said you're always building
[01:40:03] nuclear just relax you don't have to do
[01:40:06] it let's build some condos on your
[01:40:08] Shoreline they actually have gorgeous
[01:40:09] stuff and he said uh I just have to do
[01:40:13] it because I need it for my safety ET
[01:40:15] said I got to know him very well we had
[01:40:17] no problem with him if you have a smart
[01:40:19] problem if you have a smart really the
[01:40:22] right president the smart president
[01:40:24] you're not going to have a problem and I
[01:40:26] say it to people we have a bigger
[01:40:28] problem in my opinion with the Enemy
[01:40:30] from within and it drives them crazy
[01:40:32] when I use that term but we have an
[01:40:34] enemy from within we have people that
[01:40:36] are really bad people that I really
[01:40:39] think want to make this country
[01:40:41] unsuccessful when you look at what's
[01:40:43] happening at our border Joe when you
[01:40:45] have people coming in that when when
[01:40:47] other countries are allowed to empty
[01:40:49] their prisons into our country with
[01:40:51] murderers we had
[01:40:53] ,99 murderers dropped in our country
[01:40:56] over the last three years and 15,000
[01:40:59] rapists convicted rapists yeah drug
[01:41:03] dealers drug lords that's just the ones
[01:41:05] that have been correct people from
[01:41:08] mental institutions what do you think
[01:41:10] this hundred hundreds of thousands of
[01:41:13] major criminals tougher and worse than
[01:41:17] anybody we have these we're seeing the
[01:41:19] consequences of it in San Antonio
[01:41:20] they've taken over apartment buildings
[01:41:22] in Aurora Colorado take apartment
[01:41:24] buildings these Venezuelan G just the
[01:41:26] beginning what what do you think the
[01:41:28] strategy is you know one of the things
[01:41:30] that they've said is that you uh stopped
[01:41:33] a bill from being passed but didn't that
[01:41:37] bill also include amnesty for the people
[01:41:39] that are already here Jo this is years
[01:41:41] after the fact the damage was already
[01:41:44] done but what was the bill was the it
[01:41:47] allowed 2 million people and they were
[01:41:49] going to get amnesty it was a horrible
[01:41:52] bill it didn't protect us at all but we
[01:41:55] should just tell people what the
[01:41:56] strategy is so one of the things that's
[01:41:58] been their strategy one of the things
[01:41:59] that's been very clear is that they've
[01:42:01] moved a large percentage of these
[01:42:04] migrants they're coming across the
[01:42:05] border illegally they've moved them to
[01:42:08] swing States like this is what's going
[01:42:11] on with Springfield Ohio right they're
[01:42:12] in swing States well that's not a swing
[01:42:14] state I'm going to win Ohio by a lot so
[01:42:16] that's not a but it's called Springfield
[01:42:18] Ohio to be exact and yeah Springfield
[01:42:21] Ohio is this very nice community of
[01:42:25] 52,000 people that just had
[01:42:29] 32,000 migrants that don't speak the
[01:42:31] language dropped into their Community
[01:42:35] you can't get into a hospital you can't
[01:42:36] get into a school it's gone from a
[01:42:39] beautiful little place to a horror show
[01:42:42] and the mayor is a nice guy and the
[01:42:44] mayor says we're looking for
[01:42:47] interpreters I said no you've got to
[01:42:49] remove them and bring them back to their
[01:42:51] country mostly Haitians in this cas is
[01:42:54] but they speak no they speak no language
[01:42:56] they speak no no English mean in fact
[01:42:58] even the language they do speak it's I
[01:43:00] mean they can't get interpreters they
[01:43:02] can't do anything and the mayor's trying
[01:43:03] to be politically correct they're all
[01:43:05] trying to be in Aurora Colorado you have
[01:43:08] the the worst probably the worst gang
[01:43:11] MS-13 might even be you know those two
[01:43:13] are the worst gangs these are Venezuela
[01:43:15] gangs they have taken over apartment
[01:43:18] complexes and they're going to want to
[01:43:19] take over the whole thing and you have a
[01:43:21] weak Governor pathetic Governor uh who's
[01:43:24] a radical left Democrat he doesn't know
[01:43:27] what the hell to do but you have it in
[01:43:29] many other communities but they don't
[01:43:30] like to talk about it because it's you
[01:43:32] know it's bad for the community to talk
[01:43:33] about it these people have been LED in
[01:43:36] here by this imbecile she's and I mean
[01:43:40] it she's a low IQ person low IQ right
[01:43:45] but it's also it's obviously not just
[01:43:46] her there's there's a strategy that's
[01:43:49] involved in letting these people she was
[01:43:50] in charge of the Border well she's in
[01:43:51] charge of the Border but they also they
[01:43:53] they utilize that app the app that used
[01:43:56] to be used it used to be used I think
[01:43:58] essentially wasn't it for shipping
[01:44:00] wasn't it when people were this country
[01:44:01] it was used for shipping and now it's
[01:44:03] used to deal with the cartels the cartel
[01:44:06] heads of the cartel rich people by the
[01:44:08] way these are loaded these people have
[01:44:10] so much money they would call up think
[01:44:13] of this they call up the app and the app
[01:44:16] tells them where they should take their
[01:44:19] load of illegal migrants from the Congo
[01:44:23] you know we have a lot from the Congo
[01:44:24] prisons in the
[01:44:26] Congo um I made a little bit of a
[01:44:28] sarcastic joke a man named Dana White
[01:44:30] who you love who I love I assume you
[01:44:32] love I love that dude I think he's in a
[01:44:35] class by he's probably the reason why
[01:44:37] you're
[01:44:38] here I I I don't know maybe he's one of
[01:44:41] the big ones he is the greatest guy you
[01:44:44] know I always say every nobody's
[01:44:46] indispensable you know everybody can be
[01:44:48] replaced maybe you can't be you might
[01:44:50] not be but they know what truly I don't
[01:44:52] think you know the things they sold it
[01:44:54] for 4 billion I said what a hell who the
[01:44:57] hell is going to pay 4
[01:44:59] billion and they made like a great deal
[01:45:02] I
[01:45:03] mean take him out I think it's all every
[01:45:05] no he's the
[01:45:07] best greatest guy he spoke at my at the
[01:45:10] whole thing with you know I had just
[01:45:11] been shot and he got up and he spoke so
[01:45:14] better than anybody I mean who would be
[01:45:16] better to introduce you I asked of all
[01:45:19] the people and I know the biggest people
[01:45:20] in the world and they all would have
[01:45:22] loved to have done it I said Dana would
[01:45:23] you do it you it was interesting he was
[01:45:26] away and he said to the people that you
[01:45:28] know one of my guys called said I won't
[01:45:31] be able to do it I'm she I just left
[01:45:33] with my wife and family I won't I said
[01:45:36] he said no yeah I was a little surprised
[01:45:38] even though I knew he was very far away
[01:45:39] he was in someplace some you know and
[01:45:41] and he deserved it with his family you
[01:45:43] know the whole thing and then I said all
[01:45:45] right that's let's and so we're look at
[01:45:47] who we going to get and all of a sudden
[01:45:49] she comes in sir Dana White just said
[01:45:51] he's going to do it and he's coming back
[01:45:53] in tonight he's taking you know the guy
[01:45:55] is just a incredible guy and he's like a
[01:45:58] tough Champion but loyal yeah he's got
[01:46:02] to be one of your favorite people he's
[01:46:04] one of my favorite love to death I've
[01:46:05] been friends with him for 23 years I
[01:46:08] love him so would you have um because
[01:46:10] you're what you're doing here is
[01:46:11] incredible I mean everybody tells me all
[01:46:13] I know is today I'm going you know
[01:46:15] you're and Joe Rogan people tell me like
[01:46:18] I said I say how the hell do you know
[01:46:20] that but it's it's sort of what you've
[01:46:22] done here is amazing where would you be
[01:46:25] if you didn't do the UFC stuff would you
[01:46:27] have this show do you think yeah I would
[01:46:28] still be doing it for sure yeah would be
[01:46:30] the same would it be at the same level I
[01:46:32] don't know but you would have it's hard
[01:46:34] to know I think you know one of the
[01:46:36] things that works for this show I guess
[01:46:38] is that I I'm involved in so many
[01:46:39] different things you know standup comedy
[01:46:42] UFC and all the interest that I have
[01:46:44] that lead to the podcast will you always
[01:46:46] want to do you first of all you love UFC
[01:46:49] I love it yeah you love the fights I
[01:46:50] mean I watch you you are loving it they
[01:46:52] could pay you nothing it'd be very they
[01:46:54] didn't pay me anything for the first
[01:46:55] like 13 shows I did it for free cuz they
[01:46:57] were hammering money and I became
[01:46:59] friends with Dana and my my position was
[01:47:02] you're going to give me the best seat in
[01:47:03] the house I get to sit cage side for the
[01:47:05] fights I like I'll do it and I wanted to
[01:47:07] help I was like I think these are the
[01:47:09] guys that we had always hoped for in the
[01:47:11] early days of the sport I started
[01:47:13] working for the the company in 1997 I
[01:47:15] was the before the UFC was purchased by
[01:47:17] zua which Dana work for so I I was a
[01:47:20] part of the previous owners and I only
[01:47:22] did it for a couple years it was just
[01:47:23] too much and I was losing money and it
[01:47:25] was banned from cable because of
[01:47:27] Budweiser and John McCain and you could
[01:47:29] only get it on Direct TV and so and then
[01:47:32] I came along and I gave him the S and he
[01:47:34] loves you he never forgot it he he loves
[01:47:36] you for that he talks about all the time
[01:47:37] just interrupt you for one so he they
[01:47:40] couldn't get a site because it was too
[01:47:42] dangerous and everybody was against it
[01:47:43] and they couldn't get license and I gave
[01:47:45] him the first two or three sites and
[01:47:48] they were great and by the way I went to
[01:47:50] the first fight I said I never saw
[01:47:53] anything like this it was crazy it was
[01:47:55] so good take the best fight you've ever
[01:47:56] it was like that fight right it was so
[01:47:58] good that I gave it to him again again
[01:48:00] and all of a sudden it caught on but you
[01:48:02] know when I wasn't in Vogue you know
[01:48:05] I've had time you probably never had a
[01:48:08] time but I had times when I wasn't
[01:48:09] exactly inv vog Dana they called him he
[01:48:12] said he's the greatest guy there's
[01:48:14] nobody like he said I'll never say
[01:48:17] anything bad about that guy because when
[01:48:19] I needed because they were having a hard
[01:48:21] time at the beginning they almost pulled
[01:48:22] the plug a couple of times right he said
[01:48:25] he stood up and he gave us stuff that
[01:48:27] nobody else gave us and nobody wanted
[01:48:29] anything to do and he said I will never
[01:48:33] and there was a time where it would have
[01:48:35] been very popular for him to say bad
[01:48:37] stuff about me he said the greatest
[01:48:39] stuff about me he said you're going to
[01:48:41] try and get me to say bad stuff about
[01:48:43] Trump I'm never doing it he's a very's
[01:48:45] an unusual guy very unusual guy he's a
[01:48:48] fantastic guy a perfect guy to be at the
[01:48:49] helm of something so controversial as
[01:48:51] the UFC controversial now I mean well
[01:48:54] now it's huge yeah well this was always
[01:48:56] the thing that I would hop that it would
[01:48:58] be I always knew that it was
[01:48:59] unbelievably entertaining but I just
[01:49:00] didn't know if maybe I was crazy maybe I
[01:49:03] loved it because I've had this long
[01:49:05] history of being involved in martial
[01:49:06] arts and maybe like other people just
[01:49:07] think it's too violent but can boxing
[01:49:09] make it yeah boxing still a great sport
[01:49:12] I love boxing but it seems to be so
[01:49:15] unimportant Now by comparison to UFC
[01:49:18] don't you think I think well you know
[01:49:20] Dana is working with the the kingdom of
[01:49:22] Saudi Arabia they're they're going to
[01:49:24] start promoting boxing now and with Dan
[01:49:26] at the helm of it I think boxing can
[01:49:28] return because the thing is they want to
[01:49:30] make fights that other PE maybe you know
[01:49:33] promoters don't want to make because
[01:49:35] they want to protect their fighter
[01:49:36] controversial fights where you know it's
[01:49:38] dangerous like you don't know this guy
[01:49:39] could lose and so the Saudis they're
[01:49:41] smart they just offer a tremendous
[01:49:43] amount of money and they're putting
[01:49:44] together Fighter fights that no one else
[01:49:46] can put together they're doing that in
[01:49:48] boxing if Dan is involved he'll probably
[01:49:50] make it good you know the amazing thing
[01:49:52] though the the in fighting no UFC
[01:49:55] fighter they say has ever died and it
[01:49:58] looks to me much more violent than bucks
[01:50:00] many boxers have died isn't it
[01:50:02] interesting and Dana tells me because
[01:50:03] they take so many shots to the face yes
[01:50:06] and there's also no other options to
[01:50:07] preserve yourself to protect yourself so
[01:50:09] if you get hit in a UFC fight you can
[01:50:11] clinch you can try to take the fight to
[01:50:12] the ground you get options also you
[01:50:14] don't get allowed to get knocked down
[01:50:16] and then get back up when you get
[01:50:17] knocked down you're concussed and
[01:50:19] generally you know if a guy's really
[01:50:21] hurt they could be finished in in on the
[01:50:23] ground and the fight's over if it's
[01:50:25] boxing you have 10 seconds to get up you
[01:50:28] get up your head kind of clears but
[01:50:30] you're still in real bad trouble and
[01:50:32] then you can kind of run away and
[01:50:33] survive until the bell rings they're
[01:50:35] only three minute rounds and then you
[01:50:37] start again so you're getting repeated
[01:50:38] punishment to the Head yeah you know and
[01:50:41] then there's also the issue of guys
[01:50:43] weight cutting you know which is a
[01:50:44] problem with the UFC as well but weight
[01:50:46] cutting in boxing has led to if you look
[01:50:47] at deaths in boxing there's very few of
[01:50:50] them in the heavyweight division most of
[01:50:51] the deaths in box in or the lightweight
[01:50:53] divisions because when guys dehydrate
[01:50:55] themselves to to to lose weight to make
[01:50:57] weight their brain is the last thing
[01:50:59] that gets rehydrated like it's very
[01:51:02] difficult to completely rehydrate
[01:51:04] hydrate your brain quickly and you only
[01:51:06] have 24 hours between the weighin and
[01:51:08] the fight and it used to be the
[01:51:09] weigh-ins were the day of the fight like
[01:51:12] when when boom boom manini had a fight
[01:51:14] with Duku Kim and killed him in the ring
[01:51:16] which is one of the last ones on
[01:51:17] television that we've seen that's right
[01:51:19] that was a crazy event for people and
[01:51:21] heartbreaking and it L to a bunch of
[01:51:23] different changes and one of them is day
[01:51:24] before we to allow people to rehydrate
[01:51:27] better and the other one is they dropped
[01:51:28] it from 15 rounds down to 12 which look
[01:51:32] they should do that I you know I'm not
[01:51:33] I'm not the fighter so but those 15
[01:51:36] round fights were unbelievable they were
[01:51:37] unbelievable un unbel you go back Golden
[01:51:40] Age yeah in terms of entertainment oh
[01:51:42] yeah those were the the championship RS
[01:51:45] those were the greatest fights those
[01:51:47] last three rounds were crazy I mean it's
[01:51:49] such a war of attrition you know a lot
[01:51:51] of people think even like a five round
[01:51:52] UFC fight that the UFC is f minute
[01:51:55] rounds it's so much energy you're
[01:51:57] burning out and those last couple of
[01:51:59] rounds those five round fights the
[01:52:01] fourth and the fifth round unbelievably
[01:52:03] brutal who's the greatest UFC fighter in
[01:52:05] you are you allowed to say in your
[01:52:07] opinion it's tough for you to say
[01:52:08] because you do this but who do you think
[01:52:10] is the greatest of the fighters there's
[01:52:12] there there's a lot of arguments for
[01:52:13] who's the greatest of all time you know
[01:52:16] uh John Jones most people would say he
[01:52:19] the greatest of all time never lost uh
[01:52:21] it's a there certainly a really good
[01:52:23] argument for that there's another
[01:52:24] argument for George St Pierre uh I
[01:52:27] always leave in BJ Penn in his prime
[01:52:29] Anderson Silva in his prime um you know
[01:52:32] Mighty Mouse people forget about Mighty
[01:52:34] Mouse because unfortunately he's a
[01:52:35] smaller guy he's 125 pounds flyweight
[01:52:37] Champion he's one of the greatest
[01:52:40] expressions of mixed martial arts I've
[01:52:41] ever seen I think to this day what kabib
[01:52:44] is fantastic but if you looked at like
[01:52:46] accomplishments in terms of championship
[01:52:48] fights kabib retired 29 and0 but he
[01:52:51] didn't have as many
[01:52:53] they say he might have lost to glaz and
[01:52:55] Tau he might have lost to him might have
[01:52:58] lost round and that was a controversial
[01:53:00] fight where people think that glaz and
[01:53:02] Tau could have even got the decision in
[01:53:03] that fight I'd have to go back and watch
[01:53:05] it again to make a decision but uh
[01:53:07] they're great athletes oh the best
[01:53:09] athletes in the world and the the most
[01:53:11] dangerous sport in terms of like it's I
[01:53:14] always call it highlevel problem solving
[01:53:16] with dire physical consequences it's
[01:53:18] just brutal that's what fighting is you
[01:53:20] know I I never forget so there was a
[01:53:22] fighter named James T Tony oh yeah I
[01:53:25] love James Tony he fought as a very
[01:53:27] light fighter and he ended up as a
[01:53:28] heavyweight this guy went through
[01:53:29] everything he was almost like a
[01:53:31] lightweight he went from middleweight
[01:53:32] all the way up to heavyweight yeah beat
[01:53:35] holfield as a heavyweight and he was a
[01:53:36] real fighter oh yeah so James Tony and I
[01:53:39] think it was uh St George uh George St
[01:53:43] Pierre St Pierre I think it was him who
[01:53:45] did he fight James Tony no um James Tony
[01:53:48] didn't fight George he fought a UFC
[01:53:50] fighter yeah Randy cure fought James
[01:53:52] Tony was it that was like an easy fight
[01:53:55] that was a very easy fight Randy cotour
[01:53:57] just took him down and it was the most
[01:53:58] and he's half the size and he just once
[01:54:01] he got to the ankles in fact the announc
[01:54:03] said it's over yeah took him down
[01:54:06] mounted him strangled him it was pretty
[01:54:08] he was but he was talking big because he
[01:54:09] was much bigger he was a pretty big guy
[01:54:11] think James just wanted to make some
[01:54:12] money and you think so but I never
[01:54:14] forgot it it was over very quickly and
[01:54:17] he was lying sleeping on the mat and he
[01:54:19] was talking you know he was doing the
[01:54:21] Muhammad Ali stuff but it didn't work
[01:54:22] out but I remember the fight yeah that
[01:54:24] was cure probably yeah it was cure
[01:54:26] George never fought a boxer in an MMA
[01:54:29] fight if he did he would kill him was he
[01:54:31] was he one of the greatest yes
[01:54:32] unquestionably that's the the argument
[01:54:35] there's like a handful of guys you can
[01:54:36] make the argument is the greatest of all
[01:54:37] time people forget about Anderson Silva
[01:54:39] in his prime he was Unstoppable it's but
[01:54:42] that's the thing is and then there's
[01:54:43] Fedor milliano who fought in Pride in
[01:54:45] his prime he was Unstoppable there's
[01:54:47] there's this and you have a couple now
[01:54:49] that are pretty good oh we've got so
[01:54:50] many now Alex Pereira
[01:54:52] there's an argument that he's the topfor
[01:54:54] fighter in the world now he's it's
[01:54:57] unbelievable but it's like Fighters can
[01:54:59] only compete at that level for so many
[01:55:01] years and so my opinion you have to
[01:55:03] judge them at their very Peak you can't
[01:55:05] judge them when they're hanging on and
[01:55:07] still fighting you can't judge them when
[01:55:08] they're coming up you got to judge them
[01:55:10] in that Championship peak in that
[01:55:12] Championship Peak there's a handful of
[01:55:15] guys that you would consider at the very
[01:55:16] top if they stopped a little bit sooner
[01:55:19] yeah some of them would have had you
[01:55:21] know I mean there are a couple of that
[01:55:22] you just mentioned without mentioning
[01:55:24] names and they stopped they had the
[01:55:25] perfect they were unbelievable and then
[01:55:27] at a certain age they start getting
[01:55:29] knocked out right yes it's unfortunate
[01:55:31] but the thing is that same belief in
[01:55:33] themselves that lets them become a
[01:55:34] champion makes them think that they can
[01:55:36] do it long past the time that they
[01:55:38] actually can well Anderson Silva was
[01:55:40] essentially unbeatable and then he lost
[01:55:42] a CL one and then all of a sudden he had
[01:55:44] no he got knocked out he got knocked out
[01:55:45] by Chris Weidman right uh he was kind of
[01:55:47] clowning in that fight famously and C
[01:55:49] Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook
[01:55:51] knocked him out and then they fought a
[01:55:52] second time and he broke his leg on
[01:55:54] Chris Weidman right that's right and
[01:55:56] after that fight he was kind of never
[01:55:58] the same because that that leg break
[01:56:00] injury which Conor McGregor had there's
[01:56:03] quite a few Fighters Wiman actually W up
[01:56:05] having the same injury ironically
[01:56:07] there's only been like you're never the
[01:56:08] same cuz you can't kick never the same
[01:56:10] well you can Weidman is still kicking
[01:56:12] with that leg you can but
[01:56:14] psychologically when you throw a kick
[01:56:15] and your leg snaps in half and you're in
[01:56:18] agony for a year right you have to get
[01:56:20] surgery you have to get bolts and plates
[01:56:22] keep your leg together and then it takes
[01:56:24] forever for it to heal it always amazed
[01:56:26] me how the kicker I mean you have those
[01:56:29] cases but the kicker will do tremendous
[01:56:31] damage to somebody's leg but their leg
[01:56:33] doesn't seem to get damaged isn't it
[01:56:35] sort of it does get damaged it hurts
[01:56:37] more than you yeah but your shin you you
[01:56:39] your shin gets very numb after a while
[01:56:41] and guys that are really good kickers
[01:56:43] they're kicking the thigh and they're
[01:56:45] kicking the C they kicking soft areas
[01:56:47] and they're slamming this hard numb Shin
[01:56:51] their Shin gets all these like micro
[01:56:53] fractures all over the shin and it
[01:56:55] calcifies like these guys can kick
[01:56:57] baseball bats you ever see them break
[01:56:58] baseball bats with their Shins It's
[01:57:00] Crazy some guys can do two baseball bats
[01:57:02] someone will hold the baseball bat and
[01:57:04] they just kick right through them I
[01:57:06] watch your enthusiasm now right yeah and
[01:57:08] it's like that's why you're good at what
[01:57:10] that's why nobody does this better that
[01:57:13] without the enthusiasm forget it well it
[01:57:15] has to be authentic like that I mean the
[01:57:17] only reason why I do MMA commentary is
[01:57:19] cuz I I'm very interested in it for real
[01:57:22] it's I'm not I don't have to manufacture
[01:57:24] it I'm very interested so I and you love
[01:57:26] going in there after the fight and
[01:57:28] they're sweating all over you they're
[01:57:29] slopping all over you you're B on
[01:57:31] they're bleeding does that bother you a
[01:57:34] little bit Yeah like two weeks ago with
[01:57:36] a guy was he I never saw Round Tree yeah
[01:57:39] he more stuff came out of his nose yes
[01:57:41] it was pretty nasty but no I'm very used
[01:57:43] to it I just wanted him to be able to
[01:57:45] express himself you've done a great job
[01:57:47] thank you you've done a great job so
[01:57:49] back to you and back to what what are
[01:57:52] you and first of all I love this idea of
[01:57:55] you teaming up with Robert Kennedy right
[01:57:57] and I love this make America healthy
[01:57:59] again idea because there are chemicals
[01:58:02] and ingredients and in our food that are
[01:58:05] illegal in other countries because
[01:58:06] they've been shown to be toxic there's
[01:58:10] pesticides and herbicides and there's a
[01:58:12] lot of that's been sprayed on our
[01:58:14] food that really is unnecessary and
[01:58:16] there's a lot of Health consequences
[01:58:18] that people are suffering from a lot of
[01:58:20] these things and to chart for you
[01:58:22] beautiful because I had a feeling you'd
[01:58:24] be asking me look at this chart these
[01:58:26] are healthier countries look where the
[01:58:28] United States is I'm going to send this
[01:58:29] to RFK Junior look so this is uh well
[01:58:34] something along the I was actually
[01:58:35] talking to RFK today and he told me that
[01:58:38] more than 70% of young men are
[01:58:41] ineligible for the military because of
[01:58:43] their health I could say it that's a lot
[01:58:47] of it's obesity so here's the life
[01:58:48] expectancy vers versus Health
[01:58:50] expenditure same
[01:58:52] yeah did you see that USA that's pretty
[01:58:55] good Jam's the best he's very good he's
[01:58:57] the best no but look at that look at the
[01:58:59] US not good and that's our food that's
[01:59:02] our diet that's that's sedentary
[01:59:04] lifestyle that's our diet that's the
[01:59:05] chemicals we ingest that's what that is
[01:59:08] but RFK is going to be very you know I
[01:59:10] think he's a great guy I I love the fact
[01:59:13] that you guys teamed up and are you guys
[01:59:15] are you completely committed to have him
[01:59:17] a part of your Administration oh I am
[01:59:19] but the only thing I want to be a little
[01:59:20] careful about with him is
[01:59:22] uh the environmental because you know he
[01:59:24] doesn't like oil I love oil and gas I
[01:59:26] think you know I think keep him out of
[01:59:28] that to fire so I'm going to sort of
[01:59:29] keep him out of a little I said focus on
[01:59:31] health Focus you can do whatever you
[01:59:33] want but I got to be a little bit
[01:59:35] careful with the liquid gold you know I
[01:59:38] understand um but listen there's plenty
[01:59:40] of good work that could be done if you
[01:59:41] focus on health here's the one that
[01:59:43] here's the one that my all-time favorite
[01:59:45] though see the arrow right here that's
[01:59:47] what I left do you have anyone that is
[01:59:49] pressuring you to not work with him have
[01:59:52] have there been people RFK Jr there yes
[01:59:57] I would imagine because financially he
[01:59:59] could put it I would say that and you
[02:00:02] know the I think in many ways they've
[02:00:05] done a good job and many ways they've
[02:00:06] done a bad job but I would say that the
[02:00:08] uh big
[02:00:10] Pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard
[02:00:12] that you don't have a Rel I've actually
[02:00:15] always gotten along very well with him
[02:00:16] I've known him a long time he's a
[02:00:18] different kind of a guy he's very smart
[02:00:20] great guy and he's very sincere about
[02:00:23] this I mean he really is you know he
[02:00:24] thinks we we spend a fortune on
[02:00:27] pesticides and all this stuff and then
[02:00:28] you end up with that chart is a terrible
[02:00:30] chart the one previous it's such a bad
[02:00:33] chart when you look at where we are
[02:00:35] compared to other countries that don't
[02:00:36] spend 10 cents so you know and you save
[02:00:39] a lot of money but yeah we I've had some
[02:00:41] people that aren't exactly
[02:00:43] thrilled you can imagine right sure it's
[02:00:45] a good question actually well certainly
[02:00:48] if there have it doesn't affect me some
[02:00:50] pharmaceutical drugs that have been
[02:00:52] prescribed that have negative
[02:00:53] consequences that these people have been
[02:00:55] profiting off of and then you have a guy
[02:00:57] like RFK Jr who spends an enormous
[02:01:00] amount of time highlighting those things
[02:01:01] you could say how they' be very
[02:01:02] reluctant to have you support him I
[02:01:05] would say that's an understatement yes
[02:01:07] yeah so how what do you do to stop that
[02:01:09] from getting in the way well look
[02:01:12] they've come up with some amazing things
[02:01:14] I mean I don't know how you feel I know
[02:01:16] you're against the VAC certain vaccines
[02:01:18] but like the polio vaccine people had
[02:01:21] Polio they were it was like a
[02:01:23] disaster and they came up Dr sulk and he
[02:01:26] came up with a vaccine and there's no
[02:01:28] polio now it very interesting there
[02:01:30] hasn't been polio but now in the Gaza
[02:01:32] Strip can you believe that have you
[02:01:33] heard that there's been a big strain of
[02:01:36] polio coming out in the Gaza Strip is it
[02:01:38] vaccine derived polio because you know
[02:01:40] there's there's a strain of polio that
[02:01:42] comes directly from the vaccine because
[02:01:44] unfortunately sometimes you vaccinate
[02:01:45] people for poo see I haven't heard that
[02:01:48] yeah yeah I mean all I can do is I sit
[02:01:51] down and listen to him and and I'll give
[02:01:53] it a total I would love him to be right
[02:01:56] because it's if he's right it's a lot
[02:01:58] less expensive generally there two
[02:02:00] things that people point to when they
[02:02:02] point to uh the the dangers of uh the
[02:02:05] pharmaceutical drug industry one thing
[02:02:08] is when pharmaceutical drugs were
[02:02:09] allowed to advertise on television we're
[02:02:12] only one of two countries in the world
[02:02:14] that allow pharmaceutical drugs to
[02:02:15] advertise on TV the other one's New
[02:02:17] Zealand but they're they're more
[02:02:18] restrictive than we are people are those
[02:02:21] ads Those ads you hear like you know
[02:02:23] take a certain drug and then you hear
[02:02:24] all theen it causes cancer and boldness
[02:02:27] we don't like boldness this and that and
[02:02:29] iight and you can lose your vision and
[02:02:31] you know I just I actually asked one of
[02:02:33] these guys I would never take I me
[02:02:35] because there's things that are so bad
[02:02:37] they go through a whole list I guess
[02:02:38] they save some liability but man I said
[02:02:41] does that affect the purchase and they
[02:02:43] say it really does when they when
[02:02:46] there's something you have and you read
[02:02:49] and then they go through the list of
[02:02:51] side effects potential side it's not
[02:02:52] even the potential side effects I mean a
[02:02:55] lot of people are just I I asked that
[02:02:58] question people hear that when I hear it
[02:03:01] I I'm going to take a p that says may
[02:03:03] affect your vision may cause blindness
[02:03:06] may this yes and but well I know you're
[02:03:08] aware of call and Casey means right yes
[02:03:10] well one of one of the things that they
[02:03:11] pointed out and this is a very important
[02:03:13] thing for people to understand is what a
[02:03:15] lot of these drugs do is they they act
[02:03:20] to to some or another mitigate the
[02:03:22] effects of poor metabolic Health uh but
[02:03:25] most of these problems that these people
[02:03:27] are suffering from wouldn't exist if we
[02:03:29] put an emphasis on metabolic Health if
[02:03:32] people got healthier they started eating
[02:03:34] nutritious food and taking vitamins a
[02:03:36] whole host of these problems that people
[02:03:38] are having would go away and the problem
[02:03:41] with that from the pharmaceutical drug
[02:03:43] standpoint is they wouldn't be able to
[02:03:44] sell drugs to these people and this is a
[02:03:46] fear the pesticides and things like that
[02:03:49] on the plants and the what do you think
[02:03:51] of that it's terrible well I think
[02:03:53] regenerative agriculture unfortunately
[02:03:55] is very difficult to scale to a point
[02:03:57] where you got a Jack In The Box on every
[02:03:58] corner that's right if everybody wants
[02:03:59] food and we have food deserts and we
[02:04:01] have places like Los Angeles where no
[02:04:03] one's growing anything and everything
[02:04:04] has to be shipped in and it's very
[02:04:07] difficult to feed that many people we've
[02:04:09] created this incredible Society where we
[02:04:11] have these enormous cities but it's in
[02:04:13] it's very difficult to get food to these
[02:04:15] people and then for a lot of these
[02:04:17] people in lowincome areas the only food
[02:04:19] that's available is cheap unhealthy F
[02:04:22] that's right and we could fix that that
[02:04:25] that's if we could send $175 billion to
[02:04:27] Ukraine we could do something to fix a
[02:04:29] lot of the health problems that the
[02:04:31] United States has and I think it would
[02:04:33] it would help us as a nation overall
[02:04:36] just if you just put it out there that
[02:04:38] hey as a nation we're going to make a
[02:04:40] concerted effort to get people healthier
[02:04:42] just put it out there and people start
[02:04:44] making better choices well when you look
[02:04:46] at that chart I I was I just they just
[02:04:48] gave me that chart because they said you
[02:04:49] may want to discuss this topic which I
[02:04:51] know is a big topic for you and when I
[02:04:54] looked at that chart and I looked at how
[02:04:55] unhealthy we are as a nation that's a
[02:04:57] that's a pretty big thing how are you so
[02:05:00] healthy is it golf no it's genetics I
[02:05:03] believe you know I'm a big gentics has a
[02:05:05] big factor I really am I mean my father
[02:05:07] was uh unfortunately it is a big factor
[02:05:11] for health some people are just way more
[02:05:12] robust but you do play golf a lot and
[02:05:15] that is both of my parents it it's for
[02:05:17] me it's good fres it really is it's
[02:05:20] fresh you're outside um
[02:05:22] even mentally you're focused on that
[02:05:23] three-footer and for some for a couple
[02:05:25] of hours you're not and I go quick I
[02:05:27] play Fast real fast and I'm I'm in I'm
[02:05:30] out but you know it gives me I was never
[02:05:32] one that could like run on a treadmill I
[02:05:34] just and I can do it you know when
[02:05:36] passing a physical they asked me to run
[02:05:39] on a treadmill and then they make it
[02:05:40] steeper and steeper and
[02:05:42] steeper and the doctor said it was at
[02:05:44] Walter re they said it's unbelievable I
[02:05:48] could have got I'm telling you I felt I
[02:05:49] could have gone all day but I I said doc
[02:05:52] I can do this all day long I'm not I
[02:05:54] have no problem but it's boring to me do
[02:05:57] you understand it's just boring golf's
[02:05:59] exciting but I did it for so long they
[02:06:01] couldn't believe it that I did it and I
[02:06:03] never you know I don't do it I don't
[02:06:05] really you know I have friends who run
[02:06:06] in this stuff all day long but I had no
[02:06:08] problem doing it but it's really boring
[02:06:11] so with with golf or something you know
[02:06:13] or tennis or whatever but golf as you
[02:06:16] get older there's something really good
[02:06:18] about it and you have competition with
[02:06:19] yours
[02:06:22] it's a great handicap Sport and it's
[02:06:24] also a thing I think that's uh it cleans
[02:06:26] your mind because when you're looking at
[02:06:28] a a shot that's all you can think of
[02:06:30] when you're executing it gives you a
[02:06:32] couple of you know it's interesting like
[02:06:33] with tennis if you're much better than
[02:06:36] somebody you can't really play with
[02:06:37] somebody you know it doesn't work you
[02:06:39] can give them sort of the equivalent of
[02:06:41] Strokes right but it's not the with golf
[02:06:44] you can play with a lousy guy and give
[02:06:45] him a stroke a hole or two strokes a
[02:06:47] hole or something you know it's a good
[02:06:48] handicapping sport but it gives me a
[02:06:50] little exercise but I haven't played uh
[02:06:52] in a long time I won a lot of I won 32
[02:06:54] Club championships can didn't you play
[02:06:56] right after you got shot uh no where I
[02:07:00] what I did is I played with Bryson D
[02:07:03] Shambo do you know Bryson yes the pro
[02:07:05] uhhuh he's a great player and we played
[02:07:09] it was a certain thing that we played I
[02:07:11] guess called breaking 50 or something 50
[02:07:13] we play From a Certain te and if you can
[02:07:15] break 50 and it got tremendous ratings
[02:07:18] sort of like a crazy thing it got he's a
[02:07:21] great guy but wasn't that like a couple
[02:07:23] of days after you got shot I don't know
[02:07:25] I I know I that was one of the funniest
[02:07:27] things you were on the golf course I
[02:07:29] think I did yeah maybe I did but I you
[02:07:32] know I view it very interestingly I'm
[02:07:34] running for president of the United
[02:07:37] States to me it's such a big deal it's
[02:07:39] so important so I've got now the biggest
[02:07:42] deal in the Free World it's it's a
[02:07:44] hundred times bigger than the Super Bowl
[02:07:45] and it's one person yeah so you're down
[02:07:48] to two people and we start off at 9
[02:07:53] billion cuz you have nine PE 9 billion
[02:07:55] they say in the world who knows what
[02:07:57] that number is but you get down to 350
[02:08:00] million sadly we have no idea what we
[02:08:02] have in this country but let's assume
[02:08:03] it's 325 350 and you're down to two
[02:08:06] people it's a biggest thing in the world
[02:08:09] and when I heard she took off yesterday
[02:08:11] and she took off the day before and
[02:08:13] she's going to take off tomorrow or the
[02:08:14] next day I haven't taken a day off in
[02:08:18] 56 days that's a long time I haven't
[02:08:20] taken one day off I don't I didn't I
[02:08:23] don't want to play golf this is too
[02:08:25] exciting golf is great but this is too
[02:08:28] exciting this is more exciting than
[02:08:30] anything you can do and the also it's
[02:08:32] the home
[02:08:32] stretch it's the home stretch who would
[02:08:35] take a day off so we have 11 days left
[02:08:38] now and think of it so I think I've gone
[02:08:42] 54 55 days in a row no days off and I
[02:08:45] make speeches often times you know
[02:08:47] sometimes not but I make speeches and
[02:08:49] when you make a speech am my speeches
[02:08:51] last a long time because of the weave
[02:08:53] you know I mean I weave stories into it
[02:08:55] and if you don't if you just read a
[02:08:56] teleprompter nobody's going to be very
[02:08:59] excited you got to weave it out so you
[02:09:01] but you always have to as you say you
[02:09:02] always have to get right back to where
[02:09:04] yeah otherwise it's no good but the
[02:09:05] weave is very very important very few
[02:09:08] Weavers around but it's a big strain on
[02:09:12] your you know it's a big it's a lot of
[02:09:14] work it's a lot of work uh you got to be
[02:09:17] careful of the voice you can lose that
[02:09:18] voice The Voice wasn't designed I said
[02:09:20] today so I made a big one last night I
[02:09:24] was in Las Vegas big one the night
[02:09:27] before in Arizona big one I mean they're
[02:09:30] all big we have the there's never been
[02:09:33] anything like it in terms of crowd never
[02:09:35] been close never been close they say he
[02:09:38] talks about crowd says you know what's
[02:09:40] very interesting so we get crowds that
[02:09:43] are really big and I say you know I've
[02:09:48] never had a story because I don't get
[02:09:49] good press I don't think I've had a good
[02:09:51] story in years I really don't I don't I
[02:09:53] swear I don't think I you you were
[02:09:54] talking about it a little bit with Oprah
[02:09:56] everybody loved me I don't think I
[02:09:58] became president of the United
[02:10:00] States I did great the second time I did
[02:10:03] much better I I don't want to get you in
[02:10:05] in any disputes but I won that second
[02:10:08] election so easy and not just because of
[02:10:11] but let me let me get to that let's I
[02:10:12] want to talk to you about that but
[02:10:13] here's the thing I did that and now I've
[02:10:15] gotten the nomination again and don't
[02:10:17] forget to get these nominations you go
[02:10:19] against very smart people Ronda Sanz was
[02:10:22] hot got to go through him uh Nikki Haley
[02:10:25] was hot had to go through her I went
[02:10:27] through everybody record time right
[02:10:29] record time I got three nominations a
[02:10:33] row uh won the first time did much
[02:10:36] better the second time you know I get
[02:10:38] millions of votes more the second time
[02:10:40] and now I'm doing it a third time and
[02:10:42] and it's an incredible thing I never get
[02:10:45] a good story I only get bad press now I
[02:10:48] will say this it's a lot easier if
[02:10:50] you're a Democrat if I were a Democrat
[02:10:53] you get a lot of positive PRS I would
[02:10:54] get a lot of positive PR no it's a it's
[02:10:56] a creepy corrupt business and the the
[02:10:58] media to a large extent acts as a
[02:11:00] propaganda arm for the Democratic party
[02:11:02] it's not it's not even believable yeah
[02:11:04] it's believe I mean it's bizarre to
[02:11:06] watch and mo you know most young people
[02:11:08] I think are aware of it I think most
[02:11:10] Boomers still unfortunately read the
[02:11:12] newspapers and believe in CNN but it's
[02:11:14] getting younger let me tell you it's
[02:11:17] getting for us for a conservative and
[02:11:20] you know I don't myself the Internet
[02:11:22] it's cuz the internet's giving people
[02:11:24] information that they're not getting
[02:11:25] from anywhere else and they like the the
[02:11:27] very fine people hoax the Russia gate
[02:11:30] hoax all these different things they've
[02:11:31] done they tried to pin on you that's
[02:11:33] like it's a clear Distortion of what you
[02:11:36] actually said the blood bath hooks I was
[02:11:38] talking about the Auto industry it's a
[02:11:41] blood bath because Japan and and China
[02:11:45] are taking our Auto and I said it's a
[02:11:47] blood bath they said ah he used the word
[02:11:49] blood bath think it's going to be a
[02:11:51] blood bath because they're going to take
[02:11:53] over that's exact terrible thing they do
[02:11:55] but that's the problem with propagandist
[02:11:57] cuz they take things out of context and
[02:11:59] of ultimately what they do is they
[02:12:00] diminish their own credibility because
[02:12:02] people don't want to listen to anymore
[02:12:04] because they see that they've done that
[02:12:05] and they recognize what's going on and
[02:12:07] they feel insulted they're intelligence

[02:13:04] at and scolded they're they're tired of
[02:13:06] these people that they think are
[02:13:07] mentally ill telling them what the moral
[02:13:09] standards of society should be today
[02:13:11] people are upset it's a big there's a
[02:13:13] big difference now even in just a couple
[02:13:15] of years I was shaking hands with people

[02:13:35] they're Pro censorship online they're
[02:13:38] they're talking about regulating free
[02:13:40] speech and they regulating the First
[02:13:42] Amendment it's bananas to watch Joe they
[02:13:44] come after their political opponent well
[02:13:47] they I got more guys I always say you
[02:13:50] know I kid but I'm not kidding I've been
[02:13:52] investigated more than alons Capone he
[02:13:55] was the meanest of them all he'd kill
[02:13:56] you in two seconds if he didn't like you
[02:13:58] right I've been under investigation more
[02:14:01] than alons Capone only because it's
[02:14:04] political opponent stuff and I've won I
[02:14:06] won the big case in Florida I I'm
[02:14:08] winning the other stuff you win but you
[02:14:10] know what they did they did something
[02:14:12] that's only done in third world
[02:14:13] countries they came after their
[02:14:15] political opponent I could have put
[02:14:17] crooked Hillary in jail well not only
[02:14:18] that but they're they weaponizing it by
[02:14:21] saying that that's what you're going to
[02:14:22] do once you get in office ignoring what
[02:14:25] they're doing right now it's crazy I
[02:14:27] heard it somebody was defending me today
[02:14:30] say no that's they say that's what
[02:14:32] you're doing to him they're going he's
[02:14:34] going to put us in jail he's going to
[02:14:36] invest they said what you're that's what
[02:14:38] you're doing to him a lot of people say
[02:14:40] will you do that will you do that to him
[02:14:43] if to them if you win you know it's the
[02:14:45] presidency has tremendous power I could
[02:14:48] have put crooked Hillary I respected
[02:14:50] that you didn't because what you said
[02:14:52] was it would be bad for the country no I
[02:14:54] can't I couldn't even imagine you have
[02:14:56] first of all Secretary State but more
[02:14:57] importantly the wife of the president of
[02:14:59] the United States of America going into
[02:15:03] jail and if you ever saw when I'd say
[02:15:05] something about her they all say I
[02:15:07] didn't say it I never said it they say
[02:15:09] lock her up lock her up and I'd always
[02:15:10] go take it easy just relax we're going
[02:15:13] to win this thing take it easy take it
[02:15:14] easy and I'm telling you I kept it down
[02:15:17] just the opposite now they say oh Trump
[02:15:19] wanted to put her in jail no I saved her
[02:15:21] from going to jail they had more stuff
[02:15:23] on her and Comey had it because when
[02:15:26] Comey got up and he stupidly because
[02:15:29] he's a stupid guy too he goes a he's a
[02:15:31] stupid son of a he got up Joe he
[02:15:34] got up and instead of saying she's
[02:15:36] innocent of all charges he went over
[02:15:39] each charge and each charge was a killer
[02:15:43] and he go and as far as her doing
[02:15:46] this she's innocent and this and then
[02:15:49] she's only a unfair Pro secutor for
[02:15:51] would go but every time you heard these
[02:15:54] charges they sounded so bad they were
[02:15:56] bad and all it was is he wanted more air
[02:16:00] time if he would have gone up and said
[02:16:03] I've thoroughly investigated Hillary
[02:16:06] Clinton and she's done nothing that we
[02:16:08] feel is wrong it would have ended
[02:16:11] instead he wanted to be up there because
[02:16:12] he's a he's a PR Hound he's a hog and he
[02:16:17] starts going through the and you know
[02:16:18] what he had they had a huge problem
[02:16:20] because FBI is great the people there
[02:16:23] not the top people the people the real
[02:16:26] people the people that work there it's
[02:16:27] like the real generals that I told you
[02:16:29] about that defeated Isis in record time
[02:16:32] the FBI guys are great I'll bet you I'd
[02:16:34] be at 95% in the FBI I bet that's right
[02:16:38] underneath yeah and and so here's the
[02:16:40] thing so he goes with Hillary and
[02:16:42] instead of just saying he goes through
[02:16:44] each charge right and even I was saying
[02:16:47] man those are bad charges sounds
[02:16:49] terrible cuz
[02:16:51] those chares don't forget this is before
[02:16:52] I got there now he was trying to protect
[02:16:55] her but he did her a great disservice
[02:16:58] because he wanted attention he was
[02:16:59] stupid so I want to I want to talk about
[02:17:01] 2020 because you said over and over
[02:17:03] again that you were robbed in 2020
[02:17:06] totally what how do you think you were
[02:17:08] robbed everybody always cuts you off I'm
[02:17:10] G to allow well they not only cut you
[02:17:12] off well what I'd rather do is we'll do
[02:17:14] it another time and I would bring in
[02:17:15] papers that you would not believe so
[02:17:18] many different papers
[02:17:20] that election was so crooked it was the
[02:17:23] most crooked election okay but give me
[02:17:25] some examples of how well let's start
[02:17:27] let's start from the top and the easy
[02:17:28] ones okay they were supposed to get
[02:17:30] legislative approval to do the things
[02:17:33] they did and they didn't get it in many
[02:17:35] cases they didn't get it what things
[02:17:38] anything legis approval like for
[02:17:40] extensions of the voting for for for
[02:17:42] voting earlier for this all different
[02:17:45] things by law they had to get
[02:17:47] legislative approvals you don't have to
[02:17:49] go any further than that if you take a
[02:17:51] look at
[02:17:53] Wisconsin uh they virtually admitted
[02:17:56] that the election was rigged robbed and
[02:17:59] stolen they wouldn't give access in
[02:18:02] certain areas to the ballots because the
[02:18:05] ballots were in signed they weren't
[02:18:08] Originals they were we could go into
[02:18:10] this stuff we could go into the ballots
[02:18:12] or we could go into the overall I'll
[02:18:14] give you another one are you going to
[02:18:15] present this ever uh like do you do you
[02:18:20] think like just give you one more
[02:18:22] before 51 intelligence Agents come up
[02:18:27] that the laptop was from Russia it
[02:18:30] turned out to be totally false 51 Former
[02:18:33] Intelligence agents right they say that
[02:18:35] made I don't believe it's this much but
[02:18:37] it doesn't have to I won by like I lost
[02:18:40] by like I didn't lose but they say I
[02:18:43] lost Joe they say I lost by 22,000 votes
[02:18:46] that's like one tenth of 1% less than
[02:18:50] that it's a tiny little thing 22,000
[02:18:53] votes spread over the that's spread over
[02:18:55] this this period so 51 intelligence
[02:18:59] agents lied they lied they lied they
[02:19:02] knew it was it was Hunters it was from
[02:19:05] his bed it was Hunter's laptop they said
[02:19:08] it was created by Russia Russia Russia
[02:19:11] it was the Russia hooks the Russia hooks
[02:19:13] was a big HX it was all a big hook so
[02:19:16] well that's clear one example that is a
[02:19:18] good examp that's a big example they say
[02:19:20] it made a 17o difference that's a big
[02:19:22] example but that's only one and you can
[02:19:26] go into the ballots where they wouldn't
[02:19:27] give you access to the ballots you could
[02:19:30] go into the ballot harvesting you could
[02:19:32] go into $500 million for the lock boxes
[02:19:36] but just in terms of narrative so
[02:19:37] there's two things right there's the
[02:19:39] Russia hoax there's the collusion with
[02:19:41] Russia that was never proven right
[02:19:43] that's one well it no it's proven it
[02:19:44] didn't happen right right but but they
[02:19:47] they talked about it on telev two and a
[02:19:49] half years to prove but not only that
[02:19:51] but it was a constant narrative on
[02:19:52] television so that's a constant
[02:19:54] narrative that gets into people's minds
[02:19:56] especially lwi information people that
[02:19:57] just watch the news that you're in
[02:19:59] collusion with Russia so that's one so
[02:20:01] that changes the narrative and then you
[02:20:02] have the 51 Former Intelligence agents
[02:20:05] that work with the original Twitter and
[02:20:08] get them to remove links you can't share
[02:20:10] it on DMS you cannot share that story
[02:20:13] they they swept that story because they
[02:20:15] said it was Russian disinformation even
[02:20:17] though they knew it was not so that's
[02:20:20] two examples that are real examples now
[02:20:23] anyone who considers himself a
[02:20:25] legitimate objective Observer of
[02:20:28] American politics if you really want the
[02:20:30] best person to win you would want people
[02:20:33] to not lie and the only reason why they
[02:20:36] got away with this lie was because they
[02:20:38] continually labeled you as this horrible
[02:20:40] threat to democracy and Hitler they kept
[02:20:43] saying you're going to be a dictator
[02:20:44] ignoring the fact that you wer a
[02:20:46] dictator for the four years where you
[02:20:49] actually the president I was actually
[02:20:50] the opposite of a dictator I was a very
[02:20:52] straight guy but look those three things
[02:20:55] you take those three things each one of
[02:20:57] them by themselves causes the result to
[02:20:59] be different okay it does and then you
[02:21:01] can go into a hundred other things there
[02:21:03] are so many we can't have corrupt
[02:21:06] elections and we can't have open borders
[02:21:08] we need a we need you need to have a
[02:21:09] country you need borders you need Fair
[02:21:13] elections and I'll tell you the other
[02:21:14] thing you need is you need a free and
[02:21:17] fair press one of the things I like
[02:21:18] about doing a show like this can can you
[02:21:20] imagine kamla doing this show I could
[02:21:23] imagine her doing lay she be laying on
[02:21:25] the floor she was supposed to do it and
[02:21:27] she might still do it and I hope she
[02:21:29] does I will talk to her like a human
[02:21:31] being I will try to have kind of an
[02:21:33] interview with you I hope she does
[02:21:36] because it would be a mess she'd be
[02:21:38] laying on the floor com she' you'd be
[02:21:40] saying call in the Medics I think we'd
[02:21:42] have a fine conversation I think I'd be
[02:21:44] able to talk to her I wouldn't try to
[02:21:45] interview her I just try to have a
[02:21:46] conversation with her and hopefully get
[02:21:48] to know her as a human being that was my
[02:21:50] goal
[02:21:51] having her on trying to get her to
[02:21:52] express herself just as I don't know if
[02:21:54] these I don't think these formats are
[02:21:56] good I don't think that two people first
[02:21:59] of all I hate the idea of the
[02:22:00] presidential debates because I hate the
[02:22:02] idea of a Time limitation on complex
[02:22:04] ideas also you have to break I think you
[02:22:06] have to have the debates to right but
[02:22:08] the way they do the debates I think is
[02:22:10] the wrong way to do it I think they
[02:22:11] should have a conversation I think you
[02:22:14] and comma you sit across a table with no
[02:22:17] one in the room but the two of you of
[02:22:19] course you're not going to shout each
[02:22:20] other of course you're not going to
[02:22:21] insult I mean it may get they used to it
[02:22:25] wouldn't but that would be the way to do
[02:22:26] it they used to do it that way cameras
[02:22:28] on you with no no one interfering with
[02:22:32] press with with checking whether or not
[02:22:34] it's factual especially when it's biased
[02:22:37] because they checked you all those times
[02:22:38] and they didn't check her with clearly
[02:22:40] things that were inaccurate right so
[02:22:43] have two people just have a conversation
[02:22:45] with without a time constraint and also
[02:22:48] this idea they cut off the the the
[02:22:50] microphone no crowd no crowd crazy too
[02:22:53] because you're good at working a crowd I
[02:22:55] would rather have a crowd of course you
[02:22:56] would you're good at crowds but I had no
[02:22:58] so they gave me an alternative I don't
[02:23:00] think he wanted to debate why did they
[02:23:02] want no crowd what was the AR I think
[02:23:04] they thought I wasn't going to accept it
[02:23:05] so I believe what they wanted to do is
[02:23:07] have me not accept so they gave me a
[02:23:09] deal I couldn't refuse and I said I'll
[02:23:12] do it okay it's like the mob right I'll
[02:23:15] take it so they came to me they said
[02:23:19] we'll debate Joe Biden you know that
[02:23:21] thing got tremendous ratings to that was
[02:23:23] crazy but we'll debate Joe Biden but you
[02:23:26] can't have a crowd they also wanted
[02:23:29] sitting down I said that's the only
[02:23:30] thing I said look you got to you got to
[02:23:32] stand up you can't really sit down you
[02:23:33] know in the old days they did sit down a
[02:23:35] little bit but but he gets tired you got
[02:23:37] to stand up and they agreed to it it was
[02:23:40] a very tough thing it almost killed it
[02:23:42] they wanted to they wanted to have like
[02:23:44] desks we we sit I said I think we should
[02:23:46] stand up and that was the only thing I
[02:23:48] asked for I said we got to stand up
[02:23:51] I I thought it looked bad for like the
[02:23:54] public but they said no crowd and cut
[02:23:56] off the mic and I said I can live with
[02:23:59] it I mean I could live with it and they
[02:24:01] thought I was going to reject it and
[02:24:03] then they would say he didn't want to
[02:24:04] debate sleepy Joe right that's what they
[02:24:07] thought was going well they tried to say
[02:24:08] that with you and KLA as well they tried
[02:24:10] to say that you didn't want to debate
[02:24:11] her as well no by the way with her
[02:24:13] number one I'm leading number two you
[02:24:15] know I didn't they also said it with the
[02:24:17] primary so I
[02:24:18] had like 10 12 guys right in the primary
[02:24:22] no stupid guys I mean you know they
[02:24:24] Governors and they Center they're not
[02:24:25] stupid people some are stupid but not
[02:24:27] all of them and all my guys said you
[02:24:30] have to be in the debate I said why I'm
[02:24:32] leading by 74 points the closest guy to
[02:24:36] me I'm I'm like 60 points 70 points
[02:24:39] higher why would I stand there like an
[02:24:41] idiot for two hours and let every one of
[02:24:43] them scream at me I'm going to be the
[02:24:45] focus what right and I said I'm not
[02:24:47] debating and it was a very smart thing
[02:24:49] because you know
[02:24:51] it was they just killed themselves the
[02:24:52] Republican primary yeah the Republican
[02:24:54] primaries um with I like debating I
[02:24:58] think de I think you have to debate but
[02:25:00] I like I like debating the like the
[02:25:03] Rosie O'Donnell debate I like debating
[02:25:05] when you have a g remember the rosie
[02:25:08] funny crazy thing Megan that was a hell
[02:25:10] of a question man if I didn't come up
[02:25:12] with that answer well what it was is you
[02:25:16] know that was we had 28,000 people that
[02:25:18] was the Cleveland Arena where the
[02:25:19] Cavaliers played right LeBron James I'm
[02:25:22] not a big fan of LeBron James but he is
[02:25:24] a good basketball player but you know
[02:25:26] that was the and when I said that the
[02:25:29] place went crazy and she kept talking no
[02:25:32] she had like 10 other yeah well Megan
[02:25:34] said you said it to other people and you
[02:25:35] admitted you did but it was funny it was
[02:25:38] it was a comedic timing moment it was
[02:25:40] fun that's what they wanted it was lucky
[02:25:42] I did it because she was drown oh she
[02:25:45] wasn't F that question but she kept
[02:25:47] talking but you couldn't hear to this
[02:25:48] day they don't know what she said but
[02:25:50] wasn't buzzing so anyway but we had a
[02:25:52] good time I it's comedic timing and
[02:25:54] that's the reason why to have a debate a
[02:25:55] debate in front of a large audience and
[02:25:57] then they prob Smith dinner I got very
[02:25:59] good reviews on that great that was
[02:26:01] great it was very funny very funny stuff
[02:26:03] the Tim wall stuff was very funny Tim
[02:26:05] wall yeah he's funny that's a real be
[02:26:07] that's a crazy one she the she said that
[02:26:09] she had picked him and this one of the
[02:26:11] question I want to ask her when she was
[02:26:12] sleep deprived she said she was uh
[02:26:14] suffering from sleep deprivation when
[02:26:16] she picked him which is just I was he
[02:26:18] maybe take a nap so I
[02:26:20] okay look let's see how it all turns out
[02:26:22] I think we're going to win I think we're
[02:26:23] way ahead now I think we're way ahead
[02:26:25] but but um can I bring you back to they
[02:26:28] lose I I think they're going to look at
[02:26:31] two things they're going to say they
[02:26:33] should have had a primary even if it was
[02:26:34] a short primary they shouldn't have
[02:26:36] picked her and then she's going to say I
[02:26:37] shouldn't have picked this guy she
[02:26:38] shouldn't have picked that guy that guy
[02:26:41] the the lying about tanan Square
[02:26:43] admitted that yeah the military record
[02:26:45] assisant coach versus head coach little
[02:26:48] thing so I did McDonald's last week
[02:26:50] I saw that and I actually got a call
[02:26:52] from your friends at Google from Sundar
[02:26:54] that's pretty good right he said this is
[02:26:56] the biggest thing we've had in years you
[02:27:00] McDonald's McDonald's did you know that
[02:27:02] it was one of the it was funny who's a
[02:27:04] great guy by the way but he said this
[02:27:07] McDonald's thing I want to tell you it's
[02:27:08] one of the biggest things we've ever had
[02:27:10] on Google it just hit but the reason I
[02:27:13] did and I actually you know you never
[02:27:15] know about this stuff I thought it was a
[02:27:16] throwaway M I didn't think our
[02:27:18] conversation is a throwaway but I
[02:27:19] thought that was I thought I'd walk in
[02:27:21] and that was only to highlight the fact
[02:27:23] and I I have a friend he owns like 56 of
[02:27:25] these McDonald's and he said you want to
[02:27:28] use one I said yeah I love it so we went
[02:27:30] there and the crowd was crazy you know
[02:27:31] they had 28,000 people s around the
[02:27:34] whole thing did you see the outside it
[02:27:35] was crazy the cars couldn't get through
[02:27:38] Secret Service was not exactly thrilled
[02:27:40] we had no idea what the hell but I went
[02:27:42] into the place and I did the French FY
[02:27:44] thing and it just hit but that's like in
[02:27:48] life sometimes you do I thought it was
[02:27:50] like a quick throw we're going to be
[02:27:51] there for 15 minutes then I said I've
[02:27:53] worked here for 15 minutes which is 15
[02:27:55] minutes more than she worked here she
[02:27:58] lied about McDonald's and you
[02:28:01] know proven that she never she well
[02:28:04] McDonald's has no information no she has
[02:28:07] no information she there's nobody the
[02:28:09] manager said she never worked there you
[02:28:11] know it was a certain place and he said
[02:28:12] they never no she lied she's a liar you
[02:28:15] know what they do they'll say like on
[02:28:18] any one of the questions take any
[02:28:20] they'll say it's the exact opposite of
[02:28:23] what I say IVF he's against IVF the
[02:28:27] fertilization right he's and and it's
[02:28:29] the exact opposite I was I came out
[02:28:31] immediately strongly in favor and they
[02:28:34] do ads I'm against it it's wrong uh on
[02:28:37] every single topic and you know she
[02:28:40] changed policies on 15 I've never seen a
[02:28:43] guy change anybody change on more than
[02:28:45] one you know you can maybe get away with
[02:28:48] one her whole life fr in every single
[02:28:51] thing that she was for uh the
[02:28:53] confiscation of gun she wants to conf
[02:28:56] now she's saying everybody should have a
[02:28:57] gun in fact we're going to get her a
[02:28:58] magga cap I'm going to send her a magga
[02:29:00] cap but she's changed and I don't think
[02:29:03] people are buying it I don't think
[02:29:05] people are buying it well some people
[02:29:06] are buying it because they want to buy
[02:29:08] it because it's blue no matter who
[02:29:10] there's there's a certain percentage of
[02:29:11] our population that's going to vote
[02:29:12] Democrat no matter what that's true
[02:29:14] they're pressured there's their their
[02:29:16] Community their ideology it's as good
[02:29:19] right is I don't understand why okay you
[02:29:22] have a wall or you have a you know I
[02:29:24] built 570 mil of wall everyone say I
[02:29:27] built a lot of wall exactly the stuff
[02:29:31] but you have a border what I don't
[02:29:34] understand is who would want people to
[02:29:36] come into our country from places
[02:29:39] unknown like sometimes they'll say about
[02:29:40] a fighter from Parts Unknown right
[02:29:43] remember Hast from Parts he say from
[02:29:46] parts and the old days those are the old
[02:29:48] days that's even before you but
[02:29:51] uh who would want people to come
[02:29:53] in pouring into our country we don't
[02:29:57] know anything about but that's I want to
[02:29:58] ask you this why do you think they're
[02:30:00] doing that I think because do you think
[02:30:02] they're trying to buy votes do you think
[02:30:03] they just want cheap labor like what is
[02:30:06] what's the idea there's a couple of
[02:30:07] theories they hate our country they're
[02:30:10] stupid or they want to buy votes it's
[02:30:12] one of those three things yeah they want
[02:30:14] now they are trying to get people
[02:30:16] registered who you know don't even know
[02:30:17] what the country is and they're trying
[02:30:18] to give people amnesty people that live
[02:30:20] here they're try
[02:30:22] toenship and they
[02:30:24] want you think about the amount of money
[02:30:26] that they've given them when they've
[02:30:27] come here the food stamps the benefits
[02:30:29] that even our poor people aren't getting
[02:30:31] $200 billion and and that's a way low
[02:30:34] number that's a way low you know it's
[02:30:36] it's interesting New York has always
[02:30:37] been like uh you know sort of like
[02:30:40] always looking for money they've spent a
[02:30:42] hundred billion do on this stuff I I
[02:30:45] don't know where they and they're not
[02:30:46] getting the money from the federal
[02:30:47] government it's crazy and because the
[02:30:50] mayor came out and said we can't live
[02:30:54] like this they investigated him he gets
[02:30:57] I by the way I called it I said he just
[02:30:59] got himself indicted this group is
[02:31:03] stupid but they're vicious they're
[02:31:04] stupid people but they're vicious people
[02:31:07] the 2020 elections you say you have all
[02:31:09] this evidence that it was rigged why
[02:31:12] haven't you put this evidence in a
[02:31:14] consumable form and what did oh I did I
[02:31:17] have I have books on it and and by the
[02:31:19] way books have been written on
[02:31:22] it we have an author named Hemingway who
[02:31:25] is a great writer she wrote a book on it
[02:31:28] but many books have been written on it
[02:31:30] there are books that
[02:31:32] are what's happened is judges don't want
[02:31:35] to touch it they would say you don't
[02:31:37] have standing they didn't rule on the
[02:31:39] merits they ruled the merits never got
[02:31:41] there the judges didn't have what it
[02:31:46] took to turn over an election let's talk
[02:31:49] about the potential vulnerabilities for
[02:31:51] elections and election fraud one of them
[02:31:53] is mail in ballots the other one is
[02:31:57] the if someone can break into voting
[02:31:59] machines if someone can hack voting
[02:32:01] machines those are two huge
[02:32:04] ones Elon Musk I think he said it
[02:32:07] publicly I hope he did because I
[02:32:09] wouldn't want to be the one but he's a
[02:32:10] really smart guy and he's a very good
[02:32:14] guy with computers right you'd say he's
[02:32:15] he's one of the smartest people Al alive
[02:32:17] anybody that can land that 20 story
[02:32:19] building
[02:32:20] and perfect and while he's doing
[02:32:22] starlink while he's talk while he owns
[02:32:24] Twitter and then he agrees to starlink
[02:32:26] and he tweets 100 times a day he's an
[02:32:29] amazing guy right he said to me that
[02:32:32] unless you have paper ballots it can
[02:32:35] never be an honest election that's a big
[02:32:37] statement it's a big statement we should
[02:32:38] go to paper ballots you know France did
[02:32:41] they went the mail in voting and it was
[02:32:43] all messed up you know the amazing thing
[02:32:46] with the machines so we have the
[02:32:47] machines they cost 10 times paper ballot
[02:32:50] would cost 8% and they make paper
[02:32:53] ballots they all watermarked and
[02:32:54] everything else very sophisticated but
[02:32:57] if you take a look paper ballots 8% the
[02:33:01] cost and you're done by 9:00 in the
[02:33:03] evening right now we have the
[02:33:06] sophisticated machine it goes up to
[02:33:08] heaven it goes all over the place and
[02:33:09] down and around and they say we'll need
[02:33:12] two weeks to figure out who the hell won
[02:33:13] the election do you think that's by
[02:33:15] Design yeah I do I think it's I think
[02:33:17] it's very crooked that's my opinion
[02:33:19] you're allowed to have it opinion what
[02:33:20] could let's say you win in November what
[02:33:24] can be done to mitigate these problems
[02:33:27] what could be done at a you know at the
[02:33:29] level that the president has power well
[02:33:31] if I win that'll be this will be my last
[02:33:34] election but I think I owe it to the
[02:33:36] country yeah but I think I owe it to the
[02:33:39] country we have to have Fair elections
[02:33:41] so how can you fix that you know Jimmy
[02:33:42] Carter was the in charge of a commission
[02:33:44] you know that many years ago and they
[02:33:47] put him in scoop Jackson and very
[02:33:50] Senators you know distinguished people
[02:33:51] that were retired and they came up with
[02:33:54] a report and the report's primary
[02:33:56] finding was you cannot have mailin
[02:33:59] ballots because if it's a mailin ballot
[02:34:02] you know I went to the voting booth the
[02:34:04] last time whatever it was and I walked
[02:34:07] in in Palm Beach and I walk in and they
[02:34:09] know me they say Mr President could I
[02:34:12] see your identific bom here's this
[02:34:14] here's that everything and then you sit
[02:34:17] and you they watch you sign and you
[02:34:19] really there's not a lot you can do I
[02:34:21] mean if you want it to be dishonest it's
[02:34:23] sort of beautiful right if instead of
[02:34:25] that I'm going to send them a ballot
[02:34:28] right it has to go through the Postal
[02:34:30] Services it has to go through a lot of
[02:34:32] people they mail you houses that you
[02:34:35] know the house was demolished and the
[02:34:37] people have left and it it's so bad the
[02:34:40] one thing with Jimmy Carter he had a
[02:34:42] very strong commission who no mail and
[02:34:46] bels and we're the only one that does
[02:34:49] elections this way anymore they've
[02:34:50] gotten away from them and this is a it
[02:34:52] ticked up in a big way after Co it used
[02:34:54] to be like soldiers serving overseas
[02:34:56] they used to cheat yeah well they used
[02:34:58] Co to certainly push this mail and
[02:34:59] ballot another thing but that's but they
[02:35:02] used Co to cheat but here's another and
[02:35:04] the last election was a little bit of a
[02:35:07] you couldn't even get security guys big
[02:35:09] strong guys to watch you know what you'd
[02:35:12] call them they'd call them and this they
[02:35:14] were afraid to go out you know we had we
[02:35:15] were in the middle of
[02:35:17] Co we were in the middle of Co it right
[02:35:20] smack in the middle and they didn't want
[02:35:22] to die you know they didn't want to
[02:35:23] catch it it was like in a way it was we
[02:35:27] it was like a ghost
[02:35:29] town and the whole thing but mail and
[02:35:32] ballots are bad thing bad thing that
[02:35:34] that certainly is is a problem Ma mail
[02:35:36] and ballots are problem problem vo ID a
[02:35:40] voter ID voter ID is the most bizarre
[02:35:42] argument that I've never seen anybody
[02:35:44] articulate in a way that's convincing
[02:35:47] why don't need voter well it doesn't
[02:35:49] make makes sense any other way I've
[02:35:51] tried to strawman it or I've tried to
[02:35:53] Steelman it rather I've tried to like
[02:35:54] look at it from a position like why
[02:35:56] would you not want people to have ID and
[02:35:59] a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous
[02:36:02] the you need an ID to get a driver's
[02:36:04] license okay but here's now the next
[02:36:05] step Gavin nsam one of the worst
[02:36:08] governors in the
[02:36:09] world and I used to frankly I used to
[02:36:11] get along but I don't get along with him
[02:36:13] because he's just too you know it's just
[02:36:14] a whole con job but Gavin nusum the
[02:36:18] other day signed a bill
[02:36:20] that you are not allowed to ask a person
[02:36:23] even ask them whether or not they have
[02:36:25] voter ID now what could be a Char reason
[02:36:28] why anybody they want that would be the
[02:36:30] only thing that makes sense that's
[02:36:32] taking it to the next level right now
[02:36:35] you know you have ID the Democrat
[02:36:37] National Convention when they had it the
[02:36:39] last time I saw they had a sign like a
[02:36:41] billboard on the the name of the person
[02:36:44] where they live how they live who the
[02:36:46] hell their boyfriends are every single
[02:36:49] it was and a big picture that's for
[02:36:52] there they have an ID a big ID it was
[02:36:55] hanging like you were a prisoner it they
[02:36:57] had these massive cards everything and
[02:37:00] yet when it comes to the vote in theory
[02:37:02] the most important thing we do okay when
[02:37:04] you go to a grocery store you give ID
[02:37:07] but for a vote it's supposed to be a
[02:37:09] sacred thing and it it should be a
[02:37:11] sacred thing no voter ID because they
[02:37:13] want to cheat well it doesn't make sense
[02:37:16] in any other way I've tried to look at
[02:37:18] it there's no other way there I there's
[02:37:20] no argument that anybody's presented
[02:37:22] that makes any sense why you know the
[02:37:23] funny thing Joe the Democrats the people
[02:37:26] they all think you should have it in
[02:37:27] other words you should have if you go to
[02:37:29] the people Mrs Schwarz Mrs Smith Mr Mrs
[02:37:33] Jones sure they say of course yeah
[02:37:36] Democrats they say yes it's the
[02:37:38] politicians that don't want it like
[02:37:40] Schumer and these guys they don't want
[02:37:41] it because they want to be able to cheat
[02:37:43] because you know what if they didn't
[02:37:45] have it okay who is going to vote for
[02:37:47] somebody that wants open borders who's
[02:37:49] going to vote for somebody that wants to
[02:37:51] have uh Men playing in women's sports
[02:37:54] you know I have never had one person
[02:37:57] come up to me and say president you got
[02:38:00] to do something to allow men to play in
[02:38:02] women's sports have you ever just like
[02:38:05] I've never been called by a Polster I
[02:38:06] told you my little theory on polsters
[02:38:08] okay I'm getting myself in trouble with
[02:38:10] some of these things but I don't really
[02:38:11] care nobody's ever come up to me and
[02:38:15] said we want to have men playing women's
[02:38:18] sports and you know I had I had a funny
[02:38:22] thing at a property I own in California
[02:38:25] I have a woman who's a very good athlete
[02:38:27] and she works there as a manager and
[02:38:30] Brian eracer the big uh Chicago Bear
[02:38:33] great player you know uh ttime Allstar I
[02:38:36] guess Hall of Famer a great guy big
[02:38:38] strong guy and they she said oh he's one
[02:38:41] of my favorite athletes can I have a
[02:38:43] picture and I took a picture and I sent
[02:38:45] and I noticed she was the size of his
[02:38:47] leg his leg was bigger than she was and
[02:38:49] I put it out should men play in women's
[02:38:52] sport the whole it was just so
[02:38:54] ridiculous um what's one of the most
[02:38:56] bizarre and polarizing ideas that's
[02:38:58] promoted by the left but who wants it
[02:39:00] now unless you're going to cheat in
[02:39:02] elections you're never going to get
[02:39:04] nobody wants it I don't think anybody
[02:39:05] wants it I've never I've been told
[02:39:07] everything you know you can some people
[02:39:09] want
[02:39:10] this I don't know if anybody that wants
[02:39:12] open borders nobody's ever come up to me
[02:39:14] and say president you got to let the
[02:39:16] world come into our country right now if
[02:39:18] they won so they have 21 million I think
[02:39:21] it's much higher than that because you
[02:39:22] have Goda aways you know Goda aways
[02:39:23] where they just walk in they walk in by
[02:39:25] and the other thing you have is human
[02:39:27] traffickers you have traffickers and
[02:39:28] they traffic in women and they're going
[02:39:31] wild now we used to you know you have to
[02:39:34] look the trunk of cars can you believe
[02:39:35] it they put women in trunks they'll put
[02:39:37] three women in a trunk these people are
[02:39:40] savages they're horrible the worst
[02:39:41] people the you and they're making the
[02:39:44] kind of money they make on drugs they're
[02:39:45] almost making on trafficking now and the
[02:39:48] thing that's made it hot is the internet
[02:39:50] that's what you know you think of it
[02:39:52] almost as an ancient thing but it's the
[02:39:55] internet but who would want to have
[02:39:57] these things who would want to have
[02:39:58] there's so many the transgender
[02:40:00] operations where they're allowed to take
[02:40:02] your child when he goes to school and
[02:40:05] turn him into a male to a female without
[02:40:09] parental consent who wants this does
[02:40:12] anybody want this I've never heard of
[02:40:13] anyone and I can go into 10 different
[02:40:15] things the only way they get them is by
[02:40:20] no voter ID you can't have voter ID they
[02:40:22] don't want any they want to cheat
[02:40:25] there's only one reason cuz the voter ID
[02:40:28] is so basic it's the most basic thing
[02:40:30] it's very basic who would want this they
[02:40:33] want it so they can cheat because their
[02:40:35] policies are no good their Pol I'll tell
[02:40:38] you they're very smart when it comes to
[02:40:40] that they're very smart although they're
[02:40:43] not smart in terms of uh politics in a
[02:40:45] way because what do they have that
[02:40:47] people want they really don't have they
[02:40:49] give away a lot of Health Care a lot of
[02:40:51] stuff but for the most part their
[02:40:53] policies are terrible their policy on
[02:40:55] Military she's running on a tax she's
[02:40:57] going to raise your taxes you got to
[02:40:59] hear this we are going to raise your
[02:41:01] taxes and the people clap but who is
[02:41:04] going to win with her all my life I grew
[02:41:07] up with politicians lower
[02:41:10] taxes she's she's politi in that we are
[02:41:13] going to raise your taxes well they want
[02:41:15] to raise the idea is you want to raise
[02:41:17] the taxes to the highest earners I know
[02:41:19] but they think Millionaires and
[02:41:21] billionaires are not paying their Fair
[02:41:22] shares it doesn't work that way well
[02:41:23] it's a narrative right and it's a
[02:41:25] narrative that appeals to people that
[02:41:26] are not doing well and like yeah our
[02:41:29] problems are that these rich people are
[02:41:30] not paying taxes well the problems are
[02:41:32] the rich people are going to leave and
[02:41:33] they're going to close up their
[02:41:34] companies and then the other people
[02:41:36] aren't going to have jobs you know
[02:41:37] that's what happens it does happen in
[02:41:39] other countries but the the whole
[02:41:40] because you you brought it up I'll tell
[02:41:42] you what we just uh uh he's doing a very
[02:41:45] good job in Virginia Glenn yunan I don't
[02:41:47] know if you like him not like him I
[02:41:49] don't know but they oh you don't I'm the
[02:41:50] governor of Virginia so we have a case
[02:41:54] where they found thousands of illegal
[02:41:57] ballots a judge just rulle that they
[02:41:59] have to be able to vote just happened
[02:42:02] today just before I walked in here I
[02:42:03] heard uh a judge just ruled that you
[02:42:07] have to keep those people in they're
[02:42:09] illegal they're illegal votes now I
[02:42:12] think they'll be overturned at the next
[02:42:13] court one thing I found because I had a
[02:42:15] couple of things that they got
[02:42:16] overturned a little bit you know the
[02:42:18] system because the system
[02:42:20] you have to hope that the appella judges
[02:42:23] are honest otherwise we don't have a
[02:42:26] country anymore it's very important but
[02:42:28] the whole thing with the legal ballots
[02:42:30] has got to be looked at you got to have
[02:42:32] you have to have voter ID and you have
[02:42:34] to have additional ID you have to have
[02:42:36] an ID that shows that you're a citizen
[02:42:37] of the country I agree they don't want
[02:42:39] that either I agree um one of the things
[02:42:42] that I want to talk to you about is the
[02:42:44] JFK files and one of the things that you
[02:42:46] said was that if they showed you what
[02:42:49] they showed me this was your quote you
[02:42:51] wouldn't want people to know it
[02:42:53] either um
[02:42:56] so I I opened them up
[02:43:01] partially I was met with from good
[02:43:03] people I mean you know look at me good
[02:43:05] people people that were well-meaning
[02:43:07] Mike Pompeo was one of them he's a good
[02:43:11] person uh they called me they said sir
[02:43:14] would rather have you not after and I
[02:43:18] did open them
[02:43:20] but I was asked by some people not to
[02:43:22] open them there's a Martin Luther King
[02:43:24] file too by the way that they'd like to
[02:43:26] see I don't know if you know but there
[02:43:27] is that but but JFK in particular so
[02:43:32] they call me a lot of good people call
[02:43:34] me people that I you know that you would
[02:43:36] find reasonable people and they asked me
[02:43:38] not to do it so I said well we'll close
[02:43:40] it for another time but if I win I'm
[02:43:43] going to open them up I'm just going to
[02:43:45] open enough times why didn't you open it
[02:43:46] up the first time though what was the
[02:43:48] hesitation though addresses people that
[02:43:50] are still living there are people that
[02:43:52] are affected um and there could be some
[02:43:56] National Security reason that for you
[02:43:57] know that I don't have to necessarily
[02:43:59] know about but some very good talented
[02:44:01] people asked me not to do it I opened it
[02:44:04] up and then they said would it be
[02:44:06] possible for us to do that a different
[02:44:09] day what how much of it did you read
[02:44:11] into uh
[02:44:14] uh I think it's going to be just fine to
[02:44:17] open it let me put it that way I think
[02:44:18] it's fine it's going to be time it's a
[02:44:20] cleansing you know it's really a
[02:44:21] cleansing so I'm going to do it I'm
[02:44:23] going to do it immediately almost
[02:44:25] immediately upon entering office well
[02:44:27] the thing when people look at it from
[02:44:28] the outside and you sort of imagine what
[02:44:32] could be a reason why they would not
[02:44:34] release those files it would be there's
[02:44:38] people that were implicated
[02:44:40] assassination yeah well when there
[02:44:43] living people you generally tend not to
[02:44:44] want to do it when people are still
[02:44:46] living living people that formerly work
[02:44:49] for the government for the government
[02:44:50] and living people that were somehow
[02:44:52] involved in it and you tend not to do
[02:44:54] that but it's time to open them um I
[02:44:58] can't tell you whether or not uh they're
[02:45:00] going to find anything of interest and I
[02:45:02] did partially open I think I I've opened
[02:45:05] 50% but I was asked not to do it and I I
[02:45:09] I thought that was a reasonable ask but
[02:45:10] now I'm going to do it I'm going to do
[02:45:11] it very soon there's a lot of interest
[02:45:13] in it one of the things that there's a
[02:45:15] lot of interest in uh the uh people
[02:45:17] coming from space you know yes and I
[02:45:19] know you're interested in oh I'm very
[02:45:21] interested in that how much did they
[02:45:22] tell you about that a lot really yeah
[02:45:24] what' they tell you how much can you
[02:45:26] tell so I how's that work is it like
[02:45:28] super top secret tell you know well
[02:45:31] based on Hunter Biden I can say whatever
[02:45:32] the hell I want right but no but I
[02:45:35] interviewed a few people it's never been
[02:45:37] my thing I have to be honest I I have
[02:45:39] never been a Believer I have people that
[02:45:41] area 51 or whatever it is I think it's
[02:45:43] the number one tourist attraction in the
[02:45:45] whole country or something Area 51 at
[02:45:47] Las V do you know that right sure I know
[02:45:49] what it is so anyway but it's a big
[02:45:51] tourist thing so I interviewed jet
[02:45:56] Pilots that say they saw something if
[02:46:00] you saw them you'd love to have them as
[02:46:01] I've had a couple in here Commander
[02:46:03] David fraver yeah I had him in who had
[02:46:06] that sighting in 2004 very very
[02:46:08] compelling with visual video evidence
[02:46:10] radar evidence I Brian Graves I don't
[02:46:13] believe his name but I I interviewed jet
[02:46:16] Pilots that uh were solid people the
[02:46:21] perfect I mean great Pilots great
[02:46:23] everything and they said we saw things
[02:46:25] sir that were were very strange like a
[02:46:30] round ball but it wasn't a comet or a
[02:46:32] meteor it was something and it was going
[02:46:35] four times faster than an F22 which is a
[02:46:38] very fast plan you
[02:46:39] know and it was round um which isn't in
[02:46:43] theory a great shape so when you were
[02:46:46] talking to these people was was this
[02:46:48] something thing that you were compelled
[02:46:50] to have conversations about was this
[02:46:52] your personal interest a little bit it
[02:46:54] it's not a great interest for me but
[02:46:56] it's a little interest I get that
[02:46:58] question as much as almost any question
[02:47:00] do you think that we have aliens coming
[02:47:02] you know flying around or whatever what
[02:47:04] do you
[02:47:06] think there's no reason not to I mean
[02:47:08] there's no reason not to think that Mars
[02:47:10] and all these planets don't have life
[02:47:13] you know because well Mars we've had
[02:47:14] probes there and Rovers and I don't
[02:47:16] think there's any life there well maybe
[02:47:18] it's life that we don't know but maybe
[02:47:19] well maybe there was life there at one
[02:47:21] point in time this is the speculation
[02:47:22] about Mars that Mars had a an atmosphere
[02:47:26] at one point in time a long time ago
[02:47:27] that could support life it ALS also had
[02:47:29] large bodies of water but we've had no
[02:47:31] evidence of even bacterial life that
[02:47:33] exists on Mars but the univ not been a
[02:47:36] big thing for me I mean when I looked at
[02:47:38] what China did to this ad they would
[02:47:40] have never done it with me where they
[02:47:41] put the balloon up and a lot of people
[02:47:43] thought and a lot of people thought for
[02:47:44] a little while that that was one of
[02:47:46] these things well that's a lot of the
[02:47:48] speculation too that some of these
[02:47:49] drones that hover over battleships that
[02:47:51] these are Chinese drones and that
[02:47:53] they're not UFOs they could be also
[02:47:54] there's some super sophisticated I did
[02:47:56] interview a let's say three or four guys
[02:47:59] that and without tremendous interest if
[02:48:03] you had
[02:48:04] them as I said you'd love to have me as
[02:48:07] your children solid beautiful people
[02:48:11] they said sir there's something there
[02:48:13] you know they' there's something they
[02:48:15] said it yeah yeah I've talked to quite a
[02:48:17] few of them they're not conspiracy guys
[02:48:19] well I mean the just the commander David
[02:48:20] fraver thing in 2004 off the coast of
[02:48:23] San Diego they clocked that thing going
[02:48:24] from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50
[02:48:27] in a second yeah they don't know what it
[02:48:29] is that's tough to beat yeah they they
[02:48:31] saw something in the water it was
[02:48:33] hovering over that something that was
[02:48:34] making a disturbance in the water they
[02:48:36] got video evidence of this thing two
[02:48:39] different fighter jets with pilots in
[02:48:41] them saw it there's you know Visual
[02:48:43] Evidence photographic evidence video
[02:48:45] evidence radar evidence whatever the
[02:48:47] hell it is it moves in a way that would
[02:48:49] turn a human being into Jello if they
[02:48:51] inside of it the GeForce no one would
[02:48:52] survive like what is that and we don't
[02:48:55] they it doesn't have a heat signature
[02:48:57] they don't know what their propulsion
[02:48:58] system was but when you fly in some of
[02:49:01] these
[02:49:02] jets these Pilots have to be in great
[02:49:05] shape oh yeah I flew with the Blue
[02:49:07] Angels once yeah I got the fly I guess
[02:49:10] and those are older machines and they're
[02:49:12] crazy when you when you fly in
[02:49:14] somebody's things amazing yeah but you
[02:49:16] got to be special but these things these
[02:49:19] people are en counting are far superior
[02:49:20] to what we know of yeah do is it
[02:49:23] possible that there's some military or
[02:49:26] government program that you weren't that
[02:49:29] they didn't tell you
[02:49:30] about I I think I had a great
[02:49:32] relationship with the military basically
[02:49:35] but you know I didn't like certain
[02:49:36] people I would have gotten them out if I
[02:49:38] thought if I were if the election was
[02:49:40] different I would have fired you know
[02:49:43] all of them quickly some most of them I
[02:49:45] did fire uh Biden should have fired
[02:49:47] every military person involved with
[02:49:50] Afghanistan he should have had a lot of
[02:49:52] firings you know if you look at him he
[02:49:54] told Israel not to do anything and at
[02:49:56] least Israel's not going to looking at a
[02:49:57] bomb the way they would have been think
[02:49:59] if they listen to Biden they'd be
[02:50:01] waiting for a bomb to drop on their head
[02:50:03] right
[02:50:04] now he's been wrong about so much I
[02:50:06] guess you'd have to say that she's been
[02:50:08] wrong too because you know they she
[02:50:09] always said they made the decision
[02:50:11] together but uh Israel didn't follow his
[02:50:15] advice and I think it was a very uh you
[02:50:19] know there it's a very the Middle East
[02:50:20] is rapidly changing you know there are
[02:50:23] prophets that say the world will come to
[02:50:25] an end in the Middle East you know that
[02:50:28] right and we have weapons today that are
[02:50:32] so scary when you look I rebuilt them
[02:50:34] all and when you look at the weapons we
[02:50:37] have today the biggest threat we have in
[02:50:39] the world today is nuclear weapons and
[02:50:42] we have other weapons too that are
[02:50:43] devastating but the nuclear weapons the
[02:50:46] biggest threat we have in the world
[02:50:47] today and that's what
[02:50:49] you I was talking about deescalation
[02:50:52] with both China and Russia I'm telling
[02:50:55] you we were going to deescalate they
[02:50:58] were going to deescalate you got to be
[02:50:59] careful we it's a little tricky playing
[02:51:01] with them because they say we're going
[02:51:03] to do it and they don't do it maybe but
[02:51:05] they understood the curse too it's a
[02:51:07] curse it's uh China's way behind us but
[02:51:10] they'll catch us within five years so
[02:51:12] let's imagine let's let's say you win in
[02:51:14] November what do you do differently and
[02:51:17] how do you change this course that it
[02:51:19] seems we are on for World War II how do
[02:51:22] you get us out of Ukraine how do you
[02:51:24] stop what's going on in the Middle East
[02:51:26] how do you put a stop to this well it's
[02:51:28] it's a very uh to me it's an easy
[02:51:31] question because I think I can do it
[02:51:32] easily but it's a complex question in
[02:51:34] the sense that the times change every
[02:51:37] day
[02:51:38] changes uh who's winning who's not
[02:51:40] winning I mean Russia is a war machine
[02:51:44] whether you like it or not it Just
[02:51:46] grinds along grinds along you speak to
[02:51:48] people like Victor Oran he'll tell you
[02:51:51] it's a just a big fat War Machine and
[02:51:54] that's what's happening you look at
[02:51:55] what's happened to
[02:51:57] Ukraine if I were there it would have
[02:51:59] never happened but what you what could
[02:52:01] you do now if you get into office in
[02:52:03] January what could you do right now uh
[02:52:06] you would get both of them I know both
[02:52:08] very well and and again I I I cannot I
[02:52:11] do not want to tell you you know for the
[02:52:13] purpose of looking smart to fight people
[02:52:16] that you know that say oh he was great
[02:52:18] because because if I told you exactly
[02:52:20] what I do I could I could never make the
[02:52:23] deal all I can tell you is that I would
[02:52:25] meet with Putin and I would meet with
[02:52:26] him and I know exactly what I'd say to
[02:52:28] each one of them and I believe that as
[02:52:31] president-elect I would get that war
[02:52:33] stopped and stopped fast you know we
[02:52:36] have tremendous power in the United
[02:52:38] States if you know how to use the power
[02:52:40] I stopped other Wars just by the use of
[02:52:42] tariffs I got macron of France good gu
[02:52:47] like a friend of mine but a wise guy and
[02:52:50] he's a person that likes France and he
[02:52:52] was going to tax our companies I say you
[02:52:54] and I sent all the smartest guys I sent
[02:52:56] manuch and they all failed me and I said
[02:52:59] I'll do it myself and I called him I
[02:53:01] said Emanuel you're taxing American
[02:53:04] companies we're not going to allow you
[02:53:05] to do that oh Donald I cannot do nothing
[02:53:07] I could do it's already been passed I
[02:53:09] said Emanuel if you do that I'm going to
[02:53:13] put a 100% tariff when your wines and
[02:53:15] Champagnes are coming to the United
[02:53:17] States and you're going to regret that
[02:53:19] you ever did it he said Don please
[02:53:21] that's not fair anyway within about two
[02:53:23] minutes he dropped the whole thing it
[02:53:25] was massive amounts of money against
[02:53:27] American companies I have to protect
[02:53:29] American companies so why doesn't the
[02:53:31] bid Administration do this because
[02:53:32] they're incompetent they don't know how
[02:53:34] to talk look they met in
[02:53:36] Alaska with uh the Chinese and the
[02:53:40] Chinese lectured them about how badly we
[02:53:44] treat people right okay I mean think of
[02:53:48] it
[02:53:49] you remember that it was like in they
[02:53:50] didn't talk to me that way they never
[02:53:53] they respected me they respected our
[02:53:55] country they don't respect our country
[02:53:57] they don't respect Biden they don't
[02:53:59] respect her they're dreaming about her
[02:54:03] because she's incompetent she's not a
[02:54:05] smart person look she can't put two
[02:54:07] sentences together she talks I watched
[02:54:10] her two nights I watched her last night
[02:54:12] too was the same thing she's not a smart
[02:54:15] person these guys are very smart and
[02:54:17] they're very Street wise and they're
[02:54:19] very tricky and evil and
[02:54:21] dangerous and if she
[02:54:24] becomes the president of the United
[02:54:26] States which I can't believe can happen
[02:54:28] uh I don't think this country is going
[02:54:30] to make it I I don't think we'll ever
[02:54:33] be I think I think bad just really bad
[02:54:36] things will happen to our country and
[02:54:37] you know what I look at the outside
[02:54:39] forces and I say they can all be handled
[02:54:42] because we have a pot of gold but we're
[02:54:44] not going to have that pot of gold to
[02:54:45] play with anymore you know it's a great
[02:54:47] negotiating thing
[02:54:48] I told you I I knocked out this massive
[02:54:51] car company going to take all of our car
[02:54:53] business from Detroit I knocked it out
[02:54:56] just by my rhetoric rhetorically I
[02:54:59] said they'll never sell a car in here
[02:55:01] I'll put tariffs I don't care they're
[02:55:03] 2,000% they're never going to build that
[02:55:05] plant and is it possible to apply that
[02:55:07] same thing to the electronics that we
[02:55:09] use one of the things that disturbs me
[02:55:11] greatly is that all of our phones are
[02:55:13] made overseas and then some of our
[02:55:15] phones are made in places like yes and
[02:55:17] the chips and some of our phones are
[02:55:18] made in places like foxcon where they
[02:55:20] have Nets around the building to keep
[02:55:21] people from jumping off the roof because
[02:55:23] they have so many suicides like wouldn't
[02:55:25] it be better to have an americanmade
[02:55:27] iPhone where you know people are paid
[02:55:28] good wages they have health insurance
[02:55:30] they're taken care of they can live a
[02:55:32] good life where you're not buying a
[02:55:34] piece of electronics that's cheaper
[02:55:36] because someone has to suffer a horrible
[02:55:39] in a horrible way that's not even legal
[02:55:40] in the United States it's not even legal
[02:55:42] to have them work that way in the United
[02:55:44] States so they get these people to build
[02:55:45] them overseas you do it but but let me
[02:55:47] just say
[02:55:49] that chip deal is so bad we put up
[02:55:51] billions of dollars for Rich companies
[02:55:53] to come in and borrow the money and
[02:55:55] build chip companies here and they're
[02:55:57] not going to give us the good companies
[02:55:59] anyway all you had to do is charge them
[02:56:01] tariffs if you were to put a tariff on
[02:56:04] the chips coming in you would have been
[02:56:06] able to just like the auto companies no
[02:56:08] different more sophisticated but no
[02:56:11] different you know Taiwan they stole our
[02:56:14] chip
[02:56:15] business okay they want us to protect
[02:56:18] and want protection they don't pay us
[02:56:19] money for the protection you know the
[02:56:21] mob makes you pay money right but with
[02:56:24] these countries that we protect I got
[02:56:27] hundreds of billions of dollars from
[02:56:29] NATO countries that were never paying us
[02:56:32] and my biggest fan is stoltenberg who
[02:56:33] just left as the you know director
[02:56:36] General as the Secretary General good
[02:56:39] guy he said Bush came he made a speech
[02:56:42] Obama came he made a speech Trump came
[02:56:44] he said you guys aren't paying you got
[02:56:45] to pay and they said will you protect us
[02:56:48] from Russia if we don't I said no you
[02:56:50] got to pay if you don't pay billions of
[02:56:52] dollars came in to
[02:56:55] Nato when I see us paying a lot of money
[02:56:57] to have people build chip that's not the
[02:57:00] way you didn't have to put up 10 cents
[02:57:02] you could have done it with a series of
[02:57:03] tariffs in other words you tariff it's
[02:57:05] so high that they will come and build
[02:57:09] their chip companies for nothing in
[02:57:11] other words Joe you put a big tariff on
[02:57:14] the chips coming in I say you don't have
[02:57:16] to pay the Tariff all you have to do was
[02:57:18] build your plant in the United States we
[02:57:20] didn't have to give them the money to
[02:57:22] build the plant besides that they're
[02:57:24] very rich companies these chip companies
[02:57:26] they stole they stole
[02:57:28] 95% of our business it's in Taiwan right
[02:57:31] now they do a great job but that's only
[02:57:34] because we have stupid politicians we
[02:57:35] lost the chip business and now we think
[02:57:38] we're going to pay you can't build it
[02:57:40] that way you have to make them spend
[02:57:43] their money in the United States and
[02:57:44] those plants would open up all over and
[02:57:46] they'll fund them we don't have to put
[02:57:47] up 10 cents
[02:57:48] and I am in the process of making a huge
[02:57:51] speech in about a little while and you
