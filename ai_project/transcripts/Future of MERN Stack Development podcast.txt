[00:00:00] [Music]
[00:00:12] all right so today we're really diving
[00:00:14] into the M Stack and figuring out if
[00:00:17] it's got staying power you know if it's
[00:00:19] really the future of web apps or just
[00:00:21] another one of those trendy things
[00:00:22] that'll be gone in a minute yeah well
[00:00:24] and that's what's so fascinating about
[00:00:25] it right I mean it's not just some
[00:00:27] random framework that popped up right
[00:00:29] it's like a fundamental shift in how
[00:00:31] we're building for the web okay so for
[00:00:33] anyone who's not a coder who doesn't
[00:00:34] speak M fluently break it down for us
[00:00:37] what exactly is the M Stack okay so
[00:00:40] imagine you're putting together like a
[00:00:42] team okay your All-Star lineup I like it
[00:00:45] each player with their own superpower
[00:00:47] that's M okay you've got mongod DB which
[00:00:50] is like your data Guru keeps everything
[00:00:52] organized and flowing right then there's
[00:00:54] express.js which is like the behind the-
[00:00:57] scenes manager making sure everything on
[00:00:59] the back and runs without a hitch so
[00:01:01] it's like the engine of the car you
[00:01:03] don't see it but it's got to work
[00:01:05] exactly and then front and center you've
[00:01:07] got react.js okay that's your user
[00:01:09] interface withered creating those smooth
[00:01:11] seamless experiences we all love so
[00:01:13] those single page apps where it just
[00:01:15] updates without like refreshing the
[00:01:17] whole page that's react doing its thing
[00:01:19] that's it making everything Dynamic and
[00:01:21] engaging okay I'm starting to see how
[00:01:23] the pieces fit together but we're
[00:01:24] missing
[00:01:25] one what about node.js uh node.js this
[00:01:29] is where things things get really
[00:01:30] interesting because you see
[00:01:33] traditionally JavaScript was kind of
[00:01:35] stuck you know like confined to one area
[00:01:38] exactly it could only work on the front
[00:01:40] end the part of the website you actually
[00:01:41] see okay but no JS comes along and it's
[00:01:44] like nope javascript's going backstage
[00:01:46] too now you can use it on the server
[00:01:48] side as well so instead of needing like
[00:01:51] different languages for the front and
[00:01:52] back end MN lets you use JavaScript for
[00:01:55] everything exactly streamlined efficient
[00:01:58] elegant and efficient in the world of
[00:02:00] webdev is I'm guessing very important oh
[00:02:03] absolutely less context switching for
[00:02:05] developers faster development Cycles
[00:02:08] smoother communication between teams
[00:02:09] it's huge especially for those really
[00:02:12] big complex web applications right
[00:02:15] absolutely and it's not just about
[00:02:16] efficiency this whole Dream Team
[00:02:18] approach has some really big
[00:02:19] implications for the apps we're all
[00:02:21] using every day okay I'm intrigued let's
[00:02:23] talk about those shall we Okay so we've
[00:02:26] got this dream team of Technologies all
[00:02:28] speaking the same language which is and
[00:02:30] all but what's the big deal for
[00:02:32] developers why is everyone like
[00:02:34] scrambling to add M to their resume well
[00:02:36] you hit the nail on the head there it's
[00:02:38] about more than just you know being
[00:02:40] trendy it's about what M actually lets
[00:02:43] you do first off full stack developers
[00:02:46] people who can handle both the front and
[00:02:48] back end of an application they're in
[00:02:50] super high demand right now they're
[00:02:52] talking competitive salaries the
[00:02:54] flexibility to work remotely the whole
[00:02:56] nine yards yeah it's like the golden
[00:02:58] ticket of the tech World exactly but
[00:03:00] it's not just about job security right
[00:03:02] it's about the possibilities that
[00:03:03] knowing M opens up you got it and here's
[00:03:06] the thing with M you're not stuck
[00:03:08] working with some proprietary platform
[00:03:10] or someone else's tools it's all open
[00:03:12] source okay which means it's constantly
[00:03:15] evolving constantly being improved by
[00:03:17] like a global community of developers so
[00:03:20] it's like having a massive support
[00:03:21] system of M experts all just building
[00:03:24] and refining the tools that's exactly it
[00:03:26] you're not just learning a skill you're
[00:03:28] joining a movement
[00:03:30] and this open source nature it makes M
[00:03:34] incredibly flexible incredibly powerful
[00:03:37] especially when you think about how much
[00:03:39] data is driving the modern web okay
[00:03:41] let's talk data for a second because
[00:03:42] it's everywhere these days right so how
[00:03:44] does m handle this like Deluge of
[00:03:48] information think about it the apps
[00:03:50] you're using every single day social
[00:03:52] media those shopping apps streaming
[00:03:54] services they're all crunching massive
[00:03:56] amounts of data right to personalize
[00:03:58] your experience to predict what you
[00:04:00] might want to buy or watch to constantly
[00:04:03] get better it's kind of creepy when you
[00:04:04] think about it it is but it's also
[00:04:06] incredibly powerful and M especially
[00:04:08] mongod DD is built from the ground up to
[00:04:11] handle this kind of data explosion so
[00:04:13] it's not just about building an app it's
[00:04:15] about building an app that can scale
[00:04:17] that can handle millions of users
[00:04:19] terabytes of data exactly without
[00:04:21] breaking the SWAT okay that's impressive
[00:04:23] and this scalability it's essential in a
[00:04:26] world where everything has to be faster
[00:04:29] smoother more responsive and then
[00:04:31] there's the whole user experience piece
[00:04:32] which is where react really comes in
[00:04:34] right exactly and because react is so
[00:04:36] widely used there's this whole ecosystem
[00:04:38] built around it tools Frameworks all
[00:04:41] designed to make those user interfaces
[00:04:44] super Sleek super intuitive so react is
[00:04:47] like the cool kid that everyone wants to
[00:04:48] hang out with something like that but
[00:04:51] what it means for you as a developer is
[00:04:54] that your skills are always relevant
[00:04:56] they're always evolving along with the
[00:04:57] web and things are evolving fast that's
[00:04:59] it's an understatement and honestly
[00:05:01] about to get even more interesting when
[00:05:03] we start talking about the future of M
[00:05:06] all right you've definitely piqued my
[00:05:07] curiosity let's talk about the future
[00:05:10] all right so we've covered what m is why
[00:05:12] it matters but now the million-dollar
[00:05:15] question what's next what does the
[00:05:18] future hold for this Tech and for the
[00:05:20] developers who Master it buckle up
[00:05:23] because we're heading into the world of
[00:05:25] serverless architecture ooh sounds fancy
[00:05:28] it is pretty game in imagine you're
[00:05:30] building an app right but instead of
[00:05:32] having this one big server handling
[00:05:34] everything okay you break down your
[00:05:36] app's functions into these smaller
[00:05:39] independent services so instead of
[00:05:41] managing like a whole server Farm I can
[00:05:43] just sprinkle these mini functions
[00:05:45] around the cloud it's kind of like that
[00:05:46] yeah okay with serverless you only pay
[00:05:48] for the computing power you actually use
[00:05:50] no more server headaches sounds like a
[00:05:52] dream for developers but where does m
[00:05:54] fit into all of this that's the beauty
[00:05:57] of it m is practically made for
[00:05:59] serverless
[00:06:00] really each of those independent
[00:06:02] Services we talked about you can build
[00:06:03] them with M components and then deploy
[00:06:06] them seamlessly on platforms like AWS
[00:06:08] Lambda Google Cloud functions and it's
[00:06:11] like M was Built For This Cloud native
[00:06:13] World okay that's seriously cool but we
[00:06:16] can't talk about the future without
[00:06:17] talking about AI it's everywhere these
[00:06:19] days should M developers be like
[00:06:22] brushing up on their machine learning
[00:06:24] skills or are we all about to be out of
[00:06:26] a job out of a job not a chance actually
[00:06:28] M Developers are in a really unique
[00:06:30] position to leverage AI oh really how so
[00:06:33] think about it integrating AI chat Bots
[00:06:35] directly into your M app okay creating
[00:06:37] personalized content recommendations
[00:06:39] based on user data it's all within reach
[00:06:41] so we're not being replaced by robots
[00:06:42] we're building the robots exactly M
[00:06:45] gives you that flexibility and with this
[00:06:47] whole microservices approach integrating
[00:06:49] AI components becomes a breeze okay my
[00:06:51] mind is officially blown but there's one
[00:06:53] more thing we got to talk web 3.0 it's
[00:06:55] the buzzword of the century but how does
[00:06:58] M Stack Up in this whole decentralized
[00:07:00] future web 3.0 is all about Shifting the
[00:07:03] power right moving away from those
[00:07:05] centralized platforms and giving users
[00:07:08] more control more ownership and M M's
[00:07:10] ready no way really absolutely react
[00:07:13] with its component based structure is
[00:07:14] perfect for building those modular
[00:07:16] interactive daps that are like the
[00:07:18] building blocks of web 3.0 wow and then
[00:07:21] there's mongodb its flexibility is a
[00:07:23] game Cher when it comes to handling data
[00:07:25] in this decentralized world so knowing M
[00:07:28] it's not just about building today's
[00:07:30] websites it's about shaping the future
[00:07:32] of the internet itself now you're
[00:07:35] getting it okay this is all super
[00:07:36] exciting but let's get practical if
[00:07:39] someone's listening to this totally
[00:07:40] pumped about M what are some concrete
[00:07:43] skills they should be focusing on to
[00:07:45] really ride this wave into the future
[00:07:48] well first off typescript it's a must
[00:07:51] have okay typescript got it it's like
[00:07:52] javascript's cooler older sibling helps
[00:07:55] you write cleaner code more reliable
[00:07:57] code and when your projects get bigger
[00:07:59] That's essential makes sense what else
[00:08:01] you want to dive into the world of
[00:08:02] devops get comfortable with Cloud
[00:08:04] platforms like AWS Google Cloud okay
[00:08:07] knowing how to deploy scale and manage
[00:08:09] your M apps in the cloud that's crucial
[00:08:12] so typescript Cloud skills is there
[00:08:14] anything else or is learning just a way
[00:08:15] of life in web development oh it's a
[00:08:18] NeverEnding Journey my friend and the
[00:08:20] react ecosystem it's constantly evolving
[00:08:22] new tools and Frameworks are popping up
[00:08:25] all the time so true nextjs remix you've
[00:08:28] got to keep exploring keep experimenting
[00:08:30] that's how you stay ahead of the game
[00:08:32] and I'm guessing performance
[00:08:33] optimization that never goes out of
[00:08:34] style right you know it nobody wants a
[00:08:36] slow app right mastering things like
[00:08:39] lazy loading code splitting efficient
[00:08:42] caching those are your secret weapons
[00:08:44] for creating those Lightning Fast user
[00:08:46] experiences so there you have it folks
[00:08:49] the world of M Stack development is
[00:08:52] bursting with potential it's true
[00:08:54] whether you're just starting out or
[00:08:55] you're a Season Pro there's never been a
[00:08:57] better time to dive in it's not just
[00:08:59] about about coding it's about shaping
[00:09:00] the future and with M those
[00:09:02] possibilities they're Limitless that's
[00:09:04] it for a deep dive into the exciting
[00:09:07] world of minin Stack development we hope
[00:09:08] you learned a ton maybe even feel
[00:09:10] inspired to start building the future of
[00:09:12] the web until next time
