[00:00:00] Hey, welcome back to the channel. Today, 
I want to share the resources I use to get  
[00:00:06] Getting design inspiration is always 
a struggle, but over the years,  
[00:00:09] I've collected some amazing websites that 
have helped me to build clean, professional,  
[00:00:14] and user-friendly websites. One thing that 
has really helped me to stay inspired and  
[00:00:18] get creative is to know where to look for 
inspiration. For this video, I have actually  
[00:00:23] put together a website where I've collected all 
the resources I am using to build my product.
[00:00:28] NoAwwwards.com is not on that list, and I will 
tell you why in a minute. Design isn't just about  
[00:00:33] making things pretty; it's about functionality 
and the user experience. I think there are  
[00:00:39] three contributors that developers get wrong when 
they build a website: fonts, colors, and spacing.
[00:00:46] Let me give you an example. One of my current 
favorite fonts is Gist by Varsity, it's clean,  
[00:00:52] modern, and extremely versatile, perfect for 
tech websites. Gist can act as your main font  
[00:00:58] for things like body tags, menus, and general 
information. It's easy on the eyes and keeps  
[00:01:04] things clean. But when you want to highlight 
something important, like a headline or a  
[00:01:09] call-to-action, you can bring in a bold font 
like Thunder, for example, to make people look  
[00:01:14] at it right away. This kind of pairing - simple 
and clean from Gist and bold and chunky with  
[00:01:20] Thunder - keeps your design balanced while guiding 
people to things you want them to see first.
[00:01:27] And when it comes to text on your website, 
you have to add spacing to it to give your  
[00:01:33] site enough breathing room and avoid a cluttered 
look. Designing without consideration for spacing  
[00:01:37] is like trying to write a book with 
no paragraphs; it's just hard to read.
[00:01:44] I'm not going to dive too deep into colors in 
this video, but to give you a real-life example,  
[00:01:50] I have recently built a chart component with 
different colors. My primary focus was to  
[00:01:56] make this component work first, so I used the 
brand colors for each bar. But as you can see,  
[00:02:02] it ended up looking like...well, I don't know, 
a kid's toy. But once the component was working,  
[00:02:09] I focused on the colors, and you can 
see now clearly the difference. This  
[00:02:14] updated version now looks like a 
proper product for the B2B sector.
[00:02:18] The impact color can have on your product is 
huge, but the topic of color is also too big  
[00:02:22] for this video. If you're interested in learning 
more about color, let me know in the comments.
[00:02:28] Alright, let's talk about where I get 
my inspiration from. The web is full  
[00:02:31] of amazing resources, but these are my 
favorites. Let's start with Dribbble.  
[00:02:36] Dribbble is still one of my go-to resources for 
design inspiration. It's well-known out there,  
[00:02:41] but they have amazing UIs and web layouts, and 
quite a lot of creativity in one place. I always  
[00:02:49] browse Dribbble when I want to explore original, 
creative concepts for web design. Yes, I know some  
[00:02:55] are a bit over the top or not really usable for my 
products, but it still has a great collection of  
[00:03:01] designs. And this is also the reason I don't 
like Awwwards. The pages there look amazing;  
[00:03:07] they are state-of-the-art, pushing the boundaries 
of what's possible on the front-end. But these  
[00:03:12] pages also tend to load very slowly, you have to 
scroll quite a lot to understand what's going on,  
[00:03:19] and all of that doesn't help when it comes to 
making a sale, well, at least for my products.
[00:03:27] Let's move on to Codrops. Codrops has been out 
for ages, and it's one of the best resources for  
[00:03:35] web design tutorials and inspiration. Codrops not 
only shows you visually rich designs, but the code  
[00:03:42] is actually open-source, so you can check out how 
it works in detail. I know a lot of examples here  
[00:03:49] are also a bit crazy, but you can also just pick a 
certain element of it and use it to give your site  
[00:03:55] something special. And that's also what I did for 
ResumePhoto. I have a section here where I wanted  
[00:04:01] to show the selfie, which is the before image, 
and the AI-generated headshot, which is the after  
[00:04:07] image. And when you hover over the image, you 
will see this transition from before and after.
[00:04:17] Let's move on to BentoGrids. BentoGrids have 
become increasingly popular over the years.  
[00:04:23] I'm not sure if Apple invented them, but they 
definitely made them popular. I'm also a huge  
[00:04:29] fan of the layout; they are modular, flexible, 
and allow you to organize content into visually  
[00:04:35] appealing tiles. To be honest, I also struggled to 
come up with a nice-looking design for BentoGrids.  
[00:04:42] That's when I discovered the website, Well, 
also called BentoGrids, and they feature  
[00:04:48] you can get inspiration from. They have a ton 
of examples from other products and websites,  
[00:04:54] and this actually helped me to come up 
with my own BentoGrid for ResumePhoto.
[00:05:02] The last page I want to cover is 
UncoverLab. This is a page I have  
[00:05:06] stumbled upon recently, and it has a ton of 
great designs for designers and developers,  
[00:05:12] especially if you're working on B2B websites 
and applications. They have a growing library  
[00:05:17] of ready-made templates for Figma, for 
example, you can grab a hero section,  
[00:05:23] pricing section, or even a newsletter call 
section without having to design them from  
[00:05:28] scratch. It's all there. Personally, I 
found these designs to be clean, modern,  
[00:05:34] and very B2B-focused, which makes it super 
easy to plug and play without overthinking.
[00:05:43] I have like 30 more resources on my webpage, 
and I only want to pick the ones I'm using  
[00:05:48] on a daily basis. And if you're a developer 
and you struggle with design, and trust me,  
[00:05:52] you're not the only one, try to challenge yourself 
to build something you have seen on Dribbble or  
[00:05:57] on BentoGrids. Use whatever text editor you 
want - React, Vue - it doesn't really matter.  
[00:06:02] And just try to copy what you see on the screen by 
recreating those components. You will improve your  
[00:06:08] skills exponentially. Try to do this a couple 
of times, and you will quickly realize that by  
[00:06:13] doing so, you will get a better understanding of 
the small but important details. That's also what  
[00:06:19] I did when I started to learn design. I tried to 
replicate what I have seen on Dribbble or Behance.
[00:06:27] So if you are struggling to get into development 
or design, I get it. You see a beautiful website  
[00:06:32] out there, and you think, "that's something I 
could never build." But trust me, you can. All  
[00:06:38] the resources you need are out there, and 
on top of that, we have now something like  
[00:06:43] GitHub where you can ask questions and report 
the errors you have to improve your code. I'm  
[00:06:50] using it all the time to bounce off ideas 
or to fix some issues I have with my code.
[00:06:55] I hope you like the resources I have collected. 
If you did, please leave a like and subscribe to  
[00:07:00] the channel. Keep designing, keep building, 
and I will see you in the next one. Bye.
