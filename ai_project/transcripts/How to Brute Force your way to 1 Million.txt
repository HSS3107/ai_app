[00:00:00] let's get something out of the way $1
[00:00:02] million is not what it used to be yeah
[00:00:06] it's not going to be enough to live a
[00:00:07] lavish lifestyle for the rest of your
[00:00:09] life but it will definitely make your
[00:00:11] life exponentially better than it is
[00:00:13] right now here's something 99% of the
[00:00:16] population doesn't know which is why
[00:00:18] they're not in the 1% you don't earn a
[00:00:21] million dollar you make a million dollar
[00:00:25] yes there's a super select few jobs that
[00:00:28] can get you there like Pro a aete singer
[00:00:31] or top level software engineer but for
[00:00:33] the rest of the jobs out there you won't
[00:00:35] even come close which is why you have to
[00:00:37] create value and exchange it for money
[00:00:41] by the end of this video we'll show you
[00:00:43] how to brute force your way to $1
[00:00:46] million welcome to alux the place where
[00:00:49] future billionaires come to get
[00:00:51] inspired so going from0 to $1 million
[00:00:55] can take between 3 to 10 years depending
[00:00:57] on your skills technical knoow
[00:01:00] relationships and your ability to use
[00:01:02] the tools you have at your disposal if
[00:01:04] you've got all of them unlock well
[00:01:06] there's no reason why you can't brute
[00:01:08] force your way to $1 million in 3 years
[00:01:11] even if you're starting from scratch
[00:01:13] people are doing it every single day in
[00:01:15] a variety of Industries and okay calm
[00:01:18] down calm down we're not going to sell
[00:01:19] you some kind of day trading course tell
[00:01:21] you about some hot crypto or the latest
[00:01:24] AI super secret tool this video is about
[00:01:27] a handful of actions that you can do
[00:01:29] starting right now to build toward that
[00:01:31] million dollars we want you to pay close
[00:01:34] attention to the following graph because
[00:01:36] this is based on both personal
[00:01:38] experience and data we've collected from
[00:01:40] several companies in which we're
[00:01:42] invested they all follow the same
[00:01:44] pattern and although your personal time
[00:01:47] frame might be slightly different some
[00:01:49] might be able to do it in 3 years While
[00:01:51] others will take a bit longer the
[00:01:53] process is very similar for the majority
[00:01:55] of companies out there this graph
[00:01:58] applies to both your business and your
[00:02:00] net worth as an individual if you look
[00:02:02] closely at it you'll distinguish three
[00:02:05] very different stages of growth as
[00:02:07] follows so phase one nothing happens
[00:02:11] you're putting in so much effort but
[00:02:13] it's all chaos you don't know what to do
[00:02:16] who to hire what the customer wants what
[00:02:18] to price it what your business model is
[00:02:21] and more we call this the learn and
[00:02:24] build phase this is the figuring
[00:02:26] out phase you're dumb and this phase
[00:02:29] fixes that
[00:02:30] during this period people will dismiss
[00:02:32] your efforts they'll laugh at your goals
[00:02:34] and disregard anything you do they'll
[00:02:37] tell you that you should do something
[00:02:38] else and as you go through it the worst
[00:02:41] thing is it feels like they're right
[00:02:44] it's already been over a year and still
[00:02:46] nothing to show for it this stage is
[00:02:49] where 90% of businesses quit but you're
[00:02:53] not like them you will put your head
[00:02:55] down and you will keep building learn
[00:02:58] fast and build in silent
[00:03:00] the quicker you're able to learn and
[00:03:02] Implement new found knowledge the
[00:03:04] quicker you're going to be able to grow
[00:03:06] this is why we built learning Mastery
[00:03:09] learning how to learn is probably the
[00:03:11] most valuable skill to acquire if you're
[00:03:13] in the early stages of your growth in
[00:03:15] phas one you are the one doing almost
[00:03:18] all the work on a shoestring budget
[00:03:20] you've got a hand in everything and
[00:03:22] you're mastering the skills required for
[00:03:24] you to evolve in Phase 2 now Phase 2 is
[00:03:28] very different compar compared to phase
[00:03:30] one because now you're seeing some
[00:03:32] traction out of all the things that
[00:03:34] you've learned in Phase 1 some of them
[00:03:36] have found footing and are now picking
[00:03:38] up speed you've put together a minimum
[00:03:41] viable team you've got a few customers
[00:03:43] and the business model has been proven a
[00:03:46] few people have actually given you money
[00:03:48] now it's just a matter of doing it over
[00:03:50] and over again we call Phase 2 the
[00:03:54] optimized traction phase because if you
[00:03:56] look at the graph it's almost linear you
[00:03:59] start to Tinker with the details you
[00:04:02] train your people you hire more specific
[00:04:04] talent because this time you know what
[00:04:06] you're hiring for you're still in
[00:04:08] complete control of your growth journey
[00:04:10] and it feels like you figured it all out
[00:04:13] at this stage you're able to understand
[00:04:15] what your competitors are doing and how
[00:04:17] they're moving in the optimized traction
[00:04:20] phase you're actively competing with
[00:04:22] everyone else in your space for
[00:04:24] customers attention followers Etc you
[00:04:28] are growing but you're not yet
[00:04:30] differentiated enough you still haven't
[00:04:32] found your secret sauce at this stage
[00:04:36] all you want to do is to streamline the
[00:04:38] entire process as much as possible cut
[00:04:41] out the fat build up systems and hire
[00:04:44] people to take over some of the tasks
[00:04:45] that you were previously in charge of
[00:04:48] it's only then that you'll be able to
[00:04:49] take a step back zoom out and look at
[00:04:52] the bigger picture and that is when it
[00:04:55] happens phase three we call it the
[00:04:58] liftoff stage so pay very close
[00:05:01] attention to this graph because over 90%
[00:05:03] of your wealth will be generated here in
[00:05:06] phase three this is where something
[00:05:09] simply clicks the liftoff stage usually
[00:05:12] happens when you figure out how to scale
[00:05:15] exponentially over time so instead of
[00:05:17] building once and selling once you
[00:05:20] figure out how to build once and sell a
[00:05:23] million times instead of picking one
[00:05:26] customer after another your focus shifts
[00:05:29] to building the things that bring in
[00:05:31] customers on a consistent basis in phase
[00:05:34] three you're no longer going after the
[00:05:36] client instead you become a client
[00:05:39] magnet your brand becomes well known
[00:05:42] your funnel starts working your ads have
[00:05:45] a positive Roi Network effects are in
[00:05:49] play where customers recommend you to
[00:05:51] others through word of mouth all of this
[00:05:54] puts you in a very peculiar situation
[00:05:57] for the first time in your life demand
[00:05:59] is higher than what you can deliver
[00:06:01] figure out how to fill in all that
[00:06:03] demand and you win these are the three
[00:06:06] phases of your financial journey in
[00:06:08] order to be able to take advantage of
[00:06:10] exponential growth you have to embrace
[00:06:13] asymmetric risk out of everything out
[00:06:16] there it's the fastest way to build and
[00:06:18] you can click in the top right corner
[00:06:20] because we have a video dedicated to
[00:06:21] asymmetric risk and how to apply it you
[00:06:25] can't have exponential growth as an
[00:06:27] employee you need to in incorporate and
[00:06:30] build a business so how do you actually
[00:06:33] do that how do you brute force your way
[00:06:36] to $1
[00:06:37] million well you might have noticed that
[00:06:39] on the graph we mentioned earlier there
[00:06:41] are 10 distinct points labeled with the
[00:06:44] letters of the alphabet now we're going
[00:06:46] to walk you through these 10 stages so
[00:06:48] you can properly assess where you are on
[00:06:51] your own Journey you start in the left
[00:06:54] corner at zero you have just an idea but
[00:06:58] you don't know where to start
[00:07:00] as you can see it takes a while to get
[00:07:02] from the corner to the first a point now
[00:07:05] the a point is where you make a decision
[00:07:08] to start a is the first day you actually
[00:07:11] get to work on your business for example
[00:07:14] you register a domain name you put
[00:07:16] together a website you list your first
[00:07:18] product or somehow announce to the world
[00:07:21] that you're now doing this at this stage
[00:07:24] you're using money from your own pocket
[00:07:26] and it feels like an incredible risk
[00:07:28] because you don't have much for the sake
[00:07:30] of this video let's say you're starting
[00:07:32] with under 100 bucks not a lot of money
[00:07:35] but you do have a lot of time so you're
[00:07:37] going to do everything yourself that's
[00:07:40] when you use all the technological
[00:07:42] advances that you can use Instagram is
[00:07:45] free Tik Tok is free if you go to
[00:07:47] alo.com sell you can have an online
[00:07:50] store with full functionality up and
[00:07:52] running before the end of the day thanks
[00:07:54] to our friends at Shopify who are kind
[00:07:56] enough to support our platform now at
[00:07:59] the B point you've been putting things
[00:08:02] together for a while there has been some
[00:08:04] interest but nothing much has changed
[00:08:06] yet you're learning a lot but you're
[00:08:09] kind of starting to lose Faith it's been
[00:08:12] almost a year since you thought about
[00:08:14] this idea but it hasn't moved very much
[00:08:17] this is the most common point where
[00:08:19] people quit the B point is a test to see
[00:08:22] who's willing to stick with it you're
[00:08:24] not making any money but you are making
[00:08:27] progress It's At this point where true
[00:08:30] determination and discipline breaks
[00:08:32] through tremendous amounts of rejection
[00:08:35] you have to do it the hard way you'll
[00:08:37] have to send 100 DMS to get one reply
[00:08:41] you'll have to post 100 pictures on
[00:08:43] Instagram to get one order you'll have
[00:08:46] to cold call 100 businesses until one of
[00:08:49] them allows you to pitch and maybe
[00:08:51] convert but do it do it 100 times and
[00:08:54] then do it another 100 times because
[00:08:57] what moves the needle at this stage is
[00:08:59] volume you need a lot of volume the B
[00:09:04] point is where you begin to understand
[00:09:06] how you can make money the hard way if
[00:09:08] it takes 100 pitches to land a client
[00:09:11] then do 500 pitches if you must remember
[00:09:15] why you started this was supposed to
[00:09:18] take care of you for the rest of your
[00:09:19] life are you really going to quit 6
[00:09:21] months to one year into it what's the
[00:09:24] matter with you focus okay you're here
[00:09:26] for the long game all of that effort is
[00:09:29] what's going to get you to the C point
[00:09:32] it ain't much but it's honest work you
[00:09:35] finally figured out how much effort it
[00:09:38] takes to land one client this isn't your
[00:09:41] mom okay it's not your friend or someone
[00:09:43] feeling bad for you a genuine interested
[00:09:47] party gave you money in exchange for
[00:09:49] your services or product this is the
[00:09:52] game-changing moment for any business
[00:09:54] the moment you realize that you can do
[00:09:56] this over and over again your product
[00:09:59] service delivers it's just a matter of
[00:10:01] keeping up with it the C point is a
[00:10:04] moment of transition between an idea
[00:10:06] that's being executed into reality at
[00:10:09] this point you're still doing almost all
[00:10:12] of it yourself you are the designer
[00:10:15] provider you take care of shipping or
[00:10:17] services rendered you are the tech
[00:10:19] support and the sales agent the moment
[00:10:22] that payment hits your account it just
[00:10:25] validates your entire effort even if
[00:10:27] it's not very much you know you have a
[00:10:29] business a genuine business so it's time
[00:10:32] you make it profitable keep doing it we
[00:10:35] know it's hard okay it is hard but you
[00:10:38] just have to push through and if you do
[00:10:41] things will start to look better that's
[00:10:42] when you land at the D Point you're
[00:10:46] almost 2 years into this journey when
[00:10:48] things are slowly picking up speed
[00:10:50] you've got a few satisfied clients and
[00:10:52] the business is dripping a little bit of
[00:10:54] money you've been super busy for a while
[00:10:57] now and this is where you realize you
[00:10:59] need some help at the D Point you're
[00:11:02] getting your first employee now don't
[00:11:04] get us wrong you still work at 100% of
[00:11:07] your own capacity but there's someone
[00:11:09] else working alongside you just keep in
[00:11:12] mind they are not you they will never be
[00:11:15] able to work just as hard or as
[00:11:17] thoroughly as you do but because they
[00:11:19] earn their own bread and make your life
[00:11:21] just a bit easier it allows you to focus
[00:11:23] more on growth at this stage of the
[00:11:25] business you're still not paying
[00:11:27] yourself but you are paying this person
[00:11:30] basically the money coming in goes
[00:11:32] toward paying your first employee but
[00:11:34] that's okay because you start to see
[00:11:36] that growth trajectory takes shape
[00:11:39] because of this new found help you're
[00:11:40] able to steadily increase the income of
[00:11:43] the business which gets us to the E
[00:11:46] point it might not look like much but
[00:11:48] you're actually killing it right now you
[00:11:51] found a sustainable way to linearly
[00:11:53] scale your business and now you've got a
[00:11:55] way of hiring people if you look at the
[00:11:57] graph you're bringing in at at least
[00:11:59] twice as much money as you did at the
[00:12:01] previous point you already know what to
[00:12:03] do of course you're not going to hit the
[00:12:05] club instead you will reinvest every
[00:12:08] single dollar coming in you're still
[00:12:11] living way below your means but this is
[00:12:13] a game of delayed gratification you're
[00:12:16] eating now so you can eat whatever
[00:12:18] you want later on so you hire another
[00:12:21] person to help you increase sales even
[00:12:23] more and guess what it works this is a
[00:12:28] crucial stage in your growth Journey
[00:12:30] you've made some progress but you feel
[00:12:32] overwhelmed by the realization of just
[00:12:34] how much you don't know and have yet to
[00:12:37] learn the highest cost you'll pay in
[00:12:40] life is on the things you don't know
[00:12:42] that you don't know so as a side quest
[00:12:45] outside of your day-to-day business
[00:12:47] operations you start learning you spend
[00:12:50] days reading books paying hundreds if
[00:12:52] not thousands of dollars going to
[00:12:54] business events unsure if you'll be able
[00:12:56] to build a real network but you buy
[00:12:59] courses and listen to hours of podcasts
[00:13:02] about business it's not very efficient
[00:13:05] but all of it helps and we struggled
[00:13:07] with this because there wasn't one
[00:13:09] resource out there specifically built to
[00:13:12] fill in the gaps that we had so we built
[00:13:14] it ourselves we spent millions of
[00:13:17] dollars getting the smartest people in
[00:13:18] the world to share with us exactly how
[00:13:21] to do it we put all of it into an app
[00:13:23] called alux available to download for
[00:13:25] free at alux.com
[00:13:27] slapp it's the only app designed to
[00:13:30] accelerate your progress on this graph
[00:13:32] curve every morning you'll get 15
[00:13:35] minutes of coaching handpicked to help
[00:13:37] you make measurable progress it's not
[00:13:39] cheap but most users say the app paid
[00:13:41] for itself in the first month alone
[00:13:44] hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs
[00:13:46] just like you use the alux app as their
[00:13:48] guide and coach and we do not want you
[00:13:51] to be left out so if you've got the app
[00:13:53] downloaded on your phone and scan the QR
[00:13:55] code on screen right now you'll get 25%
[00:13:58] off your yearly membership as a gift for
[00:14:01] being an alux subscriber all right so
[00:14:04] between the E point and the F Point most
[00:14:07] people realize that their speed of
[00:14:08] growth is a knowledge problem you don't
[00:14:11] know how to do it so you can let our
[00:14:14] International experts help you out there
[00:14:17] because at the F point you've already
[00:14:19] hired a few people and the chart is
[00:14:21] already going up so you begin to think
[00:14:23] bigger and now you're a bit more
[00:14:25] technical with your business because you
[00:14:27] know what works and what doesn't
[00:14:29] Plus for the first time you're making a
[00:14:31] considerable amount of money compared to
[00:14:33] anything you've done before so this is
[00:14:36] usually where you upgrade your
[00:14:38] infrastructure and the quality of your
[00:14:40] products or Services you invest in a new
[00:14:42] website you do a redesign of the
[00:14:44] products you begin to buy raw materials
[00:14:46] in bulk because now you've got a
[00:14:48] predictable demand so you can negotiate
[00:14:50] on costs and increase your profit margin
[00:14:53] you're 3 years into the process and for
[00:14:56] the first time this is when you know
[00:14:58] exactly what you need to grow your
[00:15:00] business so you reinvest everything
[00:15:03] again and make a few changes while still
[00:15:06] keeping up with the grind and it shows
[00:15:09] you do it over and over again until you
[00:15:11] hit that G-spot you know okay that's a
[00:15:13] childish joke but we're going to run
[00:15:15] with it the G point for the first time
[00:15:18] ever your wealth is over
[00:15:20] $100,000 and you feel like you're on top
[00:15:23] of the world you've got a good thing
[00:15:25] going you understand the customer you
[00:15:27] understand production but there's one
[00:15:29] thing missing wide distribution you've
[00:15:33] got a good product that people are
[00:15:35] willing to pay for this is the golden
[00:15:37] spot to be in this is where you need to
[00:15:39] take your marketing seriously you need a
[00:15:42] sustainable way to reach more people a
[00:15:45] lot more people take some of the money
[00:15:47] that you're making and start
[00:15:49] experimenting but be very careful at
[00:15:51] this stage a bunch of smaller companies
[00:15:53] will come knocking on your door
[00:15:55] promising you the moon almost all of
[00:15:57] them are art artists they don't
[00:15:59] care about your business they don't
[00:16:01] understand your business they just want
[00:16:04] your hard-earned money so don't trust
[00:16:06] them first try to do it yourself this
[00:16:09] will teach you how to speak the language
[00:16:11] and how to distinguish between the
[00:16:13] pretenders and the real ones and just
[00:16:16] giving you a heads up here you're going
[00:16:18] to get burned a few times it's
[00:16:20] inevitable as with everything in life
[00:16:22] you will have to kiss a few frogs until
[00:16:24] you find one that turns into a prince
[00:16:26] it's rarely going to be an agency
[00:16:29] instead it's going to be someone you
[00:16:30] bring in full-time that is passionate
[00:16:33] about this space this is usually the
[00:16:35] moment you have someone taking care of
[00:16:37] your marketing efforts fulltime it'll
[00:16:39] take them between 12 to 24 months until
[00:16:42] they get good at it and then boom it
[00:16:45] happens H Point we've got takeoff now
[00:16:49] believe it or not the H Point comes with
[00:16:51] a problem you never expected the
[00:16:54] marketing part worked so well that you
[00:16:56] are now at capacity at this point you
[00:16:59] simply can't keep up with demand you're
[00:17:01] now turning down potential orders
[00:17:03] because you don't have the
[00:17:05] infrastructure to fulfill all of them
[00:17:07] your business doesn't scale turns out
[00:17:10] there's more to building a well-oiled
[00:17:11] business machine than just sales but
[00:17:14] don't panic okay this is an incredible
[00:17:17] position to find yourself in luckily for
[00:17:19] you the business is Cash flowing and as
[00:17:22] everyone in business knows sales cures
[00:17:26] everything use that money to hire more
[00:17:28] people bring in new technology and
[00:17:30] automate what you can in order to
[00:17:32] streamline production even more at this
[00:17:35] stage of the business you've got
[00:17:36] multiple employees taking care of
[00:17:38] different parts of the business you've
[00:17:40] got people in production you've got
[00:17:42] people in sales and you've got people in
[00:17:44] marketing and even more importantly this
[00:17:46] is where you have a manager in place
[00:17:49] that keeps the business running from a
[00:17:50] day-to-day perspective you used to be
[00:17:53] that manager now you hire a manager to
[00:17:56] do what the title says to manage
[00:17:59] your focus is on business growth and on
[00:18:01] the quality of the product or service
[00:18:03] that you offer be very careful at this
[00:18:06] stage because of the size of the
[00:18:08] business and the many people involved
[00:18:11] the quality will inevitably suffer your
[00:18:13] manager isn't you and although in theory
[00:18:16] you'll want them to be as obsessed with
[00:18:18] a business as you are they're not
[00:18:21] remember they don't care about the
[00:18:23] little things the same way that you do
[00:18:26] so quality control is key it was the
[00:18:29] little things and the attention to
[00:18:30] detail that people were rushing to buy
[00:18:32] from you in the first place so do your
[00:18:35] best to keep those
[00:18:37] Alive Now lucky for you after a couple
[00:18:39] of tweaks your people are able to keep
[00:18:41] the machine running and you can focus on
[00:18:43] your superpower making the business
[00:18:46] bigger all this effort all of this
[00:18:49] attention you're getting can now be
[00:18:51] monetized through the new structure so
[00:18:53] flip the switch the eye point if you've
[00:18:57] been able to not only maintain but
[00:18:59] improve the quality of your offering and
[00:19:01] reach the desired customer audience
[00:19:03] through effective marketing your
[00:19:05] business is now growing exponentially at
[00:19:08] this stage you're likely doing between
[00:19:10] $1 and $5 million in Revenue per year
[00:19:13] and you're comfortable taking some money
[00:19:15] out of the company you've earned it now
[00:19:17] we know that most people might be
[00:19:19] shocked to hear $5 million in Revenue
[00:19:21] but so little money for yourself well
[00:19:24] these people don't understand product
[00:19:26] margins what it takes to keep people on
[00:19:28] payroll what advertising budgets are and
[00:19:30] how to balance all of that for a
[00:19:33] positive return on investment building a
[00:19:35] solid business is hard because there are
[00:19:38] so many moving pieces and parts that
[00:19:40] need to be accounted for you are paying
[00:19:42] taxes you're buying equipment and almost
[00:19:45] all of that profit gets reinvested
[00:19:47] you've been barely paying yourself
[00:19:49] anything up until now at the eye point
[00:19:53] it's the first time you begin to slowly
[00:19:55] increase the quality of your life that's
[00:19:58] why it's called the eye point it's about
[00:20:00] yourself until you get to this point you
[00:20:03] have to train your brain to focus on
[00:20:05] growth instead of pleasure it doesn't
[00:20:09] mean you have to suffer okay but you
[00:20:11] have to be purposeful in your spending
[00:20:14] it's a slippery slope that you need to
[00:20:16] check and it's at this stage you can
[00:20:18] zoom out a bit and look at the business
[00:20:21] differently it's at this stage you'll
[00:20:23] apply pto's law to Business Development
[00:20:27] 20% of your efforts generate 80% of the
[00:20:30] reward so you focus all of your efforts
[00:20:33] on that 20% you look for strategic
[00:20:36] Partnerships or big business deals that
[00:20:38] will bring in value over longer periods
[00:20:41] of time instead of selling to One
[00:20:43] customer at a time you sell in bulk to a
[00:20:46] wholesaler instead of hiring one person
[00:20:49] you're Outsourcing a segment to a
[00:20:51] full-on business it's this type of
[00:20:53] effort that will get the business to
[00:20:55] maintain that extraordinary growth
[00:20:57] momentum EV eventually getting you to
[00:20:59] that J Point J stands for Joy you have
[00:21:03] to officially build a strong enough
[00:21:05] business that can take care of you and
[00:21:07] your family for the foreseeable future

[00:21:32] it going in your place or maybe sell it
[00:21:34] off for a lump of cash this kind of
[00:21:37] video is incredibly important for those
[00:21:38] of you who are actually building we
[00:21:41] could have easily wrapped it up in a
[00:21:42] workshop or a seminar and charged people
[00:21:44] for this kind of info but we're here

[00:22:18] until the very end here's a special
[00:22:20] bonus that we want to share with you
[00:22:22] this is the excitement graph in your
[00:22:24] journey you start out incredibly excited
[00:22:28] PE peing at the day you decide to launch
[00:22:30] then you figure out just how hard it all
[00:22:32] is and that you've got so much to learn
[00:22:34] and are missing a bunch of things most
[00:22:37] of you are probably right here in the
[00:22:39] dip this is called the valley of
[00:22:42] disappointment and we'll make a detailed
[00:22:44] video on this in the near future if
[00:22:46] you're in the valley of disappointment
[00:22:49] alux sir please just keep on going okay
[00:22:52] we promise you it will get better and it
[00:22:54] will get better fast the surprising
[00:22:56] thing is that most accelerated
[00:22:58] excitement growth is in Phase 2 that's
[00:23:01] where the business starts picking up
[00:23:02] traction and you can correlate your work
[00:23:05] to actual returns you'll find that you
[00:23:08] draw purpose from your work and it's
[00:23:10] making you happy phase two is what
[00:23:13] validates you as in individual you are
[00:23:16] indeed able to build something of value
[00:23:19] although you'll make 80% of your wealth
[00:23:21] in phase three the excitement slowly
[00:23:24] flatlines as you build your wealth now
[00:23:27] we already mentioned that the time frame
[00:23:29] might be different so just adjust it to
[00:23:31] your own life but we didn't choose the
[00:23:33] 5year period randomly okay we've been in
[00:23:36] hundreds of meetings with serial
[00:23:38] entrepreneurs Venture capitalists and
[00:23:40] startups and we've identified this
[00:23:42] pattern across the board after 5 years
[00:23:46] something needs to change a new wave
[00:23:48] needs to come the business needs to
[00:23:51] evolve every half a decade 5 years in
[00:23:54] and you no longer find the same business
[00:23:56] model sexy you need to upgrade it to
[00:23:59] change pivot expand or go after a
[00:24:02] different Market to keep yourself
[00:24:03] interested and entertained from that
[00:24:05] point forward it's no longer about the
[00:24:07] money until you realize you're actually
[00:24:09] pretty good at making money so you begin
[00:24:11] to challenge yourself to see just how
[00:24:13] big you can get it now since it's only
[00:24:16] the true aluxes left here anyway we can
[00:24:18] share a private and personal perspective
[00:24:20] with you guys it happened the very same
[00:24:23] way with alux it took roughly 4 and 1/2
[00:24:25] years for us to completely dominate the
[00:24:27] blogging space
[00:24:28] and we started to feel an itch for
[00:24:30] change so we shifted into video after
[00:24:33] almost a decade of building a community
[00:24:35] on YouTube we had to evolve again which
[00:24:38] is why a couple of years ago we launched
[00:24:40] the alux app and the same cycle applies
[00:24:43] first growth was slow but we tweaked it
[00:24:46] we reinvested all the money we made into
[00:24:48] making that product more valuable for
[00:24:50] you the users 2 and 1/2 years in and
[00:24:53] we're beginning to see that gross curve
[00:24:55] happen exactly as we outlined in the
[00:24:57] graph even with our experience of
[00:24:59] building and investing in multiple
[00:25:01] companies it still requires us to go
[00:25:03] through the cycle and it'll probably be
[00:25:05] the same for you but with every attempt
[00:25:08] the reward has gotten a lot bigger if
[00:25:10] alux.com the website was Charmander and
[00:25:14] YouTube is Charmeleon well the app is
[00:25:17] proving to be the Charizard version of
[00:25:20] alux we want alux to evolve and in the
[00:25:23] process help you to evolve let's do it
[00:25:26] together my friend if if you're ready
[00:25:28] for it write evolution in the comments
[00:25:32] let's see how many of you are ready for
[00:25:34] what comes next
