[00:00:00] With the caveat that we know you're not
an expert on Middle East affairs.
[00:00:03] You are certainly not unfamiliar to how
geopolitics affects the investor psyche
[00:00:09] and affects investment planning.
When you have something like this that
[00:00:12] for a lot of people was a surprise.
What is sort of the first thing that you
[00:00:17] look to in terms of telling your
clients, your colleagues, your peers to
[00:00:22] do next?
Well, the important thing is to separate
[00:00:24] the noise from signals.
And I think unfortunately, or perhaps
[00:00:29] fortunately and I don't mean to sound
dismissive, the markets have been
[00:00:33] conditioned in the last few years to
react temporarily to these issues.
[00:00:38] They will bid up safe haven prices,
gold, oil, treasury prices.
[00:00:44] But then as soon as they get the all
clear signal that things are under
[00:00:48] control, they'll put it behind them and
go back to whatever they were doing.
[00:00:53] So, so long.
We don't get further escalation in the
[00:00:55] coming days.
I think the market will up past it.
[00:00:58] Now, one of these days it will be proven
wrong because I do agree something has
[00:01:02] to get worked out in the long run.
And, you know, the conflict seems to
[00:01:06] just be escalating.
I am curious about the cumulative effect
[00:01:09] of various sort of wars and other
conflicts obviously have what's going on
[00:01:13] between Iran and Israel.
Obviously, the Ukraine Russia war
[00:01:17] continues to go on.
You have other big geopolitical
[00:01:19] disruptions going on around the globe,
not to mention a changing of the guard
[00:01:23] in terms of presidential elections
around the globe that are really going
[00:01:27] to reshape foreign policy.
This is much different.
[00:01:30] Right now, what we're seeing that maybe
what we've seen in past cycles here, how
[00:01:34] do you adjust?
I think you want to weigh the different
[00:01:38] issues.
I think at least in the near term, I
[00:01:41] think the bigger catalyst is the US
election.
[00:01:45] If you have a Harries administration
with a Republican controlled Senate that
[00:01:50] will be viewed as largely status quo.
If you have a Trump victory, I actually
[00:01:54] think that's going to be very disruptive
as far as the foreign policies, you
[00:01:59] know, pertaining to the war in Ukraine,
support for Israel.
[00:02:03] You know, whether you guess, you know,
more assertive and also tariffs issues.
[00:02:07] So potentially the election can turn out
to be more disruptive
[00:02:12] in terms of just the US markets and how
they respond to these Exodus events.
[00:02:16] I think about what happened with China,
the weeklong stimulus package that they
[00:02:21] announced and how little impact it had
on the US market overall in terms of
[00:02:24] lifting sentiment and really inspiring
people to go outside the US.
[00:02:29] And then you have the news today with
Iran attacking Israel.
[00:02:32] And yes, there is certainly a movement
in stocks and in oil, but if in the long
[00:02:37] term people are going to look past it,
what is it about the US market that has
[00:02:41] its participants looking inward as
opposed to digesting the headlines from
[00:02:46] outside?
I think over the last ten plus years
[00:02:49] investors have been conditioned to
overweight the US, so we tend to dismiss
[00:02:53] what happens overseas.
In fact, you hear a lot of people saying
[00:02:56] that China is just investable.
And then last week we get a sudden
[00:03:00] surprise with a pretty strong stimulus
on the monetary side and also the PBOC
[00:03:06] lending money to companies and investors
to buy stocks.
[00:03:10] So you get a nice pop in the Asian
market.
[00:03:13] So temporarily, that could mean
outperformance by emerging markets.
[00:03:17] But again, the election could be
disruptive because depending on the
[00:03:21] tariffs policies.
Right.
[00:03:22] That can again disrupt the emerging
market rally.
[00:03:26] How much are you seeing your clients ask
you about the election?
[00:03:30] Because you point out all these
different scenarios, but we might not
[00:03:33] get an answer until as late as January.
Most people are obviously interested,
[00:03:39] but we tend to have a very long term
view, so the strategic allocation has
[00:03:44] not been altered.
In the meantime, tactically, you could
[00:03:48] play out a different scenario.
So, for example, if you have a blue
[00:03:51] sweep, I think the market will probably
view it as somewhat negative for
[00:03:56] equities and positive for bonds.
If you have a risk sweep, that's
[00:03:59] potentially more inflationary.
So it's negative to bounce, but then
[00:04:03] equities may do well.
On the belief of deregulation,
[00:04:05] potentially lower taxes.
If you have a split, government is
[00:04:08] probably a muted impact.
I am curious though, we talk about some
[00:04:12] of the tailwinds for this market heading
into this election.
[00:04:15] Interest rates finally coming down, an
economy that's at least doing better
[00:04:19] than I think what people had anticipated
here, no matter what the outcome of that
[00:04:24] November 5th election.
Is it possible that those tailwinds
[00:04:27] could outweigh any potential negatives
we get from the election itself?
[00:04:31] Right now, the thesis is synchronized
global easing with the exception of Bank
[00:04:35] of Japan.
I counted in September we've had 25 rate
[00:04:39] cut announcements across the globe.
So people will see September 25, 25
[00:04:44] across the world.
So that's the thesis.
[00:04:47] But then if you have a Trump victory
potentially driving up inflation with
[00:04:51] new tariffs, potentially higher economic
activities.
[00:04:55] Would that then disrupt the rate easing
the interest rate cutting cycle?
[00:05:00] The market is pricing in.
So I do think potentially there could be
[00:05:03] some risk to the Treasury market.
Are you concerned at all about some of
[00:05:08] the other risks that have been bubbling
up?
[00:05:09] We have a port strike that just started
today that could have significant
[00:05:13] economic consequences should it drag on
for four weeks rather than days.
[00:05:17] We have another strike over at Boeing
that's still unresolved, as well as a
[00:05:21] lot of other issues that have the
potential for an inflationary impact as
[00:05:25] well as an economic impact.
Yes, I do agree.
[00:05:27] These are really good points depending
on how long they last and there is an
[00:05:31] impact on inflation and that could
potentially disrupt the market's
[00:05:35] complacency about the interest rate
cutting cycle.
[00:05:38] And at some point, inflation could still
make a comeback once everything settles
[00:05:42] down, especially with central banks
being so aggressive on the easing side.
[00:05:47] You know, as much as you say that
investors are conditioned to look past
[00:05:50] these headlines, these hiccups from
overseas.
[00:05:52] Are these latest headlines enough to at
least derail or snuff out the bull
[00:05:57] market?
I mean, are we done with making new
[00:05:58] record highs?
Well, given that we've done so well in
[00:06:01] the second half of September, so a
little bit of pullback is normal.
[00:06:05] I don't think it's enough to really
derail the bull market.
[00:06:08] So I you know, anything, you know, maybe
a 5% pullback and then the focus in two
[00:06:13] weeks will be on the earnings season and
the elections.
