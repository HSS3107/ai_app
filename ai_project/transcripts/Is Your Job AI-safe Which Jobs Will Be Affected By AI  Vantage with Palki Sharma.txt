[00:00:03] every year India produces 1.5 million
[00:00:06] Engineers 1 and a half million but do
[00:00:08] you know how many can build a core AI
[00:00:10] product just about 2,000 imagine that
[00:00:14] artificial intelligence is a future
[00:00:16] according to the international monetary
[00:00:17] fund AI will affect 40% of all jobs in
[00:00:20] the future 40 40% and the world seems
[00:00:24] unprepared for it and so are India's
[00:00:26] Engineers according to a new report 67%
[00:00:29] of them think that AI will take their
[00:00:31] jobs
[00:00:33] 87% are considering
[00:00:35] upskilling will that be enough to safu
[00:00:38] their careers our next report tells
[00:00:41] you the world of artificial intelligence
[00:00:44] every day there are new products new
[00:00:46] Innovations yet the people making them
[00:00:48] are
[00:00:49] few that makes AI Talent limited but
[00:00:53] while AI jobs are in demand what about
[00:00:55] other jobs is artificial intelligence
[00:00:58] going to replace them
[00:01:00] a report by the international monetary
[00:01:02] fund says that artificial intelligence
[00:01:04] could impact 300 million jobs that's
[00:01:07] about 99.1% of all jobs in the world
[00:01:11] according to the IMF 40% of all jobs
[00:01:13] will be affected by AI in some way or
[00:01:16] the other by
[00:01:17] 2025 in Europe alone 68% people fear
[00:01:21] they could lose their job due to
[00:01:23] AI so AI is coming for your job and the
[00:01:27] world is worried including India's
[00:01:31] Engineers 67% of them fear AI could
[00:01:34] negatively impact their jobs they fear
[00:01:37] they could lose their jobs but is this
[00:01:40] fear
[00:01:41] warranted well according to estimates
[00:01:43] nearly 40% of all engineering jobs could
[00:01:46] be automated in the next decade so
[00:01:48] they're not wrong to
[00:01:50] worry according to a 2023 India skills
[00:01:54] report about 60% of India's engineering
[00:01:56] graduates are employable only 45% meet
[00:02:00] the industry
[00:02:01] standards that's because of a variety of
[00:02:04] reasons first there's a surplus of
[00:02:06] graduates India produces over 1.5
[00:02:09] million Engineers each year second most
[00:02:12] of them have a skill Gap they have the
[00:02:15] basic education needed but there's a
[00:02:17] lack of application-based
[00:02:19] Education that means they know the
[00:02:20] theory but fail at the Practical also
[00:02:24] standard engineering courses often don't
[00:02:26] prepare graduates for the workplace
[00:02:30] so what's the solution well the only way
[00:02:33] out is upskilling and India's Engineers
[00:02:36] agree
[00:02:37] 87.5% believe upskilling can future
[00:02:40] prooof their careers 89% want to acquire
[00:02:43] hard skills 86% want to know more about
[00:02:47] generative AI they want to focus more on
[00:02:50] High level problem solving and skills
[00:02:52] that complement AI
[00:02:54] technologies that said engineering is
[00:02:57] not the only job that AI threatens there
[00:02:59] are are several other jobs that could be
[00:03:01] in danger including technical writing
[00:03:04] legal assistance market research
[00:03:06] analysts travel agents translators
[00:03:09] customer service and a lot more a UK
[00:03:12] Think Tank report says that women young
[00:03:15] workers and people who are least paid
[00:03:17] will be the most affected even the
[00:03:19] Indian government said that some routine
[00:03:21] jobs are likely to be
[00:03:24] automated so does that mean that your
[00:03:26] job is in danger well artificial
[00:03:29] intelligence will change the job market
[00:03:31] like any new technology has in the past
[00:03:34] some jobs will become redundant but it
[00:03:36] will also give birth to new
[00:03:39] jobs the IMF says so too we don't know
[00:03:43] what it will look like just yet but one
[00:03:45] thing is for sure AI will reshape the
[00:03:48] world of employment in the years to
[00:03:58] come for
