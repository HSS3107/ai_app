[00:00:00] Here's an interesting math fact about the number 
four. Four is the only number in the English  
[00:00:04] language that is spelled with the same number 
of letters as the number itself. We spell four f  
[00:00:10] o u r and we can easily see there are one 
two three four letters in the number four.  
[00:00:20] Again this is the only number in the English 
language that is spelled with the same number  
[00:00:24] of letters as the number itself. I hope you 
found this interesting. Thank you for watching.
