Description: A Nasa spacecraft is attempting to make history with the closest-ever approach to the Sun.
 
The Parker Solar Probe is plunging into our star's outer atmosphere to try and help us better understand how the Sun works. 
 
It is out of communication for several days and scientists will be waiting for a signal, expected at 05:00 GMT on 28 December, to see if it has survived.

[00:00:00] a NASA spacecraft is set to make history
[00:00:02] today getting closer to the Sun than any
[00:00:04] other human-made object the Parker solar
[00:00:07] probe must survive the radiation and
[00:00:09] extreme temperatures it will encounter
[00:00:12] to solve some of the mysteries about our
[00:00:14] star well our science editor Rebecca
[00:00:16] Morel has
[00:00:18] more our sun in all its fiery Splendor
[00:00:22] we've been studying it for centuries but
[00:00:25] there's still so much we don't know
[00:00:26] about it now the closest ever encounter
[00:00:30] is set to finally shed light on our star
[00:00:33] 3 2 1
[00:00:37] Zer NASA's Parker solar probe blasted
[00:00:40] off in 2018 heading to the center of our
[00:00:42] solar system it's been orbiting our star
[00:00:45] getting ever nearer but this latest
[00:00:47] flyby is taking us to a new frontier to
[00:00:50] touch the sun even though we've had
[00:00:53] missions that have gone very close to
[00:00:55] the Sun that wasn't close enough to get
[00:00:57] into this sort of magic region where all
[00:01:00] of this physics and all of this this all
[00:01:02] of these processes that are happening
[00:01:04] and the the only way to be able to
[00:01:06] understand those processes is to fly
[00:01:08] through them and take the data right
[00:01:11] where all the action is happening this
[00:01:14] mission is breaking records Parker solar
[00:01:17] probe hurtles past the Sun at 430,000 M
[00:01:21] an hour no human-made object has ever
[00:01:24] gone so fast it's the equivalent of
[00:01:26] flying from London to New York in less
[00:01:29] than 30 seconds at its closest it's 3.8
[00:01:33] million miles 6.2 million kilom from our
[00:01:36] Stars surface that's closer than any
[00:01:39] other spacecraft it will have to endure
[00:01:42] scorching temperatures of 1, 1400Â°
[00:01:45] celius as it passes through the sun's
[00:01:47] outer atmosphere known as its Corona and
[00:01:50] this could solve a long-standing mystery
[00:01:53] the corona is really really hot and we
[00:01:55] have no idea why so the surface of the
[00:01:57] Sun is about 6,000 de or so but the
[00:02:00] corona this tenuous outer atmosphere
[00:02:02] that you can see during solar eclipses
[00:02:04] that reaches millions of degrees and
[00:02:07] that is further away from the Sun so how
[00:02:09] is that atmosphere getting hotter the
[00:02:11] mission is also studying the solar wind
[00:02:14] the constant stream of charged particles
[00:02:16] bursting out from the sun's Corona the
[00:02:19] probes even recorded the sounds of the
[00:02:21] sun three different types of solar
[00:02:23] wind dispersive chirping
[00:02:27] waves Lang mure waves
[00:02:29] [Music]
[00:02:31] and Doctor Who like Whistler mode
[00:02:35] waves when these particles interact with
[00:02:37] the Earth's magnetic field the sky
[00:02:39] lights up with dazzling auroras but this
[00:02:42] space weather can cause problems too
[00:02:44] knocking out power grids electronics and
[00:02:46] communication systems the hope is the
[00:02:49] mission can help us to better understand
[00:02:51] this but first the spacecraft has to
[00:02:53] survive its burning hot flyby I will
[00:02:56] worry but we really have designed that
[00:02:58] spacecraft to withstand uh all all of
[00:03:01] these uh brutal brutal conditions it's a
[00:03:04] tough tough little
[00:03:06] spacecraft during this close approach
[00:03:08] the spacecraft is out of communication
[00:03:10] for several days so the NASA team face a
[00:03:13] nervous wait over Christmas before they
[00:03:16] can finally discover the secrets of our
[00:03:18] star Rebecca Morell BBC
[00:03:21] News my goodness extraordinary story
[00:03:24] what a Christmas president if that all
[00:03:25] works let's talk to Dr Jennifer Millard
[00:03:27] astronomer and managing editor at
[00:03:29] software company fifth STAR labs and
[00:03:32] just explain to us the conditions that
[00:03:35] this little probe has to get
[00:03:37] through it's extraordinary what this
[00:03:40] probe has to survive you know we're
[00:03:42] talking temperatures of well over a
[00:03:43] thousand degrees it is being blasted by
[00:03:46] radiation from The Sun Also particles
[00:03:49] from the sun it's being bombarded by
[00:03:51] dust as well Cosmic dust it's really the
[00:03:55] most extreme environment we have ever
[00:03:57] sent a spacecraft to but it is is well
[00:04:00] prepared it's got its Shield it's got
[00:04:02] its cooling system so it should survive
[00:04:05] and it should it survive fingers crossed
[00:04:07] it should survive what kind of
[00:04:09] information do we hope it will bring
[00:04:11] back this prob is going to tell us about
[00:04:14] the sun's magnetic field in very close
[00:04:16] proximity to the Sun Path which we've
[00:04:18] never been able to explore before and
[00:04:20] the sun's magnetic field is so important
[00:04:22] for us to understand all of the planets
[00:04:25] of the solar system sit within the sun's
[00:04:27] magnetic field it influences is all of
[00:04:30] the planets you know life on Earth as
[00:04:32] well it's going to sample the solar wind
[00:04:35] so this constant stream of charged
[00:04:37] particles emanating from the surface of
[00:04:39] the sun we don't understand how the
[00:04:41] magnetic field of the sun is created we
[00:04:43] don't know where it comes from and we
[00:04:45] don't understand how these charged
[00:04:47] particles start almost stationary on the
[00:04:49] surface of the Sun and then they're
[00:04:51] accelerated to a million miles hour and
[00:04:55] we need to understand this because they
[00:04:57] make up space weather and space weather
[00:05:00] impacts our life on Earth not just with
[00:05:03] the beautiful northern lights or the
[00:05:04] Southern Lights the Aurora which we've
[00:05:06] enjoyed so much this year but also
[00:05:08] impacts our satellites a really strong
[00:05:10] solar storm when we have a big explosion
[00:05:13] of material on the surface of the Sun
[00:05:15] that barrels towards Earth well that can
[00:05:17] even knock out some of our satellites it
[00:05:19] can pose a danger to astronauts in space
[00:05:22] as well and we rely on you know
[00:05:24] satellites for not just studying space
[00:05:27] but it's looking at our planet it's
[00:05:29] monitoring weather natural disasters
[00:05:31] communication navigation with the GPS
[00:05:34] Network so understanding the Sun and how
[00:05:36] it works is absolutely vital for Modern
[00:05:39] Life and if we once we get that kind of
[00:05:42] understanding I mean obviously there's
[00:05:43] no controlling of these solar flares
[00:05:46] these winds but what will that
[00:05:48] information mean logically for us in
[00:05:50] terms of those satellites GPS and
[00:05:52] everything else you've described well it
[00:05:54] means we'll be able to make forecasts so
[00:05:57] like we can predict the weather on Earth
[00:05:58] it would be amazing and if we could
[00:06:00] forecast space weather and say okay we
[00:06:02] know that there's going to be a storm in
[00:06:04] 3 days which satellites might impact
[00:06:07] let's put them into safe mode maybe we
[00:06:09] can move their orbits move them out of
[00:06:11] the way we can get astronauts into more
[00:06:13] sheltered parts of space stations or if
[00:06:15] they're on deep space missions we can
[00:06:17] give them warning because you know we're
[00:06:19] moving into the era now of not just
[00:06:21] sending astronauts to the Moon which is
[00:06:23] what we're hoping to do with project
[00:06:24] emus but in the next couple of decades
[00:06:27] we're looking to send astronauts to Mars
[00:06:29] and on that sort of Journey you know
[00:06:30] you're eight months in space there is
[00:06:32] going to be a solar flare something is
[00:06:34] going to hit you and we need to give
[00:06:36] those astronauts as much warning as we
[00:06:38] can to make sure that they're protected
[00:06:40] so having that ability to predict these
[00:06:42] storms would be essential so a lot
[00:06:44] riding on this little probe no pressure
[00:06:47] there Dr Jennifer Millard astronomer and
[00:06:49] also uh from the fifth star lab software
[00:06:52] company thank you very much for talking
[00:06:53] us through it
