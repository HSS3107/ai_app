[00:00:01] hi Edie this is Ana P welcome to my home
[00:00:04] come on
[00:00:07] [Music]
[00:00:09] in there are like certain things that I
[00:00:12] would always see in my you know home
[00:00:13] with my parents and I'd be like oh if I
[00:00:15] lived alone I would do this if I lived
[00:00:16] alone I would do that it seems so silly
[00:00:18] and small but like I wanted to buy my
[00:00:20] own Cutlery and I wanted to host people
[00:00:22] a certain way and for me I think it's
[00:00:24] become it's like a symbol and a metaphor
[00:00:26] of me actually growing up and taking
[00:00:29] responsibility and
[00:00:32] adulting welcome to my living room come
[00:00:35] dining room come TV room it's all in
[00:00:40] one this is where I eat my breakfast and
[00:00:43] I read my newspaper in the
[00:00:46] morning how I like to host is I like
[00:00:49] just putting all the dinner on the table
[00:00:51] and then everyone can either sit on the
[00:00:52] table some people will sitting out on
[00:00:54] the floor I'm not really particular it's
[00:00:55] about I just want people to be
[00:00:56] comfortable
[00:01:00] this is where I spend all of my time and
[00:01:03] when I mean all of my time I mean all of
[00:01:05] my time I can sit on this couch for like
[00:01:08] 12 hours and not realize how time is
[00:01:10] passing because this window is always
[00:01:12] open and the breeze comes in and there's
[00:01:14] lots of natural
[00:01:15] light and I love this wallpaper a lot of
[00:01:19] people when they come home they think
[00:01:20] it's my handwriting on the wall but
[00:01:23] little secret it's not because my
[00:01:24] handwriting is terrible and this is very
[00:01:26] beautiful beautiful
[00:01:28] handwriting I love candles like my
[00:01:30] favorite thing to have in a home is
[00:01:32] candles and this one smells like
[00:01:34] cinnamon it's my Christmas
[00:01:38] candle this is where I watch
[00:01:41] TV I love this part because it has all
[00:01:44] of my books here my prized possessions
[00:01:48] my books I'm a huge collector of books I
[00:01:50] love
[00:01:51] [Music]
[00:01:52] reading so having Gori Khan do my house
[00:01:55] was very very very special to me because
[00:01:57] she's like family to me I've grown up
[00:01:59] around her and she just got it I
[00:02:01] couldn't have asked for anything better
[00:02:02] honestly feels like I had one
[00:02:04] conversation with her at the start and
[00:02:06] then I walked into a ready home and I
[00:02:07] was like this is perfect and having her
[00:02:10] do my first home is the most special
[00:02:12] thing that I could have asked
[00:02:15] for okay so here's a little secret when
[00:02:18] G Khan was making this house one big
[00:02:20] thing that she wanted to do was flush
[00:02:21] out all the doors to make the house seem
[00:02:23] better and here's my kitchen I've
[00:02:25] recently found a love for
[00:02:28] baking and now I house my
[00:02:33] it welcome
[00:02:37] in I love this room I think it's every
[00:02:39] little girl's dream to have you know a
[00:02:41] walk-in closet and because I'm an actor
[00:02:44] um it's a really efficient place to get
[00:02:46] ready and to have my whole team here and
[00:02:48] I love an open closet because when I was
[00:02:50] staying in my house with my parents my
[00:02:52] you know closet was a concealed closet
[00:02:54] and I couldn't really see a lot of my
[00:02:56] clothes so I wouldn't end up wearing a
[00:02:57] lot of them but I've kept an open closet
[00:02:59] and try to color coordinate it so I'm
[00:03:01] able to see everything I have at
[00:03:04] least and this is my huge makeup
[00:03:09] T and here I have some books and some
[00:03:13] candles uh and my first clap from um
[00:03:17] when I was shooting student of the year
[00:03:19] and Karan has written a sweet note on it
[00:03:21] so that's very special and I love having
[00:03:23] these sweet memorabilia is that the word
[00:03:25] in my house you know to make it feel
[00:03:27] like
[00:03:34] bye Edie thanks for coming home I hope
[00:03:36] you liked it
