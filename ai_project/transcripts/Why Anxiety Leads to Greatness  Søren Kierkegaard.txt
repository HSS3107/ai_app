[00:00:05] Surin kirkgard born in Copenhagen in
[00:00:08] 1813 is often remembered as the father
[00:00:11] of existentialism a philosopher and
[00:00:14] theologian whose profound insights into
[00:00:16] human existence have influenced
[00:00:18] Generations KAG guard's examination of
[00:00:21] the human psyche revealed a nuanced and
[00:00:23] multifaceted perspective on the emotion
[00:00:26] of anxiety rather than dismissing it as
[00:00:28] mere discomfort or a hurdle to happiness
[00:00:31] kirkgard invites us to rethink anxiety's
[00:00:33] role in our lives he talked about angst
[00:00:37] which is a deep kind of worry that hits
[00:00:39] us when we realize how many options we
[00:00:41] have in life and that we're the ones who
[00:00:43] have to choose according to kirkgard
[00:00:46] this angst wasn't something to shy away
[00:00:48] from he proposed that if we grasp
[00:00:51] anxiety's true nature and learn to
[00:00:53] channel it effectively it can become a
[00:00:55] powerful force for propelling us toward
[00:00:58] our ultimate potential so with that in
[00:01:00] mind in this video we'll explore how
[00:01:03] saurin kirkgard guides us to harness the
[00:01:05] power of
[00:01:07] anxiety anxiety is the dizziness of
[00:01:10] Freedom Sur kirkgard believed that
[00:01:13] anxiety is something we feel because we
[00:01:15] have the freedom to make our own choices
[00:01:18] he believed that when we realize we can
[00:01:20] decide what to do in life it can make us
[00:01:22] feel nervous or worried imagine you're
[00:01:25] in a library filled with an endless
[00:01:27] number of books each book is a different
[00:01:29] life could live a different choice you
[00:01:31] could make that's the kind of Freedom we
[00:01:33] have it's thrilling but also a bit
[00:01:36] overwhelming kirkgard believe that
[00:01:38] within this dizziness lies the essence
[00:01:41] of our anxiety it is the feeling we get
[00:01:43] when we fully comprehend the weight of
[00:01:46] our freedom to carve out our future with
[00:01:48] the choices we make with this Freedom
[00:01:50] comes a significant
[00:01:52] responsibility each decision carries
[00:01:54] consequences and the knowledge that we
[00:01:56] are The Architects of our own lives can
[00:01:58] be as daunting as it is imp EMP powering
[00:02:00] if we opt to step back from making
[00:02:02] choices we let go of the control we have
[00:02:05] over our life's Direction yet when we
[00:02:08] act and make a decision we exercise our
[00:02:10] freedom and simultaneously acknowledge
[00:02:13] the responsibility that accompanies our
[00:02:16] actions Whoever has learned to be
[00:02:18] anxious in the right way has learned the
[00:02:21] ultimate at the heart of our freedom
[00:02:23] lies a profound Paradox on one side
[00:02:27] having so many choices can feel like a
[00:02:29] heavy burden the weight of
[00:02:31] responsibility can Loom large a reminder
[00:02:34] of the repercussions each potential path
[00:02:36] holds and often it is this very weight
[00:02:40] that can paradoxically bring us Comfort
[00:02:42] when decisions are made for us on the
[00:02:44] other hand there is the act of embracing
[00:02:47] our decision-making power kirkgard
[00:02:50] acknowledged the anxiety that
[00:02:51] accompanies this freedom however he
[00:02:54] believed that it is only through making
[00:02:56] decisions that we truly engage with life
[00:02:58] and it is through these choices that we
[00:03:00] affirm our existence and embrace the
[00:03:03] full experience of being alive to
[00:03:06] acknowledge this form of anxiety is to
[00:03:08] recognize a fundamental truth about
[00:03:10] human nature we are free beings and this
[00:03:14] recognition is not the end but the
[00:03:17] beginning a starting point towards
[00:03:19] something greater it is the first step
[00:03:21] toward using our innate Freedom not just
[00:03:24] to exist but to thrive it is in this
[00:03:27] understanding that we can start to
[00:03:29] harness the true potential of our
[00:03:30] anxiety when we feel that dizzying
[00:03:33] sensation of Freedom it's a signal to
[00:03:35] pause and consider what we're about to
[00:03:37] do it's a moment right for reflection
[00:03:40] asking ourselves whether the choices
[00:03:42] we're making align with our deepest
[00:03:44] values and goals at this moment as we
[00:03:47] ready ourselves to face the vast unknown
[00:03:50] there's one crucial element that Sur and
[00:03:53] kir KAG guard emphasized as essential
[00:03:55] and that's the unwavering faith in
[00:03:58] ourselves
[00:04:00] faith is the highest passion in a human
[00:04:02] being many in every generation may not
[00:04:05] come that far but none comes further
[00:04:08] kirkgard isn't talking about faith in a
[00:04:11] purely religious sense but rather as a
[00:04:13] concept that encompasses trust
[00:04:15] conviction and the courage to confront
[00:04:17] the unknown he introduced the metaphor
[00:04:20] of the leap of faith which is about more
[00:04:22] than just belief it's about action it's
[00:04:26] like standing before a thick fog the
[00:04:29] path ahead obscured with only the Solid
[00:04:31] Ground of your past experiences to rely
[00:04:33] on to embrace a leap of faith is to step
[00:04:37] forward not moved by certainty but by
[00:04:40] confidence in oneself this doesn't mean
[00:04:43] jumping blindly or recklessly but rather
[00:04:45] trusting in what can't be seen and in
[00:04:48] our own capacity to endure and adapt it
[00:04:52] means deciding to venture into a new
[00:04:55] experience without guarantees yet with
[00:04:58] the belief that somewhere within the the
[00:04:59] Mist lies an opportunity for growth and
[00:05:03] Discovery but before we even think about
[00:05:05] making that leap kirkgard invites us to
[00:05:08] look at how we're living dayto day are
[00:05:10] we living authentically Authentic Living
[00:05:13] is about embracing who we truly are
[00:05:16] understanding our own values and beliefs
[00:05:18] and making choices that resonate deeply
[00:05:20] with our true selves it's a way of being
[00:05:23] that acknowledges our personal desires
[00:05:25] and dreams even when they don't align
[00:05:28] with the expectations set by others or
[00:05:30] Society at large in these moments
[00:05:33] anxiety often arises when we're on the
[00:05:35] cusp of the unknown the unknown can be
[00:05:38] anything a new job a move to a different
[00:05:41] city or any significant change that
[00:05:43] forces us out of our comfort zone it's
[00:05:46] the kind of situation where there are no
[00:05:48] guarantees and the outcome is uncertain
[00:05:51] here's where kirkgard sees the value in
[00:05:53] our anxiety viewing it not as a barrier
[00:05:56] but as a vital part of the journey
[00:05:58] towards an authentic life
[00:06:00] and as we learn to coexist with anxiety
[00:06:02] we often discover aspects of ourselves
[00:06:05] we never knew existed we might unearth a
[00:06:08] well of Courage when faced with life's
[00:06:10] uncertainties or a hidden reservoir of
[00:06:13] patience as we navigate through
[00:06:15] ambiguity this process of self-discovery
[00:06:18] can be both humbling and empowering we
[00:06:20] come to understand our strengths and
[00:06:22] limitations more deeply which in turn
[00:06:25] equips us to make more authentic choices
[00:06:27] in the future kir
[00:06:30] understood that it's through embracing
[00:06:31] the unknown and the anxiety that comes
[00:06:34] with it that we grow and that personal
[00:06:36] growth isn't a straight path but a
[00:06:39] winding Journey filled with obstacles
[00:06:41] and challenges and anxiety isn't just a
[00:06:44] challenge it's a signpost signaling that
[00:06:47] we're stretching our limits and
[00:06:49] venturing beyond what we once thought
[00:06:51] possible as kirkgard once
[00:06:54] wrote to DARE is to lose one's footing
[00:06:57] momentarily not to dare is to lose
[00:07:01] oneself in this quote KAG guard
[00:07:03] encourages us to take a closer look at
[00:07:06] the link between taking risks and our
[00:07:08] personal identity He suggests that
[00:07:11] taking a risk May momentarily throw us
[00:07:13] off balance it's like the first
[00:07:16] uncertain step into unfamiliar territory
[00:07:19] our heartbeat quickens and there's a
[00:07:21] brief feeling of instability we may not
[00:07:24] be certain of our next step but there's
[00:07:26] an exhilarating sense of adventure in
[00:07:28] cont
[00:07:30] if we shy away from Taking Chances and
[00:07:32] choose not to DARE we risk a much more
[00:07:35] significant and enduring type of loss
[00:07:38] it's the loss of our potential of the
[00:07:40] person we could become if only we
[00:07:42] stepped out of our comfort zone
[00:07:44] according to kirkgard not daring doesn't
[00:07:47] just mean standing still it means losing
[00:07:49] a part of ourselves that only the act of
[00:07:52] Daring can reveal this loss of potential
[00:07:55] is intricately linked to the anxiety we
[00:07:57] often feel when faced with the unknown
[00:08:00] rather than viewing anxiety as an enemy
[00:08:03] kirkgard believed it could become an
[00:08:05] ally in our self-discovery and
[00:08:07] decision-making processes think about
[00:08:09] the important times when you're facing a
[00:08:11] big decision do you go the safe familiar
[00:08:14] route you've always taken or Venture
[00:08:16] Down A New Path that's full of potential
[00:08:19] but also
[00:08:20] uncertainty it's precisely in these
[00:08:22] times that anxiety can serve as a
[00:08:25] catalyst honing our awareness and
[00:08:27] guiding us to deliberate more carefully
[00:08:29] about our next step instead of allowing
[00:08:32] anxiety to paralyze us we can Channel it
[00:08:35] to propel us into decisive action
[00:08:37] potentially leading to richer
[00:08:39] experiences and deeper self- knowledge
[00:08:42] it's crucial to introspect to grasp the
[00:08:45] origins of our emotions and to let our
[00:08:47] discoveries inform our actions kirkgard
[00:08:50] expressed this when he
[00:08:52] remarked life can only be understood
[00:08:55] backwards but it must be lived
[00:08:57] forwards by reflecting on our past we
[00:09:00] gain insight into our previous actions
[00:09:02] and choices which sets the foundation
[00:09:05] for making better decisions as we
[00:09:07] advance in life in this way anxiety can
[00:09:10] become a motivator spurring us on to
[00:09:13] chase our passions with more intensity
[00:09:15] it is this mix of eagerness and worry
[00:09:18] that fuels our drive propelling us
[00:09:21] forward like a powerful current that
[00:09:23] carries us toward our
[00:09:25] destination kirkgard understood that the
[00:09:28] road to fulfillment
[00:09:29] is often paved with moments of
[00:09:31] uncertainty which when approached with
[00:09:33] courage can lead to self-expansion and
[00:09:36] profound
[00:09:37] accomplishment when we are self-aware
[00:09:39] and mindful anxiety becomes an indicator
[00:09:43] of imminent growth and a companion on
[00:09:45] the path to reaching our full potential
[00:09:48] and each time we feel anxious that
[00:09:50] reminds us that we are in constant
[00:09:52] motion forever pursuing the embodiment
[00:09:55] of our greatest
[00:09:58] selves
