[00:05:59] the candidates to the stage vice
[00:06:00] president KLA Harris and president
[00:06:02] Donald
[00:06:09] Trump KLA Harris Let's Have a good
[00:06:12] debate see you have fun thank
[00:06:14] you welcome to you both it's wonderful
[00:06:17] to have you it's an honor to have you
[00:06:18] both here tonight good evening we are
[00:06:20] looking forward to a spirited and
[00:06:22] thoughtful debate so let's get started I
[00:06:24] want to begin tonight with the issue
[00:06:26] that voters repeatedly say is their
[00:06:27] number one issue and that is the economy
[00:06:29] and the cost of living in this country
[00:06:31] vice president Harris you and president
[00:06:33] Trump were elected four years ago and
[00:06:35] your opponent on the stage here tonight
[00:06:37] often asks his supporters are you better
[00:06:39] off than you were four years ago when it
[00:06:41] comes to the economy do you believe
[00:06:43] Americans are better off than they were
[00:06:45] four years ago so I was raised as a
[00:06:49] middle class kid and I am actually the
[00:06:51] only person on this stage who has a plan
[00:06:54] that is about lifting up the middle
[00:06:56] class and working people of America I
[00:06:58] believe in the Ambitions the aspirations
[00:07:01] the dreams of the American people and
[00:07:03] that is why I imagine and have actually
[00:07:06] a plan to build what I call an
[00:07:08] opportunity economy because here's the
[00:07:10] thing we know that we have a a shortage
[00:07:13] of of homes and housing and the cost of
[00:07:15] housing is too expensive for far too
[00:07:17] many people we know that young families
[00:07:20] need support to raise their children and
[00:07:23] I intend on extending a tax cut for
[00:07:26] those families of $6,000 which is the
[00:07:28] largest child tax credit that we have
[00:07:31] given in a long time so that those young
[00:07:33] families can afford to buy a crib buy a
[00:07:36] car seat buy clothes for their children
[00:07:39] my passion one of them is small
[00:07:42] businesses I was actually my mother
[00:07:44] raised my sister and me but there was a
[00:07:46] woman who helped raise us we call her
[00:07:48] our second mother she was a small
[00:07:49] business owner I love our small
[00:07:51] businesses my plan is to give a
[00:07:54] $50,000 tax deduction to Startup small
[00:07:57] businesses knowing they are part part of
[00:07:59] the backbone of America's economy my
[00:08:02] opponent on the other hand his plan is
[00:08:04] to do what he has done before which is
[00:08:07] to provide a tax cut for billionaires
[00:08:09] and big corporations which will result
[00:08:12] in$ trillion dollar to America's deficit
[00:08:15] my opponent has a plan that I call the
[00:08:17] Trump's sales tax which would be a 20%
[00:08:20] tax on everyday Goods that you rely on
[00:08:23] to get through the month economists have
[00:08:26] said that that Trump sales tax would
[00:08:29] actually result for middle class
[00:08:31] families in about $4,000 more a year
[00:08:35] because of his policies and his ideas
[00:08:38] about what should be the backs of middle
[00:08:41] class people paying for tax cuts for
[00:08:44] billionaires president Trump I'll give
[00:08:46] you two minutes first of all I have no
[00:08:48] sales tax that's an incorrect statement
[00:08:50] she knows that uh we're doing tariffs on
[00:08:52] other countries other countries are
[00:08:54] going to finally after 75 years pay us
[00:08:57] back for all that we've done for the
[00:08:59] world
[00:09:00] and the Tariff will be substantial in
[00:09:02] some cases I took in billions and
[00:09:04] billions of dollars as you know from
[00:09:06] China in fact they never took the Tariff
[00:09:08] off because it was so much money they
[00:09:09] can't it would totally destroy
[00:09:11] everything that they've set out to do
[00:09:13] they're taking in billions of dollars
[00:09:15] from China and other places they've left
[00:09:17] the tariffs on when I had it I had
[00:09:19] tariffs and yet I had no inflation uh
[00:09:21] look we've had a terrible economy
[00:09:24] because inflation has which is really
[00:09:26] known as a country Buster it breaks up
[00:09:28] countries we have inflation like very
[00:09:30] few people have ever seen before
[00:09:32] probably the worst in our nation's
[00:09:34] history we were at 21% but that's being
[00:09:37] generous because many things are 50 60
[00:09:40] 70 and 80% higher than they were just a
[00:09:42] few years ago this has been a disaster
[00:09:45] for people for the middle class but for
[00:09:47] every class on top of that we have
[00:09:49] millions of people pouring into our
[00:09:51] country from prisons and jails from
[00:09:53] mental institutions and insane asylums
[00:09:56] and they're coming in and they're taking
[00:09:59] jobs that are occupied right now by
[00:10:01] African-Americans and Hispanics and also
[00:10:04] unions unions are going to be affected
[00:10:06] very soon and you see what's happening
[00:10:08] you see what's happening with towns
[00:10:09] throughout the United States you look at
[00:10:11] Springfield Ohio you look at Aurora in
[00:10:14] Colorado they are taking over the towns
[00:10:17] they're taking over buildings they're
[00:10:19] going in violently these are the people
[00:10:22] that she and Biden led into our country
[00:10:25] and they're destroying our country
[00:10:27] they're dangerous they're at the highest
[00:10:29] EST level of criminality and we have to
[00:10:31] get them out we have to get them out
[00:10:33] fast I created one of the greatest
[00:10:35] economies in the history of our country
[00:10:38] I'll do it again and even better we are
[00:10:40] going to get to immigration and border
[00:10:41] security during this debate but uh I
[00:10:43] would like to let vice president Harris
[00:10:45] respond on the economy here well I would
[00:10:47] love to let's talk about what Donald
[00:10:50] Trump left us Donald Trump left us the
[00:10:54] worst unemployment since the Great
[00:10:57] Depression Donald Trump left us us the
[00:10:59] worst Public Health epidemic in a
[00:11:03] century Donald Trump left us the worst
[00:11:07] attack on our democracy since the Civil
[00:11:11] War and what we have done is clean up
[00:11:14] Donald Trump's mess what we have done
[00:11:16] and what I intend to do is build on what
[00:11:19] we know are the aspirations and the
[00:11:21] hopes of the American people but I'm
[00:11:22] going to tell youall in this debate
[00:11:23] tonight you're going to hear from the
[00:11:26] same old tired Playbook a bunch of Lies
[00:11:29] Grievances and name calling what you're
[00:11:32] going to hear tonight is a detailed and
[00:11:35] dangerous Plan called project 2025 that
[00:11:38] the former president intends on
[00:11:40] implementing if he were elected to again
[00:11:43] I believe very strongly that the
[00:11:45] American people want a president who
[00:11:48] understands the importance of bringing
[00:11:50] us together know we have so much more in
[00:11:52] common than what separates us and I
[00:11:54] pledge to you to be a president for all
[00:11:56] Americans president Trump I'll give you
[00:11:58] a minute here to respond number one I
[00:11:59] have nothing to do as you know and as
[00:12:01] she knows better than anyone I have
[00:12:02] nothing to do with project 2025 uh
[00:12:05] that's out there I haven't read it I
[00:12:07] don't want to read it purposely I'm not
[00:12:09] going to read it this was a group of
[00:12:11] people that got together they came up
[00:12:12] with some ideas I guess some good some
[00:12:14] bad but it makes no difference I have
[00:12:16] nothing to do everybody knows I'm an
[00:12:18] open book everybody knows what I'm going
[00:12:19] to do cut taxes very substantially and
[00:12:22] create a great economy like I did before
[00:12:25] we had the greatest economy we got hit
[00:12:27] with a pandemic and the pandemic was is
[00:12:29] not since 19177 where 100 million people
[00:12:32] died has there been anything like it we
[00:12:34] did a phenomenal job with the pandemic
[00:12:37] we handed them over a country where the
[00:12:40] economy and where the stock market was
[00:12:42] higher than it was before the pandemic
[00:12:44] came in nobody's ever seen anything like
[00:12:46] it we made ventilators for the entire
[00:12:49] world we got gowns we got masks we did
[00:12:51] things that nobody thought possible and
[00:12:54] people give me credit for rebuilding the
[00:12:55] military they give me credit for a lot
[00:12:57] of things but not enough credit for the
[00:12:59] great job we did with the pandemic but
[00:13:01] the only jobs they got were bounceback
[00:13:03] jobs these were jobs bounceback and it
[00:13:05] bounced back and it went to their
[00:13:07] benefit but I was the one that created
[00:13:09] them they know it and so does everybody
[00:13:11] else vice president Harris I'll let you
[00:13:13] respond
[00:13:14] so Donald Trump has no plan for you and
[00:13:18] when you look at his economic plan it's
[00:13:20] all about tax breaks for the richest
[00:13:22] people I am offering what I describe as
[00:13:26] an opportunity economy and the best econ
[00:13:29] economists in our country if not the
[00:13:30] world have reviewed our relative plans
[00:13:33] for the future of America what Goldman
[00:13:36] Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's
[00:13:39] plan would make the economy worse mine
[00:13:41] would strengthen the economy what the
[00:13:44] Wharton School has said is Donald
[00:13:45] Trump's plan would actually explode the
[00:13:49] deficit 16 Nobel laurates have described
[00:13:53] his economic plan as something that
[00:13:55] would increase inflation and by the
[00:13:57] middle of next year would invite a
[00:14:00] recession you just have to look at where
[00:14:03] we are and where we stand on the issues
[00:14:05] and I'd invite you to know that Donald
[00:14:07] Trump actually has no plan for you
[00:14:10] because he is more interested in
[00:14:11] defending himself than he is in looking
[00:14:13] out for you that's just a sound by they
[00:14:16] gave her that to say look I went to the
[00:14:18] Wharton School of finance and many of
[00:14:20] those professors the top professors
[00:14:22] think my plan is a brilliant plan it's a
[00:14:24] great plan it's a plan that's going to
[00:14:26] bring up our our worth our value as a
[00:14:29] country it's going to make people want
[00:14:30] to be able to go and work and uh create
[00:14:33] jobs and create a lot of good solid
[00:14:36] money for our for our country and just
[00:14:38] to finish off uh she doesn't have a plan
[00:14:42] she copied Biden's plan and it's like
[00:14:45] four sentences like Run Spot Run four
[00:14:49] sentences that are just oh we'll try and
[00:14:51] lower taxes she doesn't have a plan take
[00:14:54] a look at her plan she doesn't have a
[00:14:55] plan Mr President I do want to drill
[00:14:58] down on something you both brought up uh
[00:14:59] the vice president brought up uh your
[00:15:01] tariffs you responded and let's drill
[00:15:03] down on this because your plan is what
[00:15:05] she calls is essentially a national
[00:15:07] sales tax your proposal calls for
[00:15:08] tariffs as you pointed out here on
[00:15:10] Foreign imports across the board you
[00:15:12] recently said that you might double your
[00:15:13] plan imposing tariffs up to 20% on Goods
[00:15:16] coming into this country as you know
[00:15:18] many economists say that with tariffs at
[00:15:20] that level costs are then passed on to
[00:15:22] the consumer vice president Harris has
[00:15:24] argued it'll mean higher prices on gas
[00:15:26] food clothing medication argu it cost
[00:15:29] the typical family nearly $4,000 a year
[00:15:32] do you believe Americans can afford
[00:15:34] higher prices because of tariffs they're
[00:15:36] not going to have higher prices what's
[00:15:37] going to have and who's going to have
[00:15:38] higher prices is China and all of the
[00:15:41] countries that have been ripping us off
[00:15:43] for years I charged I was the only
[00:15:45] president ever China was paying us
[00:15:48] hundreds of billions of dollars and so
[00:15:50] were other countries and you know if she
[00:15:52] doesn't like them they should have gone
[00:15:53] out and they should have immediately cut
[00:15:55] the tariffs but those tariffs are there
[00:15:57] three and a half years now under their
[00:15:59] Administration we are going to take in
[00:16:02] billions of dollars hundreds of billions
[00:16:04] of dollars I had no inflation virtually
[00:16:07] no inflation they had the highest
[00:16:09] inflation perhaps in the history of our
[00:16:11] country because I've never seen a worse
[00:16:13] period of time people can't go out and
[00:16:15] buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything
[00:16:18] else these the people of our country are
[00:16:21] absolutely dying with what they've done
[00:16:24] they've destroyed the economy and all
[00:16:26] you have to do is look at a poll the
[00:16:28] polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that
[00:16:31] the Trump economy was great that their
[00:16:34] economy was terrible vice president
[00:16:36] Harris I do want to ask for your
[00:16:37] response and you heard what the
[00:16:38] president said there because the Biden
[00:16:39] Administration did keep a number of the
[00:16:42] Trump tariffs in place so how do you
[00:16:43] respond well let's be clear that the
[00:16:46] Trump Administration resulted in a trade
[00:16:48] deficit one of the highest we've ever
[00:16:50] seen in the history of America he
[00:16:53] invited trade Wars you want to talk
[00:16:55] about his deal with China what he ended
[00:16:58] up doing is under Donald Trump's
[00:17:00] presidency he ended up selling American
[00:17:03] chips to China to help them improve and
[00:17:07] modernize their military basically sold
[00:17:10] us out when a policy about China should
[00:17:13] be in making sure the United States of
[00:17:15] America wins the competition for the
[00:17:17] 21st century which means focusing on the
[00:17:21] details of what that requires focusing
[00:17:23] on relationships with our allies
[00:17:25] focusing on investing in american-based
[00:17:27] technology so that we win the race on AI
[00:17:31] on Quantum Computing focusing on what we
[00:17:34] need to do to support America's
[00:17:36] Workforce so that we don't end up having
[00:17:39] the on the short end of the stick in
[00:17:41] terms of workers rights but what Donald
[00:17:44] Trump did let's talk about this with
[00:17:46] covid is he actually thanked president
[00:17:49] XI for what he did during Co look at his
[00:17:52] tweet thank you president XI exclamation
[00:17:55] point when we know that she was
[00:17:58] responsible for lacking and not giving
[00:18:01] us transparency about the origins of
[00:18:04] covid President Trump I'll let you
[00:18:05] respond first of all they bought their
[00:18:07] chips from Taiwan we hardly make chips
[00:18:10] anymore because of uh philosophies like
[00:18:12] they have and policies like they have I
[00:18:15] don't say her because she has no policy
[00:18:17] everything that she believed three years
[00:18:20] ago and four years ago is out the window
[00:18:22] she's going to My Philosophy now in fact
[00:18:24] I was going to send her a Maga hat she's
[00:18:26] gone to My Philosophy but if she ever
[00:18:29] got elected she'd change it and it will
[00:18:31] be the end of our country she's a
[00:18:33] Marxist everybody knows she's a Marxist
[00:18:36] her father's a Marxist professor in
[00:18:38] economics and he taught her well but
[00:18:41] when you look at what she's done to our
[00:18:43] country and when you look at these
[00:18:45] millions and millions of people that are
[00:18:47] pouring into our country monthly where
[00:18:49] it's I believe 21 million people not the
[00:18:51] 15 that people say and I think it's a
[00:18:53] lot higher than the 21 that's bigger
[00:18:56] than New York State pouring in and just
[00:18:58] look at what they're doing to our
[00:18:59] country they're criminals many of these
[00:19:02] people coming in are criminals and
[00:19:03] that's bad for our economy too you know
[00:19:05] you mentioned before we'll talk about
[00:19:07] immigration later well bad immigration
[00:19:09] is the worst thing that can happen to
[00:19:11] our economy they have and she has
[00:19:15] destroyed our country with policy that's
[00:19:18] insane almost policy that you'd say they
[00:19:21] have to hate our country president Trump
[00:19:23] thank you Lindsay I want to turn to the
[00:19:25] issue of abortion president Trump you've
[00:19:27] often touted that you were able to to
[00:19:28] kill roie Wade last year you said that
[00:19:31] you were proud to be the most pro-life
[00:19:34] president in American history then last
[00:19:36] month you said that your Administration
[00:19:38] would be great for women and their
[00:19:39] Reproductive Rights in your home state
[00:19:41] of Florida you surprised many uh with
[00:19:44] regard to your six week abortion ban
[00:19:45] because you initially had said that it
[00:19:47] was too short and you said quote I'm
[00:19:49] going to be voting that we need more
[00:19:51] than six weeks but then the very next
[00:19:53] day you reversed course and said you
[00:19:55] would vote to support the six- we ban
[00:19:58] vice president Harris says that women
[00:19:59] shouldn't trust you on the issue of of
[00:20:02] abortion because you've changed your
[00:20:04] position so many times therefore why
[00:20:06] should they trust you well the reason
[00:20:08] I'm doing that vote is because the plan
[00:20:10] is as you know the vote is they have
[00:20:13] abortion in the 9th month they even have
[00:20:16] and you can look at the governor of West
[00:20:17] Virginia the previous governor of West
[00:20:19] Virginia not the current governor is
[00:20:21] doing an excellent job but the governor
[00:20:23] before he said the baby will be born and
[00:20:27] we will decide what to do with the baby
[00:20:28] in other words we'll execute the baby
[00:20:30] and that's why I did that because that
[00:20:33] predominates because they're radical the
[00:20:35] Democrats are radical in that and her
[00:20:37] vice presidential pick which I think is
[00:20:40] a horrible pick by the way for our
[00:20:41] country because he is really out of it
[00:20:44] but her vice presidential pick says
[00:20:46] abortion in the ninth month is
[00:20:48] absolutely fine he also says execution
[00:20:52] after birth it's execution no longer
[00:20:54] abortion because the baby is born is
[00:20:57] okay and that's not okay with me hence
[00:20:59] the vote but what I did is something for
[00:21:02] 52 years they've been trying to get roie
[00:21:05] wade into the states and through the uh
[00:21:09] genius and and heart and strength of six
[00:21:14] Supreme Court Justices we were able to
[00:21:17] do that now I believe in the exceptions
[00:21:19] for rape incest and life of the mother I
[00:21:22] believe strongly in it Ronald Reagan did
[00:21:23] also 85% of Republicans do exceptions
[00:21:27] very important but we were able to get
[00:21:29] it and now states are voting on it and
[00:21:32] for the first time you're going to see
[00:21:34] look this is an issue that's torn our
[00:21:37] country apart for 52 years every legal
[00:21:41] scholar every Democrat every Republican
[00:21:44] liberal conservative they all wanted
[00:21:46] this issue to be brought back to the
[00:21:48] states where the people could vote and
[00:21:50] that's what happened happened now Ohio
[00:21:53] the vote was somewhat Liberal Kansas the
[00:21:56] vote was somewhat liberal much more
[00:21:57] liberal than people would have thought
[00:21:59] but each individual state is voting it's
[00:22:02] the vote of the people now it's not tied
[00:22:04] up in the federal government I did a
[00:22:06] great service in doing it it took
[00:22:07] courage to do it and the Supreme Court
[00:22:09] had great courage in doing it and I give
[00:22:12] tremendous credit to those six justices
[00:22:15] there is no state in this country where
[00:22:16] it is legal to kill a baby after it's
[00:22:18] born Madam vice president I want to get
[00:22:20] your response to president Trump well as
[00:22:22] I said you're going to hear a bunch of
[00:22:23] lies and that's not actually a
[00:22:25] surprising fact let's understand how how
[00:22:28] we got here Donald Trump hand selected
[00:22:32] three members of the United States
[00:22:34] Supreme Court with the intention that
[00:22:35] they would undo the protections of roie
[00:22:37] Wade and they did exactly as he intended
[00:22:41] and now in over 20 states there are
[00:22:44] Trump abortion bans which make it
[00:22:48] criminal for a doctor or nurse to
[00:22:51] provide Health Care in one state it
[00:22:53] provides prison for life Trump abortion
[00:22:56] bans that make no exception even for
[00:22:58] rape and incest which understand what
[00:23:00] that means a survivor of a crime of
[00:23:03] violation to their body does not have
[00:23:06] the right to make a decision about what
[00:23:08] happens to their body next that is
[00:23:11] immoral and one does not have to abandon
[00:23:14] their faith or deeply held beliefs to
[00:23:17] agree the government and Donald Trump
[00:23:20] certainly should not be telling a woman
[00:23:22] what to do with her body I have talked
[00:23:25] with women around our country you want
[00:23:28] to talk about this is what people wanted
[00:23:31] pregnant women who want to carry a
[00:23:34] pregnancy to term suffering from a
[00:23:36] miscarriage being denied care in an
[00:23:38] emergency room because the health care
[00:23:40] providers are afraid they might go to
[00:23:42] jail and she's bleeding out in a car in
[00:23:44] the parking lot she didn't want that her
[00:23:47] husband didn't want that a 12 or
[00:23:50] 13-year-old Survivor of incest being
[00:23:53] forced to carry a pregnancy to term they
[00:23:56] don't want that and and I pledge to you
[00:24:00] when Congress passes a bill to put back
[00:24:03] in place the protections of roie Wade as
[00:24:06] president of the United States I will
[00:24:07] proudly sign it into law but understand
[00:24:12] if Donald Trump were to be reelected he
[00:24:14] will sign a National Abortion ban
[00:24:17] understand in his project 2025 there
[00:24:19] would be a National Abortion a monitor
[00:24:22] that would be monitoring your
[00:24:23] pregnancies your miscarriages I think
[00:24:26] the American people believe that certain
[00:24:29] freedoms in particular the freedom to
[00:24:31] make decisions about one's own body
[00:24:34] should not be made by the government
[00:24:36] thank you vice president Harris well
[00:24:38] there she goes again it's a lie I'm not
[00:24:41] signing a ban and there's no reason to
[00:24:43] sign a ban because we've gotten what
[00:24:45] everybody wanted Democrats Republicans
[00:24:48] and everybody else and every legal
[00:24:51] scholar wanted it to be brought back
[00:24:53] into the states and the states are
[00:24:54] voting and it may take a little time but
[00:24:57] for 50 2 years this issue has torn our
[00:25:01] country apart and they've wanted it back
[00:25:04] in the States and I did something that
[00:25:06] nobody thought was possible the states
[00:25:08] are now voting what she says is an
[00:25:11] absolute lie and as far as the abortion
[00:25:14] B no I'm not in favor of abortion B but
[00:25:17] it doesn't matter because this issue has
[00:25:19] now been taken over by the states would
[00:25:21] you veto a National Abortion ban if it
[00:25:24] well I won't have to because again two
[00:25:26] things number one she said she'll go
[00:25:28] back to Congress she'll never get the
[00:25:29] vote there impossible for her to get the
[00:25:30] vote especially now with the 50/50 and
[00:25:34] essentially 50/50 in both Senate and the
[00:25:37] house she's not going to get the vote
[00:25:38] she can't get the vote she won't even
[00:25:40] come close to it so it's just talk you
[00:25:42] know what it reminds me of when they
[00:25:43] said they're going to get student loans
[00:25:45] terminated and it ended up being a total
[00:25:47] catastrophe the student loans and then
[00:25:50] her I I think probably her boss if you
[00:25:53] call him a boss he spends all his time
[00:25:54] on the beach but look her boss went out
[00:25:57] and said we'll do it again we'll do it a
[00:25:59] different way and he went out got
[00:26:01] rejected Again by the Supreme Court so
[00:26:03] all these students got taunted with this
[00:26:06] whole thing about this whole idea and
[00:26:08] how unfair that would have been part of
[00:26:10] the reason they lost to the millions and
[00:26:13] millions of people that had to pay off
[00:26:15] their student loans they didn't get it
[00:26:16] for free but they were saying it's the
[00:26:18] same way that they talked about that
[00:26:21] that they talk about abortion but if I
[00:26:22] could just get a yes or no because your
[00:26:24] running mate J JD Vance has said that
[00:26:27] you would veto if you did come to your
[00:26:28] desk well I didn't discuss it with JD in
[00:26:31] all fairness uh JD and I I don't mind if
[00:26:34] he has a certain view but I think he was
[00:26:36] speaking for me but I really didn't look
[00:26:39] we don't have to discuss it because
[00:26:41] she'd never be able to get it just like
[00:26:43] she couldn't get student loans they
[00:26:44] couldn't get student loans they didn't
[00:26:45] even come close to getting student loans
[00:26:47] they taunted young people and a lot of
[00:26:50] other people that had loans they can
[00:26:52] never get this approved so it doesn't
[00:26:54] matter what she says about going to
[00:26:55] Congress wonderful let's go to Congress
[00:26:57] do it but the fact is that for years
[00:26:59] they wanted to get it out of Congress
[00:27:01] and out of the federal government and we
[00:27:03] did something that everybody said
[00:27:04] couldn't be done and now you have a vote
[00:27:06] of the people on abortion vice president
[00:27:09] Harris want to give you your time to
[00:27:10] respond but I do want to ask would you
[00:27:12] support any restrictions on a woman's
[00:27:14] right to an abortion I absolutely
[00:27:16] support reinstating the protections of
[00:27:18] roie Wade and as you rightly mentioned
[00:27:22] nowhere in America is a woman carrying a
[00:27:26] pregnancy to term and and in asking for
[00:27:30] an abortion that is not happening it's
[00:27:32] insulting to the women of America and
[00:27:35] understand what has been happening under
[00:27:36] Donald Trump's abortion bans couples who
[00:27:40] pray and and and and dream of having a
[00:27:43] family are being denied IVF treatments
[00:27:47] what is happening in our country working
[00:27:50] people working women who are working one
[00:27:53] or two jobs who can barely afford child
[00:27:57] care as it is is have to travel to
[00:27:59] another state to get on a plane sitting
[00:28:03] next to strangers to go and get the
[00:28:05] health care she
[00:28:07] needs barely can afford to do it and
[00:28:10] what you are putting her through is
[00:28:13] unconscionable and the people of America
[00:28:16] have not the majority of Americans
[00:28:18] believe in a woman's right to make
[00:28:20] decisions about her own body and that is
[00:28:22] why in every state where this issue has
[00:28:25] been on the ballot in red and blue
[00:28:27] States boat
[00:28:28] the people of America have voted for
[00:28:30] Freedom vice president excuse me I have
[00:28:32] to respond another lie it's another lie
[00:28:35] I have been a leader on IVF which which
[00:28:38] is fertilization the IVF I have been a
[00:28:41] leader in fact when they got a very
[00:28:44] negative decision on IVF from the
[00:28:46] Alabama courts I saw the people of
[00:28:48] Alabama and the legislature two days
[00:28:51] later voted it in I've been a leader on
[00:28:54] it they know that and everybody else
[00:28:56] knows it I have been a leader on
[00:28:58] fertilization IVF and the other thing
[00:29:01] they not you should ask will she allow
[00:29:05] abortion in the eighth month ninth month
[00:29:07] seventh month come on okay would you do
[00:29:10] that why don't you ask her that question
[00:29:12] why don't you the question would because
[00:29:14] under roie way you could do abortions in
[00:29:18] the seventh month the eighth month the
[00:29:20] ninth month and probably after birth
[00:29:22] just look at the governor former
[00:29:24] governor of Virginia the governor of
[00:29:27] Virginia said we put the baby aside and
[00:29:29] then we determine what we want to do
[00:29:30] with the baby president Trump thank you
[00:29:32] we're going to turn now to immigration
[00:29:34] and border security we know it's an
[00:29:35] issue that's important to Republicans
[00:29:37] Democrats voters across the board uh in
[00:29:39] this country vice president Harris you
[00:29:41] were tasked by President Biden with
[00:29:43] getting to the root causes of migration
[00:29:44] from Central America we know that
[00:29:46] illegal border crossings reached a
[00:29:48] record high in the Biden Administration
[00:29:50] this past June President Biden imposed
[00:29:52] tough new Asylum restrictions we know
[00:29:54] the numbers since then have dropped
[00:29:56] significantly but my question to you
[00:29:58] tonight is why did the administration
[00:30:00] wait until 6 months before the election
[00:30:02] to act and would you have done anything
[00:30:04] differently from President Biden on this
[00:30:06] so I'm the only person on this stage who
[00:30:08] has prosecuted transnational criminal
[00:30:10] organizations for the trafficking of
[00:30:12] guns drugs and human beings and let me
[00:30:16] say that the United States Congress
[00:30:19] including some of the most conservative
[00:30:20] members of the United States Senate came
[00:30:22] up with a border security bill which I
[00:30:26] supported and that bill would have put
[00:30:28] 1,500 more border agents On the Border
[00:30:31] to help those folks who are working
[00:30:33] there right now overtime trying to do
[00:30:35] their job it would have allowed us to
[00:30:38] stem the flow of fentol coming into the
[00:30:41] United States I know there are so many
[00:30:43] families watching tonight who have been
[00:30:45] personally affected by The Surge of
[00:30:47] fentanyl in our country that bill would
[00:30:50] have put more resources to allow us to
[00:30:52] prosecute transnational criminal
[00:30:54] organizations for trafficking in guns
[00:30:56] drugs and human beings but you know what
[00:30:58] happened to that bill Donald Trump got
[00:31:00] on the phone called up some folks in
[00:31:03] Congress and said kill the bill and you
[00:31:05] know why because he'd prefer to run on a
[00:31:08] problem instead of fixing a problem and
[00:31:12] understand this comes at a time where
[00:31:15] the people of our country actually need
[00:31:17] a leader who engages in Solutions who
[00:31:21] actually addresses the problems at hand
[00:31:24] but what we have in the former president
[00:31:26] is someone who would prefer to run on a
[00:31:28] problem instead of fixing a problem and
[00:31:30] I'll tell you something he's going to
[00:31:32] talk about immigration a lot tonight
[00:31:33] even when it's not the subject that is
[00:31:34] being raised and I'm going to actually
[00:31:36] do something really unusual and I'm
[00:31:38] going to invite you to attend one of
[00:31:40] Donald Trump's rallies because it's a
[00:31:42] really interesting thing to watch you
[00:31:44] will see during the course of his
[00:31:46] rallies he talks about fictional
[00:31:47] characters like Hannibal Lecter he will
[00:31:50] talk about windmills caus cancer and
[00:31:53] what you will also notice is that people
[00:31:55] start leaving his rallies early out of
[00:31:57] EX exhaustion and boredom and I will
[00:32:00] tell you the one thing you will not hear
[00:32:01] him talk about is you you will not hear
[00:32:04] him talk about your needs your dreams
[00:32:06] and your need and your desires and I'll
[00:32:08] tell you I believe you deserve a
[00:32:11] president who actually puts you first
[00:32:13] and I pledge to you that I will vice
[00:32:15] president Harris thank you president
[00:32:16] Trump on that point I want to get your
[00:32:17] response like to respond let me just ask
[00:32:19] though why did you try to kill that bill
[00:32:21] and successfully so that would have put
[00:32:22] thousands of additional agents and
[00:32:24] officers On the Border first let me
[00:32:25] respond this to the rallies she said
[00:32:27] people start leaving people don't go to
[00:32:29] her rallies there's no reason to go and
[00:32:32] the people that do go she's busting them
[00:32:33] in and paying them to be there and then
[00:32:36] showing them in a different light so she
[00:32:39] can't talk about that people don't leave
[00:32:41] my rallies we have the biggest rallies
[00:32:42] the most incredible rallies in the
[00:32:44] history of politics that's because
[00:32:46] people want to take their country back
[00:32:48] our country is being lost we're a
[00:32:50] failing nation and it happened three and
[00:32:53] a half years ago and what what's going
[00:32:56] on here you're going to end up in world
[00:32:58] War I just to go into another subject
[00:33:00] what they have done to our country by
[00:33:02] allowing these millions and millions of
[00:33:04] people to come into our country and look
[00:33:06] at what's happening to the towns all
[00:33:08] over the United States and a lot of
[00:33:10] towns don't want to talk not going to be
[00:33:12] Aurora or Springfield a lot of towns
[00:33:14] don't want to talk about it because
[00:33:15] they're so embarrassed by it in
[00:33:17] Springfield they're eating the dogs the
[00:33:20] people that came in they're eating the
[00:33:22] cats they're eating they're eating the
[00:33:25] pets of the people that live there and
[00:33:29] this is what's happening in our country
[00:33:31] and it's a shame as far as rallies are
[00:33:34] concerned as far is the reason they go
[00:33:37] is they like what I say they want to
[00:33:39] bring our country back they want to make
[00:33:41] America great again it's very simple
[00:33:43] phrase make America great again she's
[00:33:46] destroying this country and if she
[00:33:48] becomes president this country doesn't
[00:33:50] have a chance of success not only
[00:33:52] success will end up being Venezuela on
[00:33:56] steroids I just want to clarify I hear
[00:33:58] you rig up Springfield Ohio and ABC News
[00:34:01] did reach out to the city manager there
[00:34:02] uh he told us there have been no
[00:34:04] credible reports of specific claims of
[00:34:06] pets being harmed injured or abused by
[00:34:08] individuals within the Immigrant
[00:34:10] Community I've seen people on television
[00:34:12] let me just say here this is the the
[00:34:13] people on television say my dog was
[00:34:15] taken and used for food so maybe he said
[00:34:18] that and maybe that's a good thing to
[00:34:19] say for a city manager I'm not taking
[00:34:21] this from people are television their
[00:34:23] dog was eaten by the people that went
[00:34:26] there again the Springfield City manager
[00:34:28] says there's no evidence of that vice
[00:34:30] president haris I'll let you respond to
[00:34:31] the rest of what you've heard you talk
[00:34:33] about
[00:34:35] extreme um you know I this is I think
[00:34:38] one of the reasons why in this election
[00:34:41] I actually have the endorsement of 200
[00:34:45] Republicans who have forly worked with
[00:34:48] President Bush Mitt Romney and John
[00:34:51] McCain including the endorsement of
[00:34:54] former Vice President Dick Cheney and
[00:34:56] congressmember
[00:34:58] Cheney and if you want to really know
[00:35:01] the inside track on who the former
[00:35:04] president is if he didn't make it clear
[00:35:05] already just ask people who have worked
[00:35:08] with him his former Chief of Staff a
[00:35:10] fourstar general has said he has
[00:35:12] contempt for the Constitution of the
[00:35:14] United States his former National
[00:35:16] Security adviser has said he is
[00:35:18] dangerous and unfit his former Secretary
[00:35:22] of Defense has said the nation the
[00:35:24] Republic would never survive another
[00:35:27] Trump
[00:35:28] term and when we listen to this kind of
[00:35:32] rhetoric when the issues that affect the
[00:35:35] American people are not being addressed
[00:35:38] I think the choice is clear in this
[00:35:39] election President Trump I'll give you a
[00:35:41] quick minute to respond here uh thank
[00:35:43] you because when I hear that see I'm a
[00:35:46] different kind of a person I fired most
[00:35:49] of those people not so graciously they
[00:35:51] did bad things or a bad job I fired them
[00:35:54] they never fired one person they didn't
[00:35:56] fire anybody having to do with
[00:35:58] Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13
[00:36:00] people who's who's were just killed
[00:36:03] viciously and violently killed and I got
[00:36:06] to know the parents and the family they
[00:36:08] didn't fire they should have fired all
[00:36:10] those generals all those top people
[00:36:12] because that was one of the most
[00:36:13] incompetently handled situations anybody
[00:36:16] has ever seen so when somebody does a
[00:36:19] bad job I fire them and you take a guy
[00:36:22] like esper he was no good I fired him so
[00:36:24] he writes a book another one writes a
[00:36:26] book because with me they can write
[00:36:27] books with nobody else can they but they
[00:36:30] have done such a poor job and they never
[00:36:33] fire anybody look at the economy look
[00:36:35] how look at the inflation they didn't
[00:36:37] fire any of their Economist they have
[00:36:39] the same people that's a good way not to
[00:36:42] have books written about you but just to
[00:36:44] finish I got more votes than any
[00:36:46] Republican in history by far in fact I
[00:36:51] got more votes than any president
[00:36:53] sitting president in history by
[00:36:56] far let me continue on immigration it
[00:36:58] was what you wanted to talk about
[00:36:59] earlier so let's get back to your
[00:37:00] deportation uh uh proposal that the vice
[00:37:04] president has reacted to as well
[00:37:06] president Trump you call this the
[00:37:07] largest domestic deportation operation
[00:37:09] in the history of our country you say
[00:37:11] you would use the National Guard you say
[00:37:12] if things get out of control you'd have
[00:37:14] no problem using the US military you
[00:37:16] also said you would use local police uh
[00:37:19] how would you uh Deport 11 million
[00:37:21] undocumented immigrants I know you you
[00:37:23] believe that number is much higher take
[00:37:25] us through this what does this look like
[00:37:27] will authorities be going door too in
[00:37:28] this country yeah it is much higher
[00:37:31] because of them they allowed criminals
[00:37:34] many many millions of criminals they
[00:37:36] allowed terrorists they allowed Common
[00:37:39] Street criminals they allowed people to
[00:37:41] come in drug dealers to come into our
[00:37:43] country and then now in the United
[00:37:44] States and told by their countries like
[00:37:48] Venezuela don't ever come back or we're
[00:37:50] going to kill you do you know that crime
[00:37:52] in Venezuela and crime in countries all
[00:37:55] over the world is way down down you know
[00:37:58] why because they've taken their
[00:38:00] criminals off the street and they've
[00:38:01] given them to her to put into our
[00:38:03] country and this will be one of the
[00:38:06] greatest mistakes in history for them to
[00:38:08] allow and I think they probably did it
[00:38:11] because they think they going to get
[00:38:12] votes but it's not worth it because
[00:38:14] they're they're destroying the fabric of
[00:38:16] our country by what they've done there's
[00:38:18] never been anything done like this at
[00:38:21] all they've destroyed the fabric of our
[00:38:23] country millions of people l in and all
[00:38:26] over the world crime is down all over
[00:38:29] the world except here crime here is up
[00:38:31] and through the roof despite their
[00:38:33] fraudulent statements that they made
[00:38:35] crime in this country is through the
[00:38:37] roof and we have a new form of crime
[00:38:39] it's called migrant crime and it's
[00:38:41] happening at levels that nobody thought
[00:38:42] possible president Trump as you know the
[00:38:44] FBI says overall violent crime is
[00:38:46] actually coming down to this country but
[00:38:48] exuse me the FBI defraud they were
[00:38:49] defrauding statements they they didn't
[00:38:52] include the worst cities they didn't
[00:38:54] include the cities with the worst crime
[00:38:56] it was a a fraud just like their number
[00:38:59] of
[00:38:59] 88,000 jobs that they said they created
[00:39:02] turned out to be a fraud president Trump
[00:39:03] thank you I'll let you respond vice
[00:39:04] president Harris well I think this is so
[00:39:06] rich coming from someone who has been
[00:39:10] prosecuted for National Security crimes
[00:39:14] economic crimes election interference
[00:39:18] has been found liable for sexual assault
[00:39:21] and his next big court appearance is in
[00:39:24] November at his own criminal sentencing
[00:39:27] and let's be clear where each person
[00:39:30] stands on the issue of what is important
[00:39:33] about respect for the rule of law and
[00:39:36] respect for law enforcement the former
[00:39:38] vice president called for defunding
[00:39:41] federal law enforcement
[00:39:43] 45,000 agents get this on the day after
[00:39:46] he was arraigned on 34 felony counts so
[00:39:50] let's talk about what is important in
[00:39:52] this race it is important that we move
[00:39:55] forward that we turn the page
[00:39:58] on this same old tired rhetoric and
[00:40:01] address the needs of the American people
[00:40:04] address what we need to do about the
[00:40:06] housing shortage which I have a plan for
[00:40:09] address what we must do to support our
[00:40:11] small businesses address Bringing Down
[00:40:14] the price of groceries but frankly the
[00:40:17] American people are exhausted with this
[00:40:19] same old tired Playbook vice president
[00:40:21] Harris thank you excuse me every one of
[00:40:24] those cases was started by them against
[00:40:27] their political opponent and I'm winning
[00:40:29] most of them and I will win the rest on
[00:40:31] appeal and you saw that with the
[00:40:32] decision that came down just recently
[00:40:34] from the Supreme Court I'm winning most
[00:40:36] of them but those are cases it's called
[00:40:38] weaponization never happened in this
[00:40:41] country they weaponized the justice
[00:40:43] department every one of those cases was
[00:40:45] involved with the doj from Atlanta and
[00:40:48] fny Willis to to the uh Attorney General
[00:40:52] of New York and the da of New York every
[00:40:54] one of those cases and then they say oh
[00:40:58] he was he's a criminal they're the ones
[00:41:00] that made them go after me by the way
[00:41:03] Joe Biden was found essentially guilty
[00:41:06] on the documents case and what happened
[00:41:08] in my documents case they said oh that's
[00:41:10] the toughest of them all a complete and
[00:41:12] total Victory two months ago it was
[00:41:14] thrown out it's weaponization and they
[00:41:18] used it and it's never happened in this
[00:41:19] country they used it to try and win an
[00:41:22] election fake cases president Trump
[00:41:24] thank you a really quick response here
[00:41:26] vice president Harris on this notion of
[00:41:27] weaponization of the justice department
[00:41:29] well let's talk about extreme and
[00:41:32] understand the context in which this
[00:41:33] election in 2024 is taking place the
[00:41:36] United States Supreme Court recently
[00:41:38] ruled that the former president would
[00:41:40] essentially be immune from any
[00:41:43] misconduct if he were to enter the White
[00:41:45] House again understand this is someone
[00:41:48] who has openly said he would terminate
[00:41:50] I'm quoting terminate the Constitution
[00:41:53] of the United States that he would
[00:41:55] weaponize the department of Justice
[00:41:57] against his political enemies someone
[00:42:01] who has openly expressed disdain for
[00:42:05] members of our military understand what
[00:42:08] it would mean if Donald Trump were back
[00:42:09] in the white house with no guard rails
[00:42:12] because certainly we know now the court
[00:42:14] won't stop him we know JD Vance is not
[00:42:16] going to stop him it's up to the
[00:42:18] American people vice president thank you
[00:42:21] Lindy vice president Harris in your last
[00:42:23] run for president weaponized please this
[00:42:26] is the one that weaponized not me she
[00:42:28] weaponized I probably took a bullet to
[00:42:31] the head because of the things that they
[00:42:33] say about me they talk about democracy
[00:42:36] I'm a threat to democracy they're the
[00:42:39] threat to democracy with a fake Russia
[00:42:41] Russia Russia investigation that went
[00:42:44] nowhere we have a lot to get to Lindsay
[00:42:45] vice president Harris in your last run
[00:42:47] for president you said you wanted to ban
[00:42:49] fracking now you don't you wanted
[00:42:51] mandatory government buyback programs
[00:42:53] for assault weapons now your campaign
[00:42:55] says you don't you supported
[00:42:57] criminalizing border crossings now
[00:42:59] you're taking a harder line I know you
[00:43:01] say that your values have not changed so
[00:43:03] then why have so many of your policy
[00:43:05] positions changed so my values have not
[00:43:08] changed and I'm going to discuss every
[00:43:10] one of the at least every point that
[00:43:12] you've made but in particular let's talk
[00:43:13] about fracking because we're here in
[00:43:14] Pennsylvania I made that very clear in
[00:43:16] 2020 I will not ban fracking I have not
[00:43:19] banned fracking as vice president the
[00:43:21] United States and in fact I Was the
[00:43:23] tiebreaking vote on the inflation
[00:43:25] reduction act which opened new leases
[00:43:28] for fracking my position is that we have
[00:43:32] got to invest in diverse sources of
[00:43:36] energy so we reduce our Reliance on
[00:43:38] foreign oil we have had the largest
[00:43:42] increase in domestic oil production in
[00:43:45] history because of an approach that
[00:43:47] recognizes that we cannot over rely on
[00:43:50] foreign oil as it relates to my values
[00:43:53] let me tell you I grew up a middle class
[00:43:55] kid raised by a hardwork mother who
[00:43:58] worked and saved and was able to buy our
[00:44:01] first home when I was a teenager the
[00:44:04] values I bring to the importance of home
[00:44:06] ownership knowing not everybody got
[00:44:08] handed $400 million on a silver platter
[00:44:11] and then filed bankruptcy six times is a
[00:44:14] value that I bring to my work to say we
[00:44:16] are going to work with the private
[00:44:18] sector and home builders to increase 3
[00:44:21] million homes increased by 3 million
[00:44:23] homes by the end of my first term my
[00:44:25] work that is related to having a friend
[00:44:28] when I was in high school who was
[00:44:30] sexually assaulted by her stepfather and
[00:44:32] my focus then on protecting women and
[00:44:35] children from violent crime is based on
[00:44:36] a value that is deeply grounded in the
[00:44:39] importance of standing up for those who
[00:44:41] are most vulnerable my work that is
[00:44:44] about protecting Social Security and
[00:44:46] Medicare is based on long-standing work
[00:44:49] that I have done protecting seniors from
[00:44:51] scams my values have not changed and
[00:44:56] what is important is is that there is a
[00:44:57] president who actually brings values and
[00:45:00] a perspective that is about lifting
[00:45:02] people up and not beating people down
[00:45:07] and name calling the true measure of the
[00:45:10] leader is the leader who actually
[00:45:13] understands the strength is not in
[00:45:15] beating people down it's in lifting
[00:45:17] people up I intend to be that president
[00:45:20] president Trump your well first of all I
[00:45:22] wasn't given $400 million I wish I was
[00:45:24] my father was a Brooklyn Builder
[00:45:26] Brooklyn Queens and a great father and I
[00:45:28] learned a lot from him but I was given a
[00:45:30] fraction of that a tiny fraction and I
[00:45:32] built it into many many billions of
[00:45:34] dollars many many billions and when
[00:45:36] people see it they are even surprised so
[00:45:39] we don't have to talk about that
[00:45:40] fracking she's been against it for 12
[00:45:42] years uh defund the police she's been
[00:45:46] against that forever she gave all that
[00:45:48] stuff up very wrongly very horribly and
[00:45:52] everybody's laughing at it okay they're
[00:45:54] all laughing at it she gave up at least
[00:45:57] 12 and probably 14 or 15 different
[00:45:59] policies like she was big on defund the
[00:46:02] police in Minnesota she went out wait a
[00:46:04] minute I'm talking now you don't mind
[00:46:07] please does that sound
[00:46:11] familiar she went
[00:46:13] out she went out in Minnesota and wanted
[00:46:17] to let criminals that killed people that
[00:46:19] burned down Minneapolis she went out and
[00:46:22] raised money to get him out of jail she
[00:46:24] did things that nobody would ever think
[00:46:26] of now now she wants to do transgender
[00:46:29] operations on illegal aliens that are in
[00:46:31] prison this is a radical left liberal
[00:46:35] that would do this she wants to
[00:46:36] confiscate your guns and she will never
[00:46:39] allow fracking in Pennsylvania if she
[00:46:41] won the election fracking in
[00:46:43] Pennsylvania will end on day one just to
[00:46:46] finish one thing so important in my
[00:46:48] opinion so I got the oil business going
[00:46:51] like nobody has ever done before they
[00:46:53] took when they took over they got rid of
[00:46:56] it started getting rid of it and the
[00:46:58] prices were going up the roof they
[00:47:01] immediately let these guys go to where
[00:47:04] they were I would have been five times
[00:47:07] four times five times higher because
[00:47:09] you're talking about three and a half
[00:47:10] years ago they got it up to where I was
[00:47:14] because they had no choice because the
[00:47:15] prices of energy were were quadrupling
[00:47:18] and doubling you saw what happened to
[00:47:19] gasoline so they said let's go back to
[00:47:21] Trump but if she won the election the
[00:47:24] day after that election they'll go back
[00:47:26] to destroying our country and oil will
[00:47:28] be dead fossil fuel will be dead we'll
[00:47:30] go back to windmills and we'll go back
[00:47:31] to solar where they need a whole desert
[00:47:34] to get some energy to come out you ever
[00:47:36] see a solar plant by the way I'm a big
[00:47:38] fan of solar but they
[00:47:40] take
[00:47:42] 4500 Acres of desert
[00:47:45] soil good things for the environment
[00:47:47] that she understand thank you Lindsay
[00:47:49] thank you we have an election in just 56
[00:47:51] days and and I want to talk about the
[00:47:53] peaceful transfer of power which of
[00:47:55] course we all know is a Cornerstone of
[00:47:57] our democracy and the role of a
[00:47:58] president uh in a moment of Crisis uh Mr
[00:48:01] President on January 6th you told your
[00:48:03] supporters to March to the capital you
[00:48:04] said you would be right there with them
[00:48:06] the country and the world saw what
[00:48:07] played out of the capital that day the
[00:48:09] officers coming under attack AIDS in the
[00:48:11] west wings say you watched it unfold on
[00:48:13] television off the Oval Office uh you
[00:48:15] did send out tweets but it was more than
[00:48:17] two hours before you sent out that video
[00:48:19] message uh telling your supporters to go
[00:48:21] home is there anything you regret about
[00:48:24] what you did on that day you just said a
[00:48:27] thing that isn't covered peacefully and
[00:48:30] patriotically I said during my speech
[00:48:32] not later on peacefully and
[00:48:36] patriotically and nobody on the other
[00:48:38] side was killed Ashley babot was shot by
[00:48:41] an outof control police officer that
[00:48:44] should have never ever shot her it's a
[00:48:47] disgrace but we didn't do this group of
[00:48:50] people that have been treated so badly I
[00:48:53] ask what about all the people that are
[00:48:54] pouring into our country and killing
[00:48:56] people that she allowed to port in she
[00:48:58] was the Bazar remember that she was the
[00:49:00] Bazar she doesn't want to be called the
[00:49:02] Bazar because she's embarrassed by the B
[00:49:04] fact she said at the beginning well I'm
[00:49:06] surprised you're not talking about the
[00:49:07] bdha yet that's because she knows what a
[00:49:10] bad job they've done what about those
[00:49:12] people what's what are they going to be
[00:49:14] prosecuted when are these people from
[00:49:16] countries all over the world not just
[00:49:18] South America they're coming in from all
[00:49:21] over the world David all over the world
[00:49:24] and crime rates are down all over the
[00:49:26] world because of it one of those David
[00:49:28] one of those people going to be
[00:49:30] prosecuted one of the people that burned
[00:49:32] down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted
[00:49:34] or in Seattle they went into Seattle
[00:49:36] they took over a big percentage of the
[00:49:38] city of Seattle when are those people
[00:49:40] going to be prosecuted but let me just
[00:49:42] ask you might ask her that question you
[00:49:43] were the president you were watching it
[00:49:45] unfold on television it's a very simple
[00:49:47] question as we move forward toward
[00:49:48] another election is there anything you
[00:49:50] regret about what you did on that day
[00:49:53] yes or I had nothing to do with that
[00:49:55] other than they asked me to make a
[00:49:56] speech I showed up for a speech I said I
[00:49:58] think it's going to be big I went to
[00:50:00] Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington
[00:50:03] DC and the mayor put it back in writing
[00:50:06] as you know I said you know this is
[00:50:08] going to be a very big Rally or whatever
[00:50:11] you want to call it and again it wasn't
[00:50:13] done by me it was done by others I said
[00:50:15] I'd like to give you 10,000 National
[00:50:17] Guard or soldiers they rejected me nany
[00:50:20] Pelosi rejected me it was just two weeks
[00:50:23] ago her daughter has a tape of her
[00:50:25] saying she is fully responsible for what
[00:50:27] happened they want to get rid of that
[00:50:29] tape it would have never happened if
[00:50:31] Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington
[00:50:34] did their jobs I wasn't responsible for
[00:50:36] security Nancy Pelosi was responsible
[00:50:39] she didn't do her job the question was
[00:50:41] about you as president not about former
[00:50:43] speaker Pelosi but I do want vice
[00:50:44] president Harris to respond
[00:50:46] here I was at the capital on January 6th
[00:50:50] I was the vice president elect I was
[00:50:53] also an acting Senator I was there and
[00:50:56] on that that day the president of the
[00:50:58] United States incited a violent
[00:51:01] mob to attack our nation's
[00:51:05] capital to desecrate our nation's
[00:51:08] capital on that day 140 law enforcement
[00:51:11] officers were injured and some died and
[00:51:15] understand the former president has been
[00:51:18] indicted and impeached for exactly that
[00:51:21] reason but this is not an isolated
[00:51:24] situation let's remember
[00:51:27] Charlottesville where there was a mob of
[00:51:30] people carrying tiki torches spewing
[00:51:34] anti-emetic hate and what did the
[00:51:38] president then at the time say there
[00:51:40] were fine people on each side let's
[00:51:43] remember that when it came to the proud
[00:51:46] boys a
[00:51:48] militia the president said the former
[00:51:50] president said stand back and stand by
[00:51:53] so for everyone watching who remembers
[00:51:56] what J January 6th
[00:51:58] was I say we don't have to go back let's
[00:52:02] not go back we're not going back it's
[00:52:04] time to turn the page and if that was a
[00:52:08] bridge too far for you well there is a
[00:52:10] place in our campaign for you to
[00:52:14] stand for country to stand for our
[00:52:18] democracy to stand for rule of law and
[00:52:21] to end the
[00:52:23] chaos and to end the approach that is
[00:52:27] about attacking the foundations of our
[00:52:29] democracy CU you don't like the outcome
[00:52:32] and be clear on that point Donald Trump
[00:52:35] the candidate has said in this election
[00:52:38] there will be a
[00:52:39] bloodbath if this and the outcome of
[00:52:41] this election is not to his
[00:52:44] liking let's turn the page on this let's
[00:52:46] not go back let's chart a course for the
[00:52:50] future and not go backwards to the past
[00:52:54] let me just follow up here it was a
[00:52:56] different term and it was a term that
[00:52:58] related to energy because they have
[00:53:00] destroyed our energy business that was
[00:53:02] where bloodbath was also on
[00:53:04] Charlottesville that story has been as
[00:53:06] you would say debunked Laura Ingram Sean
[00:53:10] Hannity Jesse all of these people they
[00:53:13] covered it if they go an extra sentence
[00:53:15] they will see it was perfect it was
[00:53:17] debunked in almost every newspaper but
[00:53:20] they still bring it up just like they
[00:53:21] bring 2025 up they bring all of this
[00:53:24] stuff up I ask you this you talk about
[00:53:26] the capital why are we allowing these
[00:53:30] millions of people to come through on
[00:53:31] the southern border how come she's not
[00:53:33] doing anything and I'll tell you what I
[00:53:35] would do and I would be very proud to do
[00:53:37] it I would say we would both leave this
[00:53:39] debate right now I'd like to see her go
[00:53:42] down to Washington DC during this debate
[00:53:45] because we're wasting a lot of time go
[00:53:47] down to because she's been so bad it's
[00:53:49] so ridiculous go down to Washington DC
[00:53:52] and let her sign a bill to close up the
[00:53:54] Border because they have the right to to
[00:53:56] do it they don't need bills they have
[00:53:58] the right to do it the president of the
[00:54:00] United States you'll get them out of bed
[00:54:01] you'll wake them up at 4:00 in the
[00:54:03] afternoon you'll say come on come on
[00:54:05] down to the office let's sign a bill If
[00:54:07] he if he signs a bill that the border is
[00:54:09] closed all he has to do is say it to the
[00:54:11] border patrol who are phenomenal if they
[00:54:14] do that the border is closed those
[00:54:16] people are killing many people unlike j6
[00:54:19] we talked immigration here tonight I do
[00:54:20] want to focus on this next issue to both
[00:54:23] of you because it really brings us uh
[00:54:24] this into Focus Truth uh in these times
[00:54:26] that we're living in uh Mr President for
[00:54:28] three and a half years after uh you lost
[00:54:30] the 2020 election you repeatedly falsely
[00:54:33] claimed that you won many times saying
[00:54:35] you won in a landslide in the past
[00:54:37] couple of weeks leading up to this
[00:54:38] debate uh you have said quote you lost
[00:54:40] by a whisker that you quote didn't quite
[00:54:43] make it that you came up a little bit
[00:54:44] short are that are you now acknowledging
[00:54:47] that you lost in 2020 I don't
[00:54:49] acknowledge it at all said that
[00:54:50] sarcastically you know that it we said
[00:54:52] oh we lost by a whisker that was said
[00:54:54] sarcastically look there's so much proof
[00:54:57] all you have to do is look at it and
[00:54:59] they should have sent it back to the
[00:55:01] legislatures for approval I got almost
[00:55:03] 75 million votes the most votes any
[00:55:05] sitting president has ever gotten I was
[00:55:07] told if I got 63 which was what I got in
[00:55:10] 2016 you can't be beaten the election
[00:55:13] people should never be thinking about an
[00:55:15] election is fraudulent we need two
[00:55:17] things we need walls we need and we have
[00:55:20] to have it we have to have borders and
[00:55:22] we have to have good elections our
[00:55:24] elections are bad and a lot of of these
[00:55:26] illegal immigrants coming in they're
[00:55:28] trying to get them to vote they can't
[00:55:30] even speak English they don't even know
[00:55:31] what country they're in practically and
[00:55:33] these people are trying to get them to
[00:55:35] vote and that's why they're allowing
[00:55:37] them to come into our country I did
[00:55:39] watch all of these pieces of video I I
[00:55:41] didn't detect the sarcasm lost by
[00:55:43] whisker we didn't quite make it and we
[00:55:45] should just point out here as
[00:55:46] clarification and you know this you and
[00:55:47] your allies 60 cases in front of many
[00:55:49] judges many of them J looked at it and
[00:55:52] said said we didn't have standing that's
[00:55:54] the other thing they said we didn't have
[00:55:56] standing a technicality can you imagine
[00:55:58] a system where a person in an election
[00:56:01] doesn't have standing the president of
[00:56:03] the United States doesn't have standing
[00:56:06] that's how we lost if you look at the
[00:56:08] facts and I'd love to have you you'll do
[00:56:10] a special on it I'll show you Georgia
[00:56:12] and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll
[00:56:14] show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you
[00:56:17] we have so many facts and statistics but
[00:56:19] you know what that doesn't matter
[00:56:21] because we have to solve the problem
[00:56:23] that we have right now that's old news
[00:56:25] and the problem that we have right now
[00:56:27] is we have a nation in Decline and they
[00:56:30] have put it into decline we have a
[00:56:33] nation that is dying David Mr President
[00:56:35] thank you uh vice president Harris you
[00:56:37] heard the president there tonight he
[00:56:39] said he didn't say that that he lost by
[00:56:40] whisker so he still uh believes uh he
[00:56:42] did not lose the election uh that was
[00:56:45] won by President Biden uh and yourself
[00:56:48] but I do want to ask you about something
[00:56:49] that's come up in the last couple of
[00:56:50] days this was a post from uh president
[00:56:52] Trump about this upcoming election just
[00:56:55] weeks away he said when I win those
[00:56:57] people who cheated and then he lists
[00:56:58] donors voters election officials he says
[00:57:01] will be prosecuted to the fullest extent
[00:57:02] of the law which will include long-term
[00:57:05] prison sentences one of your campaign's
[00:57:07] top lawyers responded saying we won't
[00:57:09] let Donald Trump intimidate us we won't
[00:57:11] let him suppress the vote is that what
[00:57:13] you believe he's trying to do
[00:57:15] here Donald Trump was fired by 81
[00:57:18] million people so let's be clear about
[00:57:21] that and clearly he is having a very
[00:57:23] difficult time processing that but we
[00:57:26] cannot afford to have a president of the
[00:57:28] United States who attempts as he did in
[00:57:33] the past to upend the will of the voters
[00:57:36] in a free and fair election and I'm
[00:57:39] going to tell you that I I have traveled
[00:57:41] the world as vice president United
[00:57:43] States and world leaders are laughing at
[00:57:46] Donald Trump I have talked with military
[00:57:49] leaders some of whom worked with you and
[00:57:52] they say you're a
[00:57:53] disgrace and when you then talk in this
[00:57:57] way in a presidential debate and deny
[00:58:00] what over and over again are court cases
[00:58:03] you have lost because you did in fact
[00:58:06] lose that election it leads one to
[00:58:09] believe that perhaps we do not have in
[00:58:12] the candidate to my right the
[00:58:14] temperament or or the ability to not be
[00:58:18] confused about fact that's deeply
[00:58:22] troubling and the American people
[00:58:23] deserve better I'll give you one minute
[00:58:26] minute to respond Mr President let me
[00:58:27] just tell you about world leaders Victor
[00:58:29] Orban one of the most respected men they
[00:58:31] call him a strong man he's a he's a
[00:58:33] tough person smart prime minister of
[00:58:36] Hungary they said why is the whole world
[00:58:39] blowing up three years ago it wasn't why
[00:58:41] is it blowing up he said because you
[00:58:44] need Trump back as president they were
[00:58:47] afraid of him China was afraid and I
[00:58:49] don't like to use the word afraid but
[00:58:51] I'm just quoting him China was afraid of
[00:58:53] him North Korea was afraid of him look
[00:58:56] at what's going on with North Korea by
[00:58:57] the way he said Russia was afraid of him
[00:59:00] I ended the nordstream 2 Pipeline and
[00:59:03] Biden put it back on day one but he
[00:59:05] ended the XL Pipeline the XL pipeline in
[00:59:09] our country he ended that but he let the
[00:59:11] Russians build a pipeline going all over
[00:59:13] Europe and heading into Germany the
[00:59:15] biggest pipeline in the world look
[00:59:18] Victor Orban said it he said the most
[00:59:22] respected most feared person is Donald
[00:59:25] Trump we had no problems when Trump was
[00:59:27] president but when this weak pathetic
[00:59:30] man that you saw at a debate just a few
[00:59:33] months ago that if he weren't in that
[00:59:35] debate he'd be running on set of HSE he
[00:59:37] got no votes he got 14 million votes
[00:59:39] what you did you talk about a threat to
[00:59:41] democracy he got 14 million votes and
[00:59:44] they threw him out of office and you
[00:59:46] know what I'll give you a little secret
[00:59:47] he hates her he can't stand her but he
[00:59:50] got 14 million votes they threw him out
[00:59:53] she got zero votes and when she ran she
[00:59:56] was the first one to leave because she
[00:59:58] failed and now she's running I don't
[01:00:01] understand it but I'm okay with it
[01:00:02] because your time is up I think we're
[01:00:04] going to do very well we've got a lot
[01:00:05] more to get to Turning now to the Israel
[01:00:07] Hamas War and the hostages who are still
[01:00:09] being held Americans among them vice
[01:00:12] president Harris in December you said
[01:00:14] quote Israel has a right to defend
[01:00:15] itself but you added quote it matters
[01:00:17] how saying International humanitarian
[01:00:20] law must be respected Israel must do
[01:00:22] more to protect innocent civilians you
[01:00:24] said that 9 months ago now an estimated
[01:00:27] 40,000 Palestinians are dead nearly 100
[01:00:30] hostages remain just last week prime
[01:00:33] minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's
[01:00:35] not a deal in the making President Biden
[01:00:37] has not been able to break through the
[01:00:39] stalemate how would you do
[01:00:41] it well let's understand how we got here
[01:00:44] on October 7 Hamas a terrorist
[01:00:50] organization slaughtered 1200 Israelis
[01:00:54] many of them young people who were
[01:00:56] simply attending a concert women were
[01:00:58] horribly raped and so absolutely I said
[01:01:02] then I say now Israel has a right to
[01:01:05] defend itself we
[01:01:06] would and how it does so matters because
[01:01:10] it is also true far too many innocent
[01:01:13] Palestinians have been killed children
[01:01:17] mothers what we know is that this war
[01:01:20] must end it must when end immediately
[01:01:24] and the way it will end is we need a
[01:01:27] ceasefire deal and we need the hostages
[01:01:29] out and so we will continue to work
[01:01:31] around the clock on that work around the
[01:01:35] clock also understanding that we must
[01:01:37] chart a course for a two-state solution
[01:01:40] and in that solution there must be
[01:01:44] security for the Israeli people and
[01:01:46] Israel and in equal measure for the
[01:01:48] Palestinians but the one thing I will
[01:01:50] assure you always I will always give
[01:01:52] Israel the ability to defend itself in
[01:01:55] particular as it rates to as it relates
[01:01:57] to Iran and any threat that Iran and its
[01:02:00] proxies pose to Israel but we must have
[01:02:04] a two-state solution where we can
[01:02:05] rebuild Gaza where the Palestinians have
[01:02:09] security self-determination and the
[01:02:11] dignity they so rightly deserve
[01:02:14] president Trump how would you negotiate
[01:02:16] with Netanyahu and also Hamas in order
[01:02:19] to get the hostages out and prevent the
[01:02:21] killing of more innocent civilians in
[01:02:23] Gaza if I were president it would have
[01:02:25] never started if I were president Russia
[01:02:28] would have never ever I know Putin very
[01:02:31] well he would have never and there was
[01:02:33] no threat of it either by the way for
[01:02:34] four years have gone into Ukraine and
[01:02:37] killed millions of people when you added
[01:02:40] up far worse than people understand
[01:02:41] what's going on over there but when she
[01:02:44] mentions about Israel all of a sudden
[01:02:47] she hates Israel she wouldn't even meet
[01:02:50] with Netanyahu when he went to Congress
[01:02:52] to make a very important speech she
[01:02:54] refused to be there because she was at a
[01:02:56] sority party of hers she wanted to go to
[01:02:58] the sority party she hates Israel if
[01:03:01] she's president I believe that Israel
[01:03:04] will not exist within two years from now
[01:03:06] and I've been pretty good at predictions
[01:03:08] and I hope I'm wrong about that one she
[01:03:10] hates Israel at the same time in her own
[01:03:13] way she hates the Arab population
[01:03:16] because the whole place is going to get
[01:03:19] blown up Arabs Jewish people Israel
[01:03:23] Israel will be gone it would have never
[01:03:26] happened Iran was broke under Donald
[01:03:29] Trump now Iran has $300 billion because
[01:03:33] they took off all the sanctions that I
[01:03:34] had Iran had no money for Hamas or
[01:03:37] Hezbollah or any of the 28 different uh
[01:03:40] spheres of Terror and they are spheres
[01:03:43] of Terror horrible Terror they had no
[01:03:45] money it was a big story and you know it
[01:03:48] you covered it very well actually they
[01:03:50] had no money for Terror they were broke
[01:03:54] now they're a rich Nation and now what
[01:03:56] they're doing is they're spreading that
[01:03:58] money around look at what's happening
[01:04:01] with the htis and Yemen look at what's
[01:04:04] going on in the Middle East this would
[01:04:05] have never happened I will get that
[01:04:07] settled and fast and I'll get the war
[01:04:10] with Ukraine and Russia ended if I'm
[01:04:13] president-elect I'll get it done before
[01:04:16] even becoming president vice president
[01:04:18] Harris he says you hate Israel that's
[01:04:21] absolutely not true I have my entire
[01:04:24] career and life so supported Israel and
[01:04:27] the Israeli people he knows that he's
[01:04:29] trying to again divide and and distract
[01:04:33] from the reality which is it is very
[01:04:35] well known that Donald Trump is weak and
[01:04:39] wrong on National Security and foreign
[01:04:41] policy it is well known that he admires
[01:04:44] dictators wants to be a dictator on day
[01:04:47] one according to himself it is well
[01:04:50] known that he said of Putin that he can
[01:04:55] do what ever the hell he wants and go
[01:04:57] into Ukraine it is well known that he
[01:05:00] said when Russia went into Ukraine it
[01:05:02] was
[01:05:03] brilliant it is well known he exchanged
[01:05:07] love letters with Kim
[01:05:09] Jong-un and it is absolutely well known
[01:05:12] that these dictators and autocrats are
[01:05:15] rooting for you to be president again
[01:05:18] because they're so clear they can
[01:05:20] manipulate you with flattery and favors
[01:05:24] and that is why
[01:05:27] so many military leaders who you have
[01:05:29] worked with have told me you are a
[01:05:32] disgrace that is why we understand that
[01:05:35] we have to have a president who is not
[01:05:38] consistently weak and wrong on National
[01:05:41] Security including the importance of
[01:05:43] upholding and respecting in highest
[01:05:45] regard our military vice president
[01:05:47] Harris thank you they're the ones and
[01:05:49] she's the one that caused it that's weak
[01:05:52] on National Security by allowing Every
[01:05:54] Nation last month for the year 168
[01:05:58] different countries sending people into
[01:06:00] our country their crime weights are way
[01:06:03] down Putin endorsed her last week said I
[01:06:06] hope she wins and I think he meant it
[01:06:08] because what he's gotten away with is
[01:06:10] absolutely incredible it wouldn't have
[01:06:12] happened with me the leaders of other
[01:06:15] countries think that they're weak and
[01:06:17] incompetent and they are they're grossly
[01:06:20] incompetent and I just ask one question
[01:06:23] why does Biden go in and kill the
[01:06:24] Keystone pipe
[01:06:26] and approve the single biggest deal that
[01:06:28] Russia's ever made nordstream 2 the
[01:06:30] biggest pipeline anywhere in the world
[01:06:32] going to Germany and all over Europe
[01:06:34] because they're weak and they're
[01:06:36] ineffective and Biden by the way gets
[01:06:38] paid a lot of money thank you we have a
[01:06:40] lot of issues to get to we'll be right
[01:06:41] back with much more of this historic ABC

[01:11:47] presidential debate tonight we're going

[01:11:50] the war in Ukraine we're now two and a
[01:11:51] half years uh into this conflict Mr
[01:11:53] President it has been the position of
[01:11:55] the Biden Administration that we must
[01:11:57] defend Ukraine from Russia from Vladimir
[01:11:59] Putin to defend their sovereignty their
[01:12:01] democracy that it's an America's best
[01:12:03] interest to do so arguing that if Putin
[01:12:05] wins he may be embolden to move even
[01:12:07] further into other countries you have
[01:12:09] said you would solve this war in 24
[01:12:11] hours you said so just before the break
[01:12:12] tonight how exactly would you do that
[01:12:15] and I want to ask you a very simple
[01:12:16] question tonight do you want Ukraine to
[01:12:19] win this War I want the war to stop I
[01:12:22] want to save lives that are being
[01:12:24] uselessly
[01:12:25] people being killed by the millions it's
[01:12:28] the millions it's so much worse than the
[01:12:30] numbers that you're getting which are
[01:12:32] fake numbers look we're in for 250
[01:12:36] billion or more because they don't ask
[01:12:38] Europe which is a much bigger
[01:12:40] beneficiary to getting this thing done
[01:12:43] than we are they're in for $150 billion
[01:12:46] doll less because Biden and you don't
[01:12:49] have the courage to ask Europe like I
[01:12:52] did with NATO they paid billions and
[01:12:55] billions hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:12:57] when I said either you pay up or we're
[01:12:59] not going to protect you anymore so
[01:13:01] that's maybe one of the reasons I don't
[01:13:02] like me as much as they like weak people
[01:13:05] but you take a look at what's happening
[01:13:08] we're in for 250 to 275 billion they're
[01:13:12] into 100 to 150 they should be forced to
[01:13:16] equalize with that being said I want to
[01:13:19] get the War settled I know zalinski very
[01:13:21] well and I know Putin very well I have a
[01:13:23] good relationship and they resp respect
[01:13:26] your president okay they respect me they
[01:13:28] don't respect Biden how would you
[01:13:30] respect him why for what reason he
[01:13:32] hasn't even made a phone call in two
[01:13:34] years to Putin hasn't spoken to anybody
[01:13:36] they don't even try and get it that is a
[01:13:38] war that's dying to be settled I will
[01:13:41] get it settled before I even become
[01:13:43] president if I win when I'm
[01:13:45] president-elect and what I'll do is I'll
[01:13:47] speak to one I'll speak to the other
[01:13:49] I'll get them together that war would
[01:13:51] have never happened and in fact when I
[01:13:53] saw Putin after after I left
[01:13:56] unfortunately left because our our
[01:13:58] country has gone to hell but after I
[01:14:00] left when I saw him building up soldiers
[01:14:02] he did it after I left I said oh he must
[01:14:06] be negotiating it must be a good strong
[01:14:08] point of negotiation well it wasn't
[01:14:10] because Biden had no idea how to talk to
[01:14:13] him he had no idea how to stop it and
[01:14:16] now you have millions of people dead and
[01:14:18] it's only getting worse and it could
[01:14:19] lead to World War II don't kid yourself
[01:14:22] David we're playing with World War III
[01:14:24] and we have a president that we don't
[01:14:26] even know if he's where is our president
[01:14:28] we don't even know if he's a president
[01:14:30] and just to clarify they threw him out
[01:14:31] of a campaign like a dog we don't even
[01:14:33] know is he our president but we have a
[01:14:36] president Mr that doesn't know he's
[01:14:38] alive your time is up and with just to
[01:14:40] clarify in the question do you believe
[01:14:42] it's in the US best interest for Ukraine
[01:14:45] to win this war yes or no I think it's
[01:14:46] the US best interest to get this war
[01:14:48] finished and just get it done negotiate
[01:14:51] a deal because we have to stop all of
[01:14:53] these human lives from being destroyed I
[01:14:56] want to take this to vice president
[01:14:57] Harris I want to get your thoughts on
[01:14:59] support for Ukraine in this moment but
[01:15:02] also as commander-in-chief if elected
[01:15:05] how would you deal with Vladimir Putin
[01:15:06] and would it be any different from what
[01:15:07] we're seeing from President Biden well
[01:15:10] first of all it's important to remind
[01:15:12] the former president you're not running
[01:15:14] against Joe Biden you're running against
[01:15:16] me I believe the reason that Donald
[01:15:19] Trump says that this war would be over
[01:15:21] within 24 hours is because he would just
[01:15:23] give it up and that's not who we are as
[01:15:25] Americans let's understand what happened
[01:15:27] here um I actually met with zalinski a
[01:15:31] few days before Russia invaded tried
[01:15:35] through Force to change territorial
[01:15:38] boundaries to defy one of the most
[01:15:40] important International rules and Norms
[01:15:42] which is the importance of sovereignty
[01:15:44] and territorial integrity and I met with
[01:15:47] President zansky I shared with him
[01:15:49] American intelligence about how he could
[01:15:51] defend himself days later I went to
[01:15:53] NATO's Eastern flank to Poland and
[01:15:56] Romania and through the work that I and
[01:15:59] others did we brought 50 countries
[01:16:01] together to support Ukraine in its
[01:16:04] righteous defense and because of our
[01:16:07] support because of the air defense the
[01:16:10] ammunition the artillery the javelins
[01:16:13] the Abrams tanks that we have provided
[01:16:15] Ukraine stands as an independent and
[01:16:18] free country if Donald Trump were
[01:16:20] President Putin would be sitting in keev
[01:16:22] right now and understand what that would
[01:16:24] mean
[01:16:25] because Putin's agenda is not just about
[01:16:29] Ukraine understand why the European
[01:16:31] allies and our NATO allies are so
[01:16:34] thankful that you are no longer
[01:16:36] president and that we understand the
[01:16:40] importance of the greatest military
[01:16:41] Alliance the world has ever known which
[01:16:43] is NATO and what we have done to
[01:16:46] preserve the ability of zeny and the
[01:16:49] ukrainians to fight for their
[01:16:50] independence otherwise Putin would be
[01:16:53] sitting in keev with with his eyes on
[01:16:55] the rest of Europe starting with Poland
[01:16:58] and why don't you tell the 800,000
[01:17:00] polish Americans right here in
[01:17:01] Pennsylvania how quickly you would give
[01:17:04] up for the sake of favor and what you
[01:17:07] think is a friendship with what is known
[01:17:10] to be a dictator who would eat you for
[01:17:13] lunch vice president Harris thank you
[01:17:15] we've heard from both of you on Ukraine
[01:17:17] tonight Afghanistan came up in the last
[01:17:19] hour I I wanted her to respond to
[01:17:21] something you said earlier and I please
[01:17:23] I'll I'll give you a minute here
[01:17:25] Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he
[01:17:28] wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women
[01:17:31] but he would have been sitting in Moscow
[01:17:33] quiet please he would have been sitting
[01:17:36] in Moscow much happier than he is right
[01:17:39] now but eventually you know he's got a
[01:17:41] thing that other people don't have he's
[01:17:43] got nuclear weapons they don't ever talk
[01:17:45] about that he got nuclear weapons nobody
[01:17:47] ever thinks about that and eventually
[01:17:50] maybe he'll use him and maybe hasn't
[01:17:52] been that threatening but he does have
[01:17:55] that something we don't even like to
[01:17:56] talk about nobody likes to talk about it
[01:17:59] but just so you understand they sent her
[01:18:01] to negotiate peace before this war
[01:18:03] started three days later he went in and
[01:18:06] he started the war because everything
[01:18:09] they said was weak and stupid they said
[01:18:12] the wrong things that war should have
[01:18:13] never started she was the Emissary they
[01:18:16] sent her in to negotiate with zalinski
[01:18:19] and Putin and she did and the war
[01:18:22] started 3 days later that's kind of
[01:18:25] talent we have with her she's worse than
[01:18:27] Biden in my opinion I think he's the
[01:18:29] worst president in the history of our
[01:18:30] country she goes down as the worst vice
[01:18:33] president in the history of our country
[01:18:35] but let me tell you something she is a
[01:18:37] horrible negotiator they sent her into
[01:18:40] negotiate as soon as they left Putin did
[01:18:43] The Invasion president Trump thank you
[01:18:45] you did bring up something you said she
[01:18:46] went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin
[01:18:47] vice president Harris have you ever met
[01:18:49] Vladimir Putin can you clarify tonight
[01:18:51] yet again I said it at the beginning of
[01:18:53] this debate you're going to hear a bunch
[01:18:54] of Lies coming from this fellow and that
[01:18:56] is another one when I went to meet with
[01:18:59] President Zen I've now met with him over
[01:19:01] five
[01:19:01] times the reality is it has been about
[01:19:05] standing as America always should as a
[01:19:08] leader upholding International rules and
[01:19:11] Norms as a leader who shows strength
[01:19:15] understanding that the alliances we have
[01:19:17] around the world are dependent on our
[01:19:21] ability to look out for our friends and
[01:19:24] not favor our enemies because you adore
[01:19:27] strong men instead of caring about
[01:19:31] democracy and that is very much what is
[01:19:33] at stake here the president of the
[01:19:35] United States is commanderin-chief and
[01:19:38] the American people have a right to rely
[01:19:42] on a president who understands the
[01:19:45] significance of America's role and
[01:19:48] responsibility in terms of ensuring that
[01:19:51] there is stability and ensuring we stand
[01:19:53] up for our princip and not sell them for
[01:19:56] the for the benefit of personal flattery
[01:20:00] we've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir
[01:20:01] Putin I do want to talk about
[01:20:03] Afghanistan it came up in in the first
[01:20:04] hour of this debate I I wanted to move
[01:20:07] on to Afghanistan Stenberg said Trump
[01:20:09] did the most amazing thing I've ever
[01:20:11] seen he got these countries the 28
[01:20:13] countries at the time to pay up he said
[01:20:16] I've never seen he's the head of NATO he
[01:20:18] said I've never seen for years we were
[01:20:21] paying almost all of NATO we were being
[01:20:23] ripped off by European nations both on
[01:20:26] trade and on NATO I got them to pay up
[01:20:29] by saying one of the statements you made
[01:20:30] before if you don't pay we're not going
[01:20:33] to protect you otherwise we would have
[01:20:35] never gotten it he said it was one of
[01:20:36] the most incredible jobs that he's ever
[01:20:38] seen done thank you I want to turn to
[01:20:40] Afghanistan it came up in the first hour
[01:20:42] of the debate and we witnessed a a
[01:20:44] poignant moment today on Capitol Hill
[01:20:45] honoring the soldiers who died in the
[01:20:47] chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan I do
[01:20:49] want to ask the vice president uh do you
[01:20:51] believe you bear any responsibility in
[01:20:54] the way that with withdrawal played out
[01:20:56] well I will tell you I agreed with
[01:20:58] President Biden's decision to pull out
[01:21:00] of Afghanistan for presidents said they
[01:21:03] would and Joe Biden did and as a result
[01:21:07] America's taxpayers are not paying the
[01:21:09] $300 million a day we were paying for
[01:21:11] that endless war and as of today there
[01:21:15] is not one member of the United States
[01:21:18] military who is in active duty in a
[01:21:21] combat zone in any war zone around the
[01:21:23] world the first time this Century but
[01:21:26] let's understand how we got to where we
[01:21:28] are Donald Trump when he was president
[01:21:31] negotiated one of the weakest deals you
[01:21:34] can imagine he calls himself a dealmaker
[01:21:37] even his National Security advisor said
[01:21:39] it was a weak terrible deal and here's
[01:21:42] how it went down he bypassed the Afghan
[01:21:45] government he negotiated directly with a
[01:21:48] terrorist organization called the
[01:21:50] Taliban the negotiation involved the
[01:21:52] Taliban getting 5,000 terrorist Taliban
[01:21:55] terrorist released and get this no get
[01:21:58] this and the president at the time
[01:22:02] invited the Taliban to Camp
[01:22:05] David a place of stored significance for
[01:22:09] us as Americans a place where we honor
[01:22:12] the importance of American diplomacy
[01:22:14] where we invite and receive respected
[01:22:17] world leaders and
[01:22:21] this former president as president
[01:22:24] invited them to Camp David because he
[01:22:29] does not again appreciate the role and
[01:22:33] responsibility of the president of the
[01:22:35] United States to be commanderin-chief
[01:22:38] with a level of respect and this gets
[01:22:41] back to the point of how he has
[01:22:43] consistently disparaged and demeaned
[01:22:45] members of our military fallen soldiers
[01:22:49] and the work that we must do to uphold
[01:22:51] the strength and the respect of the
[01:22:54] United States of America around the
[01:22:55] world vice president Harris thank you
[01:22:57] president Trump your response to her
[01:22:59] saying that you began the negotiations
[01:23:00] with the Taliban so if you take a look
[01:23:03] at that period of time the Taliban was
[01:23:06] killing our soldiers a lot of them with
[01:23:10] snipers and I got involved with the
[01:23:13] Taliban because the Taliban was doing
[01:23:15] the killing that's the Fighting Force
[01:23:17] within Afghanistan they don't bother
[01:23:18] doing that because you know they deal
[01:23:20] with the wrong people all the time but I
[01:23:22] got involved and ab Abdul is the head of
[01:23:25] the Taliban he is still the head of the
[01:23:27] Taliban and I told Abdul don't do it
[01:23:30] anymore you do it anymore you're going
[01:23:31] to have problems and he said why do you
[01:23:33] send me a picture of my house I said
[01:23:35] you're going to have to figure that out
[01:23:36] Abdul and for 18 months we had nobody
[01:23:40] killed we did have an agreement
[01:23:42] negotiated by Mike Pompeo it was a very
[01:23:44] good agreement the reason it was good it
[01:23:47] was we were getting out we would have
[01:23:49] been out faster than them but we
[01:23:50] wouldn't have lost the soldiers we
[01:23:51] wouldn't have left many Americans behind
[01:23:53] and we wouldn't have left we wouldn't
[01:23:55] have left $85 billion worth of brand new
[01:23:59] beautiful military equipment behind and
[01:24:01] just to finish they blew it the
[01:24:05] agreement said you have to do this this
[01:24:07] this this this and they didn't do it
[01:24:10] they didn't do it the agreement was was
[01:24:13] terminated by us because they didn't do
[01:24:16] what they were supposed to do I want to
[01:24:18] move on and these people did the worst
[01:24:21] withdrawal and in my opinion the most
[01:24:23] embarrassing moment in the history of
[01:24:25] our country and by the way that's why
[01:24:27] Russia attacked Ukraine because they saw
[01:24:30] how incompetent she and her boss are
[01:24:33] President Trump thank you I want to move
[01:24:35] on now to race and politics in this
[01:24:37] country Mr President you recently said a
[01:24:39] vice president Harris quot I didn't know
[01:24:41] she was black until a number of years
[01:24:42] ago when she happened to turn black and
[01:24:45] now she wants to be known as black I
[01:24:47] want to ask a bigger picture question
[01:24:49] here tonight why do you believe it's
[01:24:51] appropriate to weigh in on the racial
[01:24:52] identity of your opponent don't and I
[01:24:55] don't care I don't care what she is I
[01:24:57] don't care uh you make a big deal out of
[01:25:00] something I couldn't care less whatever
[01:25:02] she wants to be is okay with me but
[01:25:05] those were your words so I'm asking I
[01:25:06] don't know I don't know I mean all I can
[01:25:07] say is I read where she was not black
[01:25:11] that she put out and I'll say that and
[01:25:14] then I read that she was black and
[01:25:17] that's okay either one was okay with me
[01:25:19] that's up to her that's up to her vice
[01:25:21] president Harris your thoughts on this
[01:25:24] I think it's I mean honestly I think
[01:25:26] it's a a tragedy that we have um someone
[01:25:29] who wants to be president who has
[01:25:33] consistently over the course of his
[01:25:35] career attempted to use race to divide
[01:25:38] the American people you know I do
[01:25:41] believe that the vast majority of us
[01:25:42] know that we have so much more in common
[01:25:44] than what separates us and we don't want
[01:25:46] this kind of approach that is just
[01:25:48] constantly trying to divide us and
[01:25:50] especially by race and let's
[01:25:52] remember how Donald Trump started he was
[01:25:55] a a a a land he owned land he owned
[01:26:00] buildings and he he was investigated
[01:26:03] because he refused to
[01:26:06] rent property to black families let's
[01:26:09] remember this is the same individual who
[01:26:12] took out a full page ad in the New York
[01:26:15] Times calling for the
[01:26:17] execution of five young black and Latino
[01:26:22] boys who were innocent the Central Park
[01:26:26] 5 took out a full page ad calling for
[01:26:29] their execution this is the same
[01:26:31] individual who spread birther lies about
[01:26:34] the first black president of the United
[01:26:37] States and I think the American people
[01:26:40] want better than that want better than
[01:26:44] this want someone who understands as I
[01:26:47] do I travel our
[01:26:49] country we see in each other a friend we
[01:26:53] see in each other a neighbor we don't
[01:26:56] want a leader who is constantly trying
[01:26:59] to have Americans Point their fingers at
[01:27:01] each other I meet with people all the
[01:27:04] time who tell me can we please just have
[01:27:08] discourse about how we're going to
[01:27:11] invest in the aspirations and the
[01:27:13] Ambitions and the dreams of the American
[01:27:15] people knowing that regardless of
[01:27:17] people's color or the language their
[01:27:20] grandmother speaks we all have the same
[01:27:22] dreams and aspirations and want to
[01:27:24] president who invest in those not in
[01:27:27] hate and division vice president Harris
[01:27:29] thank you Lindsay president Trump this
[01:27:31] is now your third
[01:27:33] time this is the most divisive
[01:27:36] presidency in the history of our country
[01:27:39] there's never been anything like it
[01:27:40] they're destroying our country and they
[01:27:43] come up with things like what she just
[01:27:46] said going back many many years when a
[01:27:49] lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg
[01:27:50] agreed with me on the Central Park 5
[01:27:52] they admitted they said they plead
[01:27:55] guilty and I said well if they plad
[01:27:57] guilty they'd badly hurt a person killed
[01:28:00] a person ultimately and if they plad
[01:28:02] guilty then they plad were not guilty
[01:28:05] but this is a person that has to stretch
[01:28:08] back years 40 50 years ago because
[01:28:11] there's nothing now I built one of the
[01:28:13] greatest economies in the history of the
[01:28:16] world and I'm going to build it again
[01:28:17] it's going to be bigger better and
[01:28:19] stronger but they're destroying our
[01:28:21] economy they have no idea what a good
[01:28:23] economy is is their oil policies every
[01:28:26] single policy and remember this she is
[01:28:30] Biden you know she's trying to get away
[01:28:31] from Biden I don't know the gentleman
[01:28:33] she says she is Biden the worst
[01:28:36] inflation we've ever had a horrible
[01:28:39] economy because inflation has made it so
[01:28:42] bad and she can't get away with that
[01:28:44] thank you your time is up I want to
[01:28:46] respond to that though I want to just
[01:28:47] respond
[01:28:48] briefly clearly I am not Joe Biden and I
[01:28:52] am certainly not Donald Trump Trump and
[01:28:55] what I do offer is a new generation of
[01:28:57] leadership for our country one who
[01:29:00] believes in what is possible one who
[01:29:03] brings a sense of optimism about what we
[01:29:06] can do instead of always disparaging the
[01:29:09] American people I believe in what we can
[01:29:13] do to strengthen our small businesses
[01:29:16] which is why I have a plan let's talk
[01:29:18] about our plans and and let's compare
[01:29:22] the plans I have a plan
[01:29:25] to give startup businesses $50,000 tax
[01:29:29] deduction to pursue their Ambitions
[01:29:32] their Innovation their ideas their hard
[01:29:35] work I have a plan
[01:29:37] $6,000 for young families for the first
[01:29:40] year of your child's life to help you in
[01:29:43] that most critical stage of your child's
[01:29:45] development I have a plan that is about
[01:29:48] allowing people to be able to pursue
[01:29:51] what has been fleeting in terms of the
[01:29:52] American dream by by offering a help
[01:29:55] with down payment of $25,000 down
[01:29:58] payment assistance for firsttime home
[01:30:00] buyers that's the kind of conversation I
[01:30:03] believe David that people really want
[01:30:05] tonight as opposed to a conversation
[01:30:08] that is constantly about belittling and
[01:30:11] name calling let's turn the page
[01:30:14] president Harward thank you let's turn
[01:30:16] to policy let's turn to move on
[01:30:18] President Trump let's turn to policy
[01:30:20] please has a plan to defund the police
[01:30:23] she has a plan to confiscate everybody's
[01:30:26] gun has a plan to not allow fracking in
[01:30:30] Pennsylvania or anywhere else that's
[01:30:32] what her plan is until just recent I
[01:30:34] just need to respond the former
[01:30:37] president has said something twice that
[01:30:38] I need to respond to I'm sorry we're
[01:30:40] going we're going to move on vice
[01:30:41] president president Trump this is now
[01:30:43] your third time running for president
[01:30:45] you have long vowed to repeal and
[01:30:47] replace the Affordable Care Act also
[01:30:49] known as Obamacare you have failed to
[01:30:51] accomplish that you now say you're going
[01:30:53] to keep Obamacare quote unless we can do
[01:30:56] something much better last month you
[01:30:58] said quote we're working on it so
[01:31:00] tonight nine years after you first
[01:31:02] started running do you have a plan and
[01:31:04] can you tell us what it is Obamacare was
[01:31:06] lousy Health Care always was it's not
[01:31:09] very good today and what I said that if
[01:31:12] we come up with something and we are
[01:31:13] working on things we're going to do it
[01:31:15] and we're going to replace it but
[01:31:17] remember this I inherited Obamacare
[01:31:20] because Democrats wouldn't change it
[01:31:22] they wouldn't vote for it they were
[01:31:23] unanimous they wouldn't vote to change
[01:31:25] it if they would have done that we would
[01:31:27] have had a much better plan than
[01:31:29] Obamacare but the Democrats came up they
[01:31:32] wouldn't vote for it I had a choice to
[01:31:34] make when I was President do I save it
[01:31:36] and make it as good as it can be never
[01:31:38] going to be great or do I let it rot and
[01:31:42] I felt I had an obligation even though
[01:31:44] politically it would have been good to
[01:31:45] just let it rot and let it go away I
[01:31:48] decided and I told my people the top
[01:31:50] people and they very good people I have
[01:31:52] a lot of good people in this that
[01:31:53] administ ation we read about the bad
[01:31:55] ones we had some real bad ones too and
[01:31:57] so do they they have really bad ones the
[01:31:59] difference is they don't get rid of them
[01:32:00] but let me just explain I had a choice
[01:32:03] to make do I save it and make it as good
[01:32:05] as it can be or do I let it rot and I
[01:32:08] saved it I did the right thing but it's
[01:32:11] still never going to be great and it's
[01:32:13] too expensive for people and what we
[01:32:16] will do is we're looking at different
[01:32:18] plans if we can come up with a plan
[01:32:20] that's going to cost our people our
[01:32:23] population
[01:32:24] less money and be better healthare than
[01:32:26] Obamacare then I would absolutely do it
[01:32:29] but until then I'd run it as good as it
[01:32:32] can be run so just to yes or no you
[01:32:33] still do not have a plan I have concepts
[01:32:36] of a plan I'm not president right now
[01:32:39] but if we come up with something I would
[01:32:42] only change it if we come up with
[01:32:44] something that's better and less
[01:32:45] expensive and there are Concepts and
[01:32:48] options we we have to do that and you'll
[01:32:51] be hearing about it in the not too
[01:32:52] distant future vice president Harris in
[01:32:55] 2017 you supported Bernie Sanders
[01:32:57] proposal to do away with private
[01:32:58] insurance and create a government-run
[01:33:00] Health Care System two years later you
[01:33:02] proposed a plan that included a private
[01:33:04] insurance option what is your plan today
[01:33:07] well first of all I absolutely support
[01:33:09] and over the last four years as vice
[01:33:11] president private healthc care options
[01:33:13] but what we need to do is maintain and
[01:33:15] grow the Affordable Care Act but I I
[01:33:17] I'll get to that Lindsay I just need to
[01:33:18] respond to a previous point that the
[01:33:20] former president has made I've made very
[01:33:22] clear my position on tracking and then
[01:33:24] this business about taking everyone's
[01:33:26] guns away Tim Walls and I are both gun
[01:33:28] owners we're not taking anybody's guns
[01:33:30] away so stop with the continuous lying
[01:33:32] about this stuff as it relates to the
[01:33:34] Affordable Care Act understand let just
[01:33:37] look at the history to know where people
[01:33:38] stand when Donald Trump was President 60
[01:33:42] times he tried to get rid of the
[01:33:44] Affordable Care Act 60 times I was a
[01:33:46] Senator at the time when I will never
[01:33:50] forget the early morning hours when it
[01:33:53] was up for a vote in the United States
[01:33:55] Senate and the late great John McCain
[01:33:59] who you have
[01:34:00] disparaged as being a you don't like him
[01:34:04] you said at the time because he got
[01:34:07] caught he was an American hero the late
[01:34:09] great John McCain I will never forget
[01:34:11] that night walked onto the senate floor
[01:34:14] and said no you don't no you don't no
[01:34:17] you don't get rid of the Affordable Care
[01:34:19] Act you have no plan and what the
[01:34:22] Affordable Care Act has done is
[01:34:24] eliminate the ability of insurance
[01:34:26] companies to deny people with
[01:34:27] pre-existing conditions I don't have to
[01:34:29] tell the people watching tonight you
[01:34:31] remember what that was like remember
[01:34:33] when an insurance company could deny if
[01:34:36] a child had asthma if someone was a
[01:34:39] breast cancer survivor if a if a
[01:34:41] grandparent had diabetes and thankfully
[01:34:45] as I've been vice president and we over
[01:34:47] the last four years have strengthened
[01:34:48] the Affordable Care Act we have allowed
[01:34:51] for the first time Medicare to negotiate
[01:34:52] drug prices on behalf of you the
[01:34:55] American people Donald Trump said he was
[01:34:57] going to allow Medicare to negotiate
[01:34:59] drug prices he never did we did and now
[01:35:01] we have capped the cost of insulin at
[01:35:03] $35 a month since I've been Vice
[01:35:05] President we have capped the cost of
[01:35:07] prescription medication for seniors at
[01:35:08] $2,000 a year and when I am President we
[01:35:12] will do that for all people
[01:35:14] understanding that the value I bring to
[01:35:16] this is that access to health care
[01:35:19] should be a right and not just a
[01:35:21] privilege of those who can afford it and
[01:35:24] the plan has to be to strengthen the
[01:35:27] Affordable Care Act not get rid of
[01:35:30] it in terms of where Donald Trump stands
[01:35:32] on that I want to move to an issue
[01:35:34] that's important for a lot you made a
[01:35:35] mistake at number one John McCain fought
[01:35:39] Obamacare for 10 years but it wasn't
[01:35:42] only him it were all of the Democrats
[01:35:44] that kept it going and you know what we
[01:35:48] can do much better than Obamacare much
[01:35:50] less money but she won't improve private
[01:35:53] private insurance for people private
[01:35:55] medical insurance that's another thing
[01:35:58] she doesn't want to get people are
[01:35:59] paying privately for insurance that have
[01:36:01] worked hard and made money and they want
[01:36:04] to have private she wants everybody to
[01:36:06] be on government insurance where you
[01:36:08] wait six months for an operation that
[01:36:10] you need immediately president Trump
[01:36:11] thank you we have another issue that
[01:36:13] we'd like to get to that's important for
[01:36:14] a number of Americans in particular
[01:36:16] younger voters and that's climate change
[01:36:18] president Trump with regard to the
[01:36:20] environment you say that we have to have
[01:36:22] clean air and clean water vice president
[01:36:24] Harris you call climate change an
[01:36:26] existential threat the question to you
[01:36:28] both tonight is what would you do to
[01:36:31] fight climate change and vice president
[01:36:33] Harris we'll start with you one minute
[01:36:34] for you each well the former president
[01:36:37] had said the climate change is a hoax
[01:36:40] and what we know is that it is very real
[01:36:42] you ask anyone who lives in a state who
[01:36:44] has experienced these extreme weather
[01:36:46] occurrences who now is either being
[01:36:48] denied home insurance or it's being
[01:36:50] jacked up you ask anybody who has been
[01:36:53] um the victim of what that means in
[01:36:56] terms of losing their home having
[01:36:58] nowhere to go we know that we can
[01:37:01] actually deal with this issue the young
[01:37:02] people of America care deeply about this
[01:37:05] issue and I am proud that as vice
[01:37:07] president over the last four years we
[01:37:09] have invested a trillion dollars in a
[01:37:11] clean energy economy while we have also
[01:37:14] increased domestic gas production to
[01:37:17] Historic levels we have created over
[01:37:19] 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I
[01:37:22] have been vice president we have
[01:37:24] invested in clean energy to the point
[01:37:26] that we are opening up factories around
[01:37:29] the world Donald Trump said he was going
[01:37:31] to create manufacturing jobs he lost
[01:37:33] manufacturing jobs and I'm also proud to
[01:37:35] have the endorsement of the United Auto
[01:37:37] Workers and Shan feain who also know
[01:37:40] that part of building a clean energy
[01:37:42] economy includes investing in American
[01:37:46] made products American automobiles it
[01:37:49] includes growing what we can do around
[01:37:52] American manufacturing and opening up
[01:37:55] Auto plants not closing them like
[01:37:57] happened under Donald Trump vice
[01:37:58] president Harris thank you that didn't
[01:38:00] happen under Donald Trump let me just
[01:38:01] tell you they lost 10,000 manufacturing
[01:38:04] jobs this last month it's going they're
[01:38:07] all leaving uh they're building big Auto
[01:38:09] plants in Mexico in many cases owned by
[01:38:13] China they're building these massive
[01:38:15] plants and they think they're going to
[01:38:17] sell their cars into the United States
[01:38:19] because of these people what they have
[01:38:21] given to China is unbelievable
[01:38:24] but we're not going to let that we'll
[01:38:25] put tariffs on those cars so they can't
[01:38:27] come into our country because they will
[01:38:29] kill the United Auto Workers and any
[01:38:32] order worker whether it's in Detroit or
[01:38:34] South Carolina or any other place what
[01:38:36] they've done to business and
[01:38:38] Manufacturing in this country is
[01:38:41] horrible we have nothing because they
[01:38:44] they refuse you know Biden doesn't go
[01:38:46] after people because supposedly China
[01:38:48] paid a millions of dollars he's afraid
[01:38:50] to do it between him and his son they
[01:38:52] get all this money from Ukraine they get
[01:38:55] all this money from all of these
[01:38:56] different countries and then you wonder
[01:38:58] why is he so loyal to this one that one
[01:39:00] Ukraine China why is he why did he get
[01:39:03] three5 million dollar from the mayor of
[01:39:06] moscow's wife why did he get why did she
[01:39:08] pay him $35 million this is a crooked
[01:39:13] Administration and they're selling our
[01:39:15] country down the tubes president Trump
[01:39:17] thank you thank you we'll be right back
[01:39:19] with closing statements from both of our
[01:39:20] candidates in historic night this ABC
[01:39:22] News president presidential debate from
[01:39:24] Philadelphia back in a
[01:39:31] moment the ABC News presidential debate
[01:39:34] will continue after
[01:39:52] this
[01:40:22] e
[01:40:52] e
[01:41:22] e
[01:41:52] e
[01:42:22] e
[01:42:52] e
[01:43:22] e e
[01:44:12] live from the national Constitution
[01:44:14] Center in Philadelphia Pennsylvania Here
[01:44:17] Again David mure and Lindsey Davis
[01:44:21] welcome back tonight the time is for
[01:44:23] closing statements and vice president
[01:44:24] Harris we begin with
[01:44:26] you so I think you've heard tonight two
[01:44:30] very different Visions for our country
[01:44:33] one that is focused on the future and
[01:44:36] the other that is focused on the past
[01:44:38] and an attempt to take us
[01:44:41] backward but we're not going back and I
[01:44:44] do believe that the American people know
[01:44:46] we all have so much more in common than
[01:44:48] what separates us and we can chart a new
[01:44:51] way forward
[01:44:53] and a vision of that includes having a
[01:44:56] plan understanding the aspirations the
[01:44:59] dreams the hopes the ambition of the
[01:45:02] American people which is why I intend to
[01:45:05] create an opportunity economy investing
[01:45:08] in small businesses in new families in
[01:45:12] what we can do around protecting seniors
[01:45:14] what we can do that is about giving
[01:45:17] hardworking folks a break and bringing
[01:45:19] down the cost of living I believe in
[01:45:23] what we can do together that is about
[01:45:26] sustaining America's standing in the
[01:45:28] world and ensuring that we have the
[01:45:30] respect that we so rightly deserve
[01:45:32] including respecting our military and
[01:45:35] ensuring we have the most lethal
[01:45:37] fighting force in the world I will be a
[01:45:40] president that will protect our
[01:45:41] fundamental rights and freedoms
[01:45:43] including the right of a woman to make
[01:45:45] decisions about her own body and not
[01:45:47] have her government tell her what to do
[01:45:50] I'll tell you I started my career as a
[01:45:52] press I was a DA I was an attorney
[01:45:55] general a United States Senator and now
[01:45:57] Vice President I've only had one client
[01:45:59] the people and I'll tell you as a
[01:46:01] prosecutor I never asked a victim or a
[01:46:05] witness are you a Republican or a
[01:46:07] Democrat the only thing I ever ask them
[01:46:09] are you
[01:46:11] okay and that's the kind of President we
[01:46:13] need right now someone who cares about
[01:46:16] you and is not putting themselves first
[01:46:19] I intend to be a president for all
[01:46:21] Americans and focus on what we can do
[01:46:25] over the next 10 and 20 years to build
[01:46:28] back up our country by investing right
[01:46:30] now in you the American people vice
[01:46:33] president Harris thank you president
[01:46:36] Trump so she just started by saying
[01:46:38] she's going to do this she's going to do
[01:46:40] that she's going to do all these
[01:46:41] wonderful things why hasn't she done it
[01:46:44] she's been there for three and a half
[01:46:46] years they've had three and a half years
[01:46:49] to fix the Border they've had three and
[01:46:51] a half years to create jobs and all the
[01:46:54] things we talked about why hasn't she
[01:46:57] done it she should leave right now go
[01:46:59] down to that beautiful white house go to
[01:47:02] the capital get everyone together and do
[01:47:04] the things you want to do but you
[01:47:05] haven't done it and you won't do it
[01:47:07] because you believe in things that the
[01:47:09] American people don't believe in you
[01:47:11] believe in things like we're not going
[01:47:14] to Frack we're not going to take fossil
[01:47:15] fuel we're not going to do things that
[01:47:17] are going to make this country strong
[01:47:19] whether you like it or not Germany tried
[01:47:22] that and within one year they were back
[01:47:24] to building normal energy plants we're
[01:47:27] not ready for it we can't sacrifice our
[01:47:31] country for the sake of bad Vision but I
[01:47:34] just ask one simple question why didn't
[01:47:37] she do it we're a failing Nation We're a
[01:47:40] nation that's in serious decline we're
[01:47:43] being laughed at all over the world all
[01:47:45] over the world they're laugh I know the
[01:47:47] leaders very well they're coming to see
[01:47:49] me they call me we're laughed at all
[01:47:51] over the world they don't understand
[01:47:53] what happened to us as a nation we're
[01:47:55] not a leader we don't have any idea
[01:47:58] what's going on we have wars going on in
[01:48:00] the Middle East we have wars going on
[01:48:03] with Russia and Ukraine we're going to
[01:48:05] end up in a third world war and it'll be
[01:48:08] a war like no other because of nuclear
[01:48:10] weapons the power of Weaponry I rebuilt
[01:48:13] our entire military she gave a lot of it
[01:48:16] away to the Taliban she gave it to
[01:48:20] Afghanistan what these people have done
[01:48:22] into our country and maybe toughest of
[01:48:24] all is allowing millions of people to
[01:48:27] come into our country many of them are
[01:48:29] criminals and they're destroying our
[01:48:31] country the worst president the worst
