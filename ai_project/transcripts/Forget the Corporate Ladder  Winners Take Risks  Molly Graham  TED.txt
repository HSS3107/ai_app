[00:00:04] There's a lot of pressure around
what it takes to build a great career.
[00:00:09] And it all comes back to this idea
[00:00:11] that you're supposed to know
what you want to do.
[00:00:14] It’s an idea
that I like to call “the stairs.”
[00:00:19] Here's how the stairs go.
[00:00:22] You show up in college,
[00:00:23] and you're supposed to know
what you want to major in.
[00:00:26] That major is supposed
to lead you to your first job,
[00:00:30] and then you get another job,
[00:00:32] and you get promoted
and promoted and promoted forever.
[00:00:38] The best part about the stairs
is safety and security.
[00:00:43] It feels like you know
what you need to do to get ahead.
[00:00:47] The worst part of the stairs
is that it's like a weird video game
[00:00:51] that you can get stuck
inside of for years.
[00:00:54] The stairs will make you feel
[00:00:56] like your self-worth
is tied to your title,
[00:01:00] or your last performance rating,
or your next promotion.
[00:01:05] But the truth is
that the stairs are an illusion.
[00:01:09] These days, excellent careers
are not built by excellent stair climbers.
[00:01:16] Said differently,
[00:01:18] one of the most important things
you can get good at in your career
[00:01:21] is taking risks.
[00:01:23] Or, as I like to call it,
jumping off cliffs.
[00:01:29] Let me explain what I mean with a story.
[00:01:32] When I was 25, I got offered a crazy job.
[00:01:36] I had spent a couple of years
climbing the stairs
[00:01:39] in Human Resources at Facebook
[00:01:41] when the leader of another department
came to me and asked me to help him
[00:01:45] start a new project,
[00:01:47] doing something that I knew nothing about.
[00:01:50] It was a long-term project,
[00:01:52] it was risky, and a lot of people
told me it would probably fail.
[00:01:57] I was intrigued, but I was also scared.
[00:02:01] So I talked to a bunch
of different people,
[00:02:03] and I have to admit,
a lot of them told me not to take it.
[00:02:06] But there was this little voice inside me
that just kept saying,
[00:02:10] "I wonder.
[00:02:12] I wonder if I can be capable
in this completely new environment."
[00:02:17] So I took a risk and I took the job.
[00:02:21] Now I'd like to say
that what happened next
[00:02:23] was that it was obviously a great decision
and I was immediately successful.
[00:02:28] But actually,
[00:02:30] the first nine months on this project
[00:02:32] felt a lot more
like falling off of a very steep cliff.
[00:02:38] I had gone from feeling
competent and capable in HR
[00:02:43] to feeling like
an absolute idiot all the time.
[00:02:47] I was sitting in rooms
with brilliant people
[00:02:50] asking very dumb questions.
[00:02:53] Six months into this job,
[00:02:54] I got the lowest performance rating
of my entire life.
[00:02:58] I had so many moments
when all I wanted to do
[00:03:01] was run back to the safety
and security of the stairs.
[00:03:06] But about nine months in,
something interesting happened.
[00:03:10] I had to lead a meeting.
[00:03:12] It sounds simple,
but it was a big meeting.
[00:03:14] It was a complicated debate
about a nuanced part of this project.
[00:03:19] I was successful,
[00:03:21] and I so vividly remember
walking out of that meeting
[00:03:24] feeling like myself again.
[00:03:27] I had gone from feeling
like a beginner in this new environment
[00:03:32] to feeling confident and capable.
[00:03:35] I spent another three years
on this project,
[00:03:38] learning and growing,
[00:03:40] and on the other side of it,
I was a completely different person.
[00:03:44] I was offered jobs that no one
would have offered me
[00:03:47] if I had stayed in HR.
[00:03:49] That's the thing about jumping off cliffs.
[00:03:53] It doesn't just take you
a couple flights up on the stairs.
[00:03:57] It's like a weird elevator
that takes you to a whole new place.
[00:04:01] Cliff jumps teach you who you are
and what you are capable of
[00:04:06] in ways that the stairs can never.
[00:04:10] To get good at jumping off cliffs,
you have to get good at three things.
[00:04:16] The first is actually
jumping off the cliff.
[00:04:20] (Laughter)
[00:04:22] After many years of coaching people
through career decisions,
[00:04:26] I know that sometimes it is just
not the right time to take a risk,
[00:04:33] but I can also tell you that most people
[00:04:37] do not stay stuck on the stairs
out of necessity.
[00:04:41] They stay there out of fear.
[00:04:46] The trick is to learn
to tell the difference
[00:04:48] between the kind of fear that says,
[00:04:50] "I'm scared I might run out of money,"
[00:04:53] which you should actually listen to,
[00:04:55] and the kind of fear that says,
[00:04:57] "I'm scared I might fail,"
[00:05:00] which you should take
as a giant green flashing light to jump.
[00:05:08] Cliff jumps teach you
what you are capable of in spite of fear.
[00:05:14] The second thing you have to get good at
in order to get good at jumping off cliffs
[00:05:19] is surviving the fall.
[00:05:23] Jumping off a cliff
is taking a giant step backwards
[00:05:26] into the land of being a beginner again.
[00:05:28] That means it's a very big
learning process.
[00:05:31] And with that comes
a huge emotional roller coaster.
[00:05:36] Daily. Weekly. Sometimes hourly.
[00:05:40] All of my jumps
have involved vacillating wildly
[00:05:44] between feeling like,
"Oh, maybe I'm going to be good at this,"
[00:05:48] and then immediately feeling like,
[00:05:49] "Who the hell even gave me
this job in the first place?"
[00:05:53] All of that is normal, and it doesn't
actually mean that anything is wrong.
[00:05:58] You have to learn
to expect the roller coaster
[00:06:02] and ignore it at the same time.
[00:06:05] The most valuable mantra for me
in this phase has been: give it two weeks.
[00:06:11] A lot of people
will tell you to sleep on it.
[00:06:14] I can tell you most of these emotions
don't go away overnight.
[00:06:19] Two weeks is a great barometer
[00:06:21] for things that you should
actually pay attention to.
[00:06:25] The third thing you have to get good at
in order to get good at jumping off cliffs
[00:06:30] is becoming a professional idiot.
[00:06:32] (Laughter)
[00:06:34] I can tell you that this is
one of my greatest strengths.
[00:06:39] I am comfortable sounding like a moron.
[00:06:43] I am great at sitting in rooms
with brilliant people
[00:06:47] asking very dumb questions.
[00:06:50] But what that actually means
[00:06:52] is that I have become
an extraordinary learner.
[00:06:57] My favorite phrase is,
"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but."
[00:07:02] When you ask it that way,
everybody wants to make you feel better.
[00:07:05] They're like, "No, no,
that's not a dumb question."
[00:07:09] And then they would love
to teach you what they know.
[00:07:13] People love being teachers.
[00:07:15] It makes them feel smart.
[00:07:19] The other thing you discover
is that most stupid questions
[00:07:24] aren't actually stupid.
[00:07:27] So many people are afraid of sounding dumb
[00:07:32] that the world is littered
[00:07:34] with important questions
that never got asked.
[00:07:38] Questions like,
[00:07:39] "Can you define that word for me?",
[00:07:42] "Why are we doing this?",
[00:07:45] "Why are we having this meeting?"
[00:07:47] (Laughter)
[00:07:50] Embracing being a professional idiot
[00:07:52] often actually makes you
the most valuable person in the room.
[00:08:00] There's a last thing,
part of the illusion of the stairs,
[00:08:04] that becomes really obvious
the more cliffs that you jump off of.
[00:08:08] And that is the idea
that there is one set of stairs,
[00:08:12] one definition of success.
[00:08:16] I have a lot of friends
that have climbed up the stairs
[00:08:19] to some version of the top --
[00:08:21] a fancy title, a lot of money, fame --
[00:08:26] and then they've realized
that they're miserable.
[00:08:30] One friend described
becoming CEO of her company
[00:08:34] and immediately thinking,
[00:08:36] "Is this all there is?"
[00:08:39] You know what she did next?
[00:08:41] She jumped off a professional cliff.
[00:08:44] She went from being the CEO
of a marketing agency
[00:08:47] to helping people
who were dying in hospice.
[00:08:51] Success is not the same for everyone.
[00:08:58] I know that what
I'm talking about isn't easy.
[00:09:03] It takes bravery to trade
the known for the unknown.
[00:09:09] It takes courage to do something
[00:09:12] that might seem like a step sideways
or backwards to someone else.
[00:09:18] But you will never really know who you are
or what you are capable of
[00:09:24] until you learn how to try.
[00:09:28] Thank you.
[00:09:30] (Applause)
