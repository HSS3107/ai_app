[00:00:00] there's only two types of people in this
[00:00:01] world the conformist API consumer and
[00:00:04] the Renegade webscraper it's always been
[00:00:06] a bit of a gray area to write code that
[00:00:08] automatically extracts valuable data
[00:00:10] from websites but will you go to jail if
[00:00:12] you do it you're stealing right to jail
[00:00:14] I refuse to go back to jail but I'm
[00:00:16] literally shaking right now because the
[00:00:18] US District Court in Delaware just ruled
[00:00:20] that booking.com violated the Computer
[00:00:22] Fraud and Abuse Act by scraping the Ryan
[00:00:24] Air website booking tried to countersuit
[00:00:27] for defamation because Ryan Air hurt the
[00:00:29] corporation's Fe by calling them an otaa
[00:00:31] pirate or online travel agency pirate
[00:00:34] not surprisingly the court rejected that
[00:00:36] claim but this is not the first time
[00:00:37] that web scrapers have battled in court
[00:00:39] in today's video we'll look at the legal
[00:00:41] and ethical concerns in this case and
[00:00:43] find out if my web scraping tutorials
[00:00:44] will land you in jail it is July 26 2024
[00:00:48] and you watching the code report in this
[00:00:50] weird cybernetic post-human world the
[00:00:52] data has become more valuable than gold
[00:00:54] Google and meta are both trillion dollar
[00:00:56] companies built almost exclusively by
[00:00:58] collecting data from users to be
[00:01:00] exploited by advertisers for the last 30
[00:01:02] years humans have voluntarily and
[00:01:04] involuntarily filled the worldwide web
[00:01:06] with exabytes of data about our crappy
[00:01:08] lives and much of this data is freely
[00:01:11] available through the lens of a web
[00:01:12] browser but the problem is that the raw
[00:01:14] data is trapped inside a rock of HTML
[00:01:17] code rendering it useless for data
[00:01:19] analysis the data becomes valuable
[00:01:21] though when it's mined into a clean
[00:01:23] Universal format like Json or CSV that
[00:01:25] can be fed into machine learning tools
[00:01:27] like XG boost or sold to data Brokers on
[00:01:29] on the black market and that's where web
[00:01:31] scraping comes in I've made tutorials
[00:01:33] about how to do it at an industrial
[00:01:34] scale using tools like Puppeteer which
[00:01:37] can render the content on a website
[00:01:38] programmatically click on buttons fill
[00:01:40] out forms and ultimately extract
[00:01:42] valuable data despite content being
[00:01:44] freely available like Amazon product
[00:01:46] listings for example many website owners
[00:01:49] don't like to be scraped and forbid this
[00:01:50] behavior in their terms of service and
[00:01:52] robots.txt file but this file is like
[00:01:55] the no smoking signs on an airplane it
[00:01:57] doesn't actually stop anything from
[00:01:58] happening and you can easily enjoy a
[00:02:00] cigarette on a plane just like the good
[00:02:02] old days however the flight attendant
[00:02:03] might come over to you and tell you to
[00:02:05] stop doing that and ban you from the
[00:02:07] airline website owners can do the same
[00:02:09] thing by Banning your IP address if they
[00:02:12] suspect you're a scraper now to bypass
[00:02:14] this ban a smoker can change his
[00:02:16] identity reboard the plane and take a
[00:02:18] few more drags web scrapers can do the
[00:02:20] same thing by rotating their IP
[00:02:22] addresses via residential proxy networks
[00:02:24] making it look like the traffic is
[00:02:26] coming from normal people around the
[00:02:27] world but this brings up some pretty
[00:02:29] deep moral and ethical concerns on one
[00:02:32] hand the data is freely available and
[00:02:34] it's not exactly theft because the
[00:02:35] website owner hasn't lost anything it
[00:02:37] just like piracy is not theft not
[00:02:39] everyone agrees with this philosophy
[00:02:41] though one could argue that exploiting
[00:02:43] someone else's data for profit could
[00:02:45] violate that person's copyrights in the
[00:02:47] case of booking versus ryion a booking
[00:02:49] was not only scraping the website but
[00:02:51] also reselling ryion a tickets for a
[00:02:53] profit without their authorization Not
[00:02:55] only was there web scraping going on but
[00:02:57] also the intent to defraud now if you're
[00:02:59] a scraper the law you'll want to talk to
[00:03:01] your lawyer about is the Computer Fraud
[00:03:03] and Abuse Act or cfaa which was enacted
[00:03:06] all the way back in 1986 in 2015 a
[00:03:09] company called three Taps was scraping
[00:03:11] data from Craig's List for a website
[00:03:12] called padmapper Craig was not too happy
[00:03:15] about this and blocked their IP
[00:03:16] addresses and sent a seasoned assist
[00:03:18] letter but the company continued to
[00:03:20] scrape until they were sued the court
[00:03:22] cited with Craigslist and set the
[00:03:23] president that online host can use the
[00:03:25] cfaa to protect public data ultimately
[00:03:28] three Taps agreed to never scrape cig
[00:03:30] again and pay $1 million the bottom line
[00:03:32] is that if a company tells you to stop
[00:03:34] scraping you have to stop or you could
[00:03:36] be sued but in 2019 there was another
[00:03:38] high-profile case highq Labs versus
[00:03:40] LinkedIn they scraped data from LinkedIn
[00:03:43] trying to predict when an employee would
[00:03:44] leave their job and Linkedin also sent
[00:03:46] them a seasoned assist however this time
[00:03:49] the Court ruled in favor of highq
[00:03:50] allowing them to access linkedin's
[00:03:52] public data and that decision was
[00:03:54] ultimately affirmed by the Supreme Court
[00:03:56] and just a couple weeks ago scrapers got
[00:03:58] another big win if you're building an AI
[00:03:59] tool like GitHub co-pilot and scrape a
[00:04:01] bunch of Open Source Code to train it
[00:04:03] you should be good to go this lawsuit
[00:04:05] that says co-pilot ignores the licenses
[00:04:07] and violates the rights of possibly
[00:04:09] millions of software developers was
[00:04:10] dismissed by a judge with prejudice
[00:04:12] which means it can't be refiled and that
[00:04:14] brings us back to our original question
[00:04:16] will I go to jail for scraping a website
[00:04:18] well I'm no lawyer but if you're
[00:04:20] accessing publicly available data and
[00:04:21] not defrauding anyone the chances of
[00:04:23] going to jail are extremely low and the
[00:04:25] only thing to worry about is being sued
[00:04:26] by a mega corporation that cripples you
[00:04:28] financially for the rest of your life
[00:04:30] this has been the code report thanks for
[00:04:31] watching and I will see you in the next
[00:04:33] one
