[00:00:00] no one should put this many hours into
[00:00:04] work this is not good
[00:00:09] people should not work this hard i'm not
[00:00:11] they should not do this this is
[00:00:12] very painful painful in what sense
[00:00:16] it's because my ears my brain and my
[00:00:18] heart
[00:00:19] so it's this is not recommended for
[00:00:23] anyone
[00:00:23] i just did it because if i didn't do it
[00:00:26] then tesla
[00:00:27] your chances would die
[00:00:32] when my brother and i were starting our
[00:00:33] first company
[00:00:35] instead of getting an apartment we just
[00:00:37] rented a small office
[00:00:38] and we slept on the couch and we
[00:00:41] showered at the ymca and
[00:00:44] uh we're so hot up we had just one
[00:00:46] computer so
[00:00:48] the website was up during the day and i
[00:00:51] was coding at night
[00:00:53] seven days a week all the time
[00:00:56] and i uh sort of briefly had a
[00:00:58] girlfriend in that period and in order
[00:01:00] to
[00:01:01] be with me she had to sleep in the
[00:01:02] office so
[00:01:04] i work hard like
[00:01:07] in it i mean every waking hour that's
[00:01:09] that's the
[00:01:10] thing i would i would say if you're
[00:01:12] particularly if you're starting a
[00:01:13] company
[00:01:15] and i mean if you do simple math say
[00:01:17] like okay if somebody else is working 50
[00:01:19] hours and you're working 100
[00:01:21] you'll get twice as done as much done in
[00:01:23] the course of a year as
[00:01:24] the other company i mean tesla really
[00:01:26] faced the severe
[00:01:28] threat threat of death due to the model
[00:01:31] 3 production ramp
[00:01:32] essentially the company was bleeding
[00:01:34] money like crazy and
[00:01:35] and just if we didn't solve these
[00:01:38] problems a very short period of time uh
[00:01:40] we would die
[00:01:41] and it was extremely difficult to solve
[00:01:43] them how close to death did you come
[00:01:45] we are within single-digit weeks
[00:01:49] 22 hours a day like what how many hours
[00:01:51] working yeah seven days a week
[00:01:52] sleeping in the factory i worked
[00:01:55] everywhere from the i worked in the
[00:01:56] boats in the paint shop
[00:01:57] general assembly body shop do you ever
[00:01:59] worry about yourself
[00:02:00] imploding like just too much absolutely
[00:02:05] if you're creating company or if you're
[00:02:06] joining a company uh
[00:02:08] the most important thing is to attract
[00:02:11] is to attract great people so either you
[00:02:13] would join a group that's
[00:02:15] amazing that you really respect or if
[00:02:18] you're
[00:02:18] building a company you've got to gather
[00:02:19] great people i mean all the company is
[00:02:21] is a group of people
[00:02:22] that have gathered together to create a
[00:02:23] product or service and so depending upon
[00:02:26] how talented and hardworking that group
[00:02:28] is and the degree to which they are
[00:02:29] focused
[00:02:30] uh cohesively in a good direction
[00:02:33] that will determine the success of the
[00:02:34] company so
[00:02:36] do everything you can to to gather great
[00:02:38] people if you're
[00:02:40] creating a company it's good to think in
[00:02:42] terms of the physics approach for first
[00:02:44] principles
[00:02:45] which is rather than reasoning by
[00:02:48] analogy
[00:02:49] you boil things down to the most
[00:02:51] fundamental truths you can imagine and
[00:02:53] you reason up from there
[00:02:55] and this is a good way to figure out if
[00:02:59] if something really makes sense or if
[00:03:01] it's just
[00:03:02] what everybody else is doing um
[00:03:06] it's hard to think that way you can't
[00:03:07] think think that way about everything
[00:03:09] it takes a lot of effort but if you're
[00:03:12] trying to do something new
[00:03:13] it's the best way to think and that
[00:03:15] framework was developed
[00:03:16] by biophysicists to figure out
[00:03:19] counter-intuitive things
[00:03:20] [Music]
[00:03:22] like quantum mechanics so it's really a
[00:03:24] powerful
[00:03:25] powerful method
[00:03:26] [Music]
[00:03:30] that interests you have to apply a lot
[00:03:31] of hours to actual working
[00:03:33] actually working so the way i generally
[00:03:35] do it is i'll be
[00:03:36] [Music]
[00:03:38] working at spacex on monday and then
[00:03:42] monday night flight to the bay area uh
[00:03:45] spent tuesday
[00:03:47] and wednesday at the bay area then at
[00:03:50] tesla and then
[00:03:51] fly back on wednesday night spent
[00:03:53] thursday and friday
[00:03:54] at spacex um in in
[00:03:57] the last several months then i would fly
[00:03:59] back here on a saturday
[00:04:01] and either spend saturday and sunday at
[00:04:03] tesla
[00:04:05] or spend saturday at tesla and sunday at
[00:04:08] spacex
[00:04:09] just showing up is half the battle just
[00:04:11] you know
[00:04:12] you got to try hard to do it and don't
[00:04:14] be afraid of failure um
[00:04:16] you also need to be rooted in reality um
[00:04:18] so you shouldn't
[00:04:20] it's easy to get high in your own supply
[00:04:22] you've got to
[00:04:23] not be afraid to innovate but also don't
[00:04:25] delude yourself into thinking
[00:04:26] something's working when it's not
[00:04:28] um or you're gonna get fixated on a bad
[00:04:31] solution yeah don't be afraid of new
[00:04:32] arenas uh you know you can get a book
[00:04:34] you can learn something
[00:04:35] um and and experiment with your hands
[00:04:38] and you know just
[00:04:39] make it happen find a way or make way to
[00:04:41] get something done i think people can
[00:04:43] choose to be not ordinary
[00:04:45] you know they they they can choose to
[00:04:47] not necessarily
[00:04:48] conform to the conventions that were
[00:04:52] taught to them by their parents
[00:04:55] so yes i think i think it's possible for
[00:04:57] ordinary people
[00:04:58] to choose to be extraordinary
[00:05:05] if somebody is doing something that is
[00:05:07] useful to
[00:05:09] the rest of society i think that's a
[00:05:10] good thing like it doesn't have to
[00:05:12] change the world like
[00:05:13] you know um if you're doing something
[00:05:15] that has high value to people
[00:05:17] it has a small amount of good uh for a
[00:05:20] large number of people
[00:05:21] um that's i mean i think that's that's
[00:05:23] fine like
[00:05:24] stuff doesn't need to change the world
[00:05:26] just to be good being focused on
[00:05:28] something
[00:05:29] that you're confident will have high
[00:05:31] value to someone else
[00:05:33] and just being really rigorous in making
[00:05:35] that assessment
[00:05:36] um because people are attend tend to
[00:05:40] natural human tendency is wishful
[00:05:41] thinking
[00:05:43] so a challenge for entrepreneurs is to
[00:05:45] say well what's the difference between
[00:05:47] really believing in your ideals and
[00:05:49] sticking sticking to them
[00:05:51] versus pursuing some unrealistic dream
[00:05:54] that
[00:05:54] doesn't actually have merit and it's
[00:05:56] it's that is it that is a really
[00:05:58] difficult thing to
[00:05:59] to tell you can you tell the difference
[00:06:00] between those two things right now so
[00:06:02] you need to be sort of
[00:06:03] very rigorous um in yourself self
[00:06:06] analysis
[00:06:07] um i think certainly extremely tenacious
[00:06:10] uh and um and then just
[00:06:13] work like hell i mean you just have to
[00:06:15] put in
[00:06:16] you know 80 hour 80 to 100 hour weeks
[00:06:20] every week
[00:06:20] but all those things improve the odds of
[00:06:22] success okay um
[00:06:24] i mean if if other people are putting in
[00:06:26] 40 hour work weeks and you're putting in
[00:06:28] 100 hour work weeks then even if
[00:06:32] uh you're doing the same thing you know
[00:06:34] that in
[00:06:35] in one year you will achieve what they
[00:06:36] achieve you will achieve
[00:06:39] in four months what it takes them a year
[00:06:42] to achieve
[00:06:46] you construct this like this is a great
[00:06:48] holy grail potential in the future
[00:06:50] um you have to stay grounded in the
[00:06:52] short term so you know
[00:06:53] because if you don't do things that pay
[00:06:54] the bills you're not going to have
[00:06:57] you're not going to achieve the often
[00:06:58] long-term objective but it's nice to
[00:07:00] have that sort of
[00:07:01] holy grail long-term potential out there
[00:07:04] as
[00:07:04] an inspiration for for coming to work
[00:07:07] it's really a mindset you have to decide
[00:07:09] we're going to try to do things
[00:07:11] differently well provided that they're
[00:07:13] better you shouldn't do things
[00:07:14] differently just because they're
[00:07:15] different they need to be different and
[00:07:16] better
[00:07:17] um but i think you just have to sort of
[00:07:19] decide let's
[00:07:20] let's think beyond the normal stuff and
[00:07:23] and um
[00:07:25] and and have an environment where that
[00:07:26] sort of thinking is encouraged
[00:07:28] and rewarded um
[00:07:31] and where it's okay to fail as well
[00:07:33] because when you try new things
[00:07:35] you try this idea that idea well a large
[00:07:38] number of them are not going to work
[00:07:40] and that has to be okay if if any if
[00:07:42] every time somebody comes up with an
[00:07:43] idea that has to be successful you're
[00:07:44] not going to get people coming up with
[00:07:46] ideas
[00:07:46] you had that third failure in a row
[00:07:49] did you think i need to pack this in
[00:07:52] never
[00:07:54] why not i don't ever give up i mean
[00:07:58] i'd have to be dead or completely
[00:08:05] incapacitated
