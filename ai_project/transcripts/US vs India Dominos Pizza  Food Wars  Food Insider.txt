US vs India Domino’s Pizza | Food Wars | Food Insider

Transcript:

[00:00:00] from calor count to portion sizes we
[00:00:02] want to find out all the differences
[00:00:04] between dominoes in India and the US
[00:00:07] this is food
[00:00:11] Wars here in India our Domino's Pizzas
[00:00:13] come in three sizes our Domino's Pizza
[00:00:16] comes in four sizes the small 8 in with
[00:00:19] four slices the small 10 in which is six
[00:00:23] slices the medium 10 in with six slices
[00:00:26] the medium 12 in which is 8 slices and
[00:00:31] the large 12 in with eight slices the
[00:00:34] large 14 in which is I don't know 4 8 9
[00:00:39] 16 slices cuz I don't know why they cut
[00:00:41] it this way I didn't ask them to so and
[00:00:44] the extra large 16 in or six
[00:00:50] slices unfortunately our large margarita
[00:00:53] pizza only comes in one crust option
[00:00:55] which is the hand TOS you don't get it
[00:00:57] in pan or in cheese Bust or any other
[00:00:59] kind so I am going to weigh one slice of
[00:01:02] large margarita hand toss pizza to see
[00:01:04] how much it weighs 93 G and I will weigh
[00:01:09] a slice of our hand TOs and our pan to
[00:01:11] compare the weight please note that our
[00:01:15] mediums are the same size as their
[00:01:19] larges that's pretty insane yeah I'm not
[00:01:22] surprised by that at all buddy hand toss
[00:01:25] one random slice is 79 G a slice a pan
[00:01:33] same surface size we'll say but
[00:01:36] obviously a lot thicker like wa I mean
[00:01:38] come
[00:01:39] on H
[00:01:42] 139 G so that's a little less than
[00:01:46] double this is our large Domino's
[00:01:49] Margarita Pizza it's also known as the
[00:01:52] plain or cheese in the US this is 12 in
[00:01:55] long it costs 419 rupees or 5.55
[00:01:59] at current conversion rates so the total
[00:02:02] surface area of this pizza is 729.1 cm
[00:02:06] square which means it cost 0.76 cents
[00:02:10] per square cm of this pizza take our
[00:02:13] large 14-in pizza which is 13.99 or 1,56
[00:02:18] Indian rupee with an area of
[00:02:22] 93.1 squar CM just like these slices are
[00:02:25] squared I totally did that on purpose
[00:02:27] that's 1.4 per square cm that means the
[00:02:32] Indian Pizza is 45% cheaper than the
[00:02:36] American
[00:02:38] version this is everything you'll get on
[00:02:41] a menu at Domino's India that you will
[00:02:42] not get in America a literal skyscrapers
[00:02:46] you guys have actual skyscrapers we have
[00:02:49] Domino's Pizza Box skyscrapers here's
[00:02:51] everything at the US Domino's you can't
[00:02:54] get in India we have five 10 we have
[00:02:58] five different crust options we have pan
[00:03:01] then you have Wheat Thin Crust cheese
[00:03:05] burst is there supposed to be cheese in
[00:03:07] here
[00:03:08] oh there is cheese in here for sure then
[00:03:12] we have hand TOs and we have something
[00:03:15] called new hand TOS maybe somebody
[00:03:18] else's hands were used to make this one
[00:03:21] in the US our dominoes has five crust
[00:03:23] options this one right here gluten-free
[00:03:25] but you can only get that as a small
[00:03:26] pizza next over here hand toss over here
[00:03:29] the much thicker pan that's medium only
[00:03:33] this guy in the middle here is the
[00:03:34] crunchy thin which I just found out 5
[00:03:37] seconds ago they also cut in squares
[00:03:39] didn't know that last and certainly not
[00:03:41] least this is the Brooklyn style they're
[00:03:44] thin slices but you only get this in the
[00:03:46] large and the extra large hell yeah that
[00:03:49] looks so good just by looking at them I
[00:03:52] can tell that the hand toss is slightly
[00:03:56] thinner M new hand TOs
[00:04:02] it's a little firmer as a crust I would
[00:04:04] opt for the regular hand toss pizza
[00:04:07] finally just for fun the cheese
[00:04:11] burst that is such a guilty pleasure so
[00:04:14] I thought this was cheese burst in the
[00:04:16] sense that just the outer ring of crust
[00:04:17] had cheese the entire Pizza base is
[00:04:21] cheese burst all right here is our range
[00:04:24] of vegetarian pizzas here in India to
[00:04:27] keep with the religious Sentiments of
[00:04:28] both Hindus and Muslims who are a
[00:04:30] majority in our country we avoid using
[00:04:33] beef and pork in most fast food
[00:04:35] restaurants but what that means is that
[00:04:36] we get a lot of delicious you know
[00:04:38] vegetarian options number one Mexican
[00:04:41] Green Wave I will say the colors on this
[00:04:44] pizza definitely look like the Mexican
[00:04:46] flag alpen some tomatoes onion cheese
[00:04:50] next up we have veggie Paradise wow
[00:04:54] imagine calling an entire Pizza a
[00:04:56] paradise red peppers capsicum olives
[00:04:59] corn and cheese you guys in the comments
[00:05:02] let me know does this look like paradise
[00:05:04] to you I'm not in the comments but I'll
[00:05:06] tell you right now it absolutely does
[00:05:07] not it's funny their veggie Paradise is
[00:05:10] my pizza hell next up Deluxe veggie
[00:05:14] mushrooms paner corn capsicum and
[00:05:18] [Music]
[00:05:20] onion I typically don't like when
[00:05:22] there's too much on my pizza but the
[00:05:24] things are really complement each other
[00:05:25] pretty good but again there's so much
[00:05:27] going on in this it's truly a Delux
[00:05:30] Pizza next up we have peepe paneer how
[00:05:33] fun red peppers capsicum and paneer if
[00:05:37] you are wondering what paneer is it's
[00:05:39] basically cottage cheese and we love our
[00:05:44] paneer okay next up we have paneer Mak
[00:05:47] if you're wondering what Mak means it's
[00:05:49] a paneer version of butter chicken if
[00:05:51] you're wondering what butter chicken is
[00:05:53] friend you need uh culinary
[00:05:57] education h would I ever want paner Mak
[00:06:01] on a pizza maybe not I don't like it
[00:06:03] next up we have cheese and corn it's got
[00:06:06] cheese it's got corn and finally Indie
[00:06:09] paneer tanduri Pizza tandur is basically
[00:06:13] an oven we use here it's cylindrical we
[00:06:15] use wood fire and coal in it to sort of
[00:06:17] give uh the meat and bread some CH to it
[00:06:20] and Indie well this pizza has just not
[00:06:22] hit mainstream
[00:06:24] yet oh that is spicy and a half if you
[00:06:29] can't take heat avoid this one my
[00:06:32] favorites so far none of them I will
[00:06:34] order a non-w pizza wow India has a lot
[00:06:38] more vegetarian options than we do and
[00:06:40] good for them I personally don't want
[00:06:42] any of that we do have two of our own
[00:06:44] exclusive veggie options this here is
[00:06:47] the Pacific Veggie and over here we have
[00:06:50] the spinach INF feta I don't want to try
[00:06:53] either of these do I have to it's a
[00:06:56] wasting valuable stomach space you know
[00:06:59] like it's only so big all this awesome
[00:07:01] Domino's food here I think I want any of
[00:07:03] this in my stomach who cares all right
[00:07:06] fine what got like Feta cheese on it
[00:07:08] this isn't so
[00:07:10] bad nonvegetarian Pizzas number one we
[00:07:14] have the pepper barbecue doesn't look
[00:07:16] like it has any vegetables just a bunch
[00:07:19] of chicken pieces and with a nice Smoky
[00:07:22] Barbecue flavor but you can choose a
[00:07:25] Peppa barbecue chicken with
[00:07:28] onion that is is a great combination
[00:07:31] chicken sausage quite quite sausy for
[00:07:33] sure the next Pizza is what I believe to
[00:07:36] be the best pizza you can order from
[00:07:38] Domino's India the chicken Golden
[00:07:41] Delight what a delightful name this is
[00:07:44] one of the oldest pizzas that's been
[00:07:46] there on the Domino's India menu it's
[00:07:48] got nice sweet corn it's got some alapo
[00:07:51] in there and some delicious delightful
[00:07:55] chicken next we have the Dominator which
[00:07:59] seems to have every single meat topping
[00:08:03] option on the menu my
[00:08:07] god consider me dominated I don't think
[00:08:10] he I don't think he knows what that
[00:08:12] means wow we're learning a lot about
[00:08:14] nille today aren't we whatever you know
[00:08:17] my man and next we have chicken fiesta
[00:08:19] it's got some tanduri chicken pieces
[00:08:21] some capsicum onion nice simple flavors
[00:08:24] you can't go wrong with this one and
[00:08:26] finally Indie chicken Tika which is just
[00:08:29] the chicken version of that paneer Pizza
[00:08:31] I had and that one just burnt my lips so
[00:08:34] steer clear of this one if you can't
[00:08:36] handle spice but if you do this is the
[00:08:39] one you should get actually some of
[00:08:40] those look pretty good I'm very
[00:08:41] impressed now here in the US every Pizza

[00:10:55] an entire section called Chicken Lovers
[00:10:58] and they have these four pizzas that
[00:11:00] look absolutely insane they're more
[00:11:03] topping than pizza at this point this
[00:11:05] one is called the chicken five Feast so

[00:11:11] ticka chicken

[00:11:23] double chicken it has two different
[00:11:25] types of chicken Peppa chicken and
[00:11:27] tanduri chicken and I assume it will be
[00:11:28] spicy and I'm going to take Domino's
[00:11:30] word for it and then we have chicken
[00:11:34] Maximus which sounds like a Roman
[00:11:36] Emperor who is also a
[00:11:38] cover um they have chicken sausage
[00:11:42] chicken Tika just a lot of chicken just
[00:11:44] a lot of chicken that's that's what this
[00:11:46] has like oh my God can I just weigh this
[00:11:50] it feels like a a small baby I'm holding
[00:11:52] a small baby
[00:11:55] 545 G for a medium pizza and Fin finally
[00:11:59] we have what appears to be the king of
[00:12:02] all of these chicken lover pizzas it's
[00:12:04] an Indo
[00:12:06] Fusion Max sounds like I don't know some
[00:12:10] sort of detergent but uh dude you can't

[00:12:23] point oh my God I feel like a new man
[00:12:27] you have to order this once in your life
[00:12:30] it gives me deep displeasure to announce
[00:12:32] that Domino's India has decided to
[00:12:34] create these monstrosities called Pizza
[00:12:38] Burgers look at this is a burger
[00:12:42] supposed to make this
[00:12:43] noise in Bangalore where I'm from if uh

[00:16:37] standard run ofth the-mill chicken wings
[00:16:39] in a country filled with millions of
