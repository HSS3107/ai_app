Description: How Big is The Universe?

We begin at the familiar blue and green orb we call home and zoom out to explore the vastness of space. From the Moon, our closest cosmic neighbor, to the edges of the observable universe, prepare to be astonished by the sheer scale of everything that exists.

Travel with us as we venture past the Moon, understanding its distance in terms we can grasp. Witness the Sun, not just as a source of light, but as a milestone in the vastness of our solar system. We don't stop there; Mars, Neptune, and the outer reaches of our solar neighborhood await.

Discover the awe-inspiring distances to the Voyager 1 probe, the enigmatic Oort Cloud, and the neighboring star system of Alpha Centauri. As we sail through the Milky Way, understand our position in the grand scheme of things, where our entire history is just a whisper in the cosmic wind.

Our voyage takes us further, to the Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, and the staggering Laniakea Supercluster. We contemplate the Great Attractor's pull and our place in this immense heaven.

Confront the boundaries of the observable universe and ponder the mystery of what lies beyond. This video is not just a journey through space but a journey of perspective. Join us in marveling at the universe's grandeur and our humble place within it.

[00:00:04]  
Earth our home planet a tiny blue dot floating in  
[00:00:14] the immense Cosmic ocean here resides everyone you 
ever knew every human who ever lived every story  
[00:00:21] that was ever told it's where our journey begins 
but as we zoom out beyond our atmosphere past the  
[00:00:28] moon Beyond The Familiar planet and the sun we 
embark on an Epic Quest a quest to grasp the true  
[00:00:35] scale of our universe as we leave Earth's embrace 
the first marker on our Cosmic journey is the moon  
[00:00:43] about 384,000 km away a distance so vast that if 
you were to drive a car at a constant speed of  
[00:00:50] 100 km per hour it would take you over 160 days to 
reach it and from this lunar Vantage Point Earth  
[00:00:59] appears as a a fragile sphere of Blues and greens 
cradled in the black void of space a sight that  
[00:01:06] puts our existence into a humbling perspective 
this is Earth as seen from the Moon as we continue  
[00:01:13] our outward Journey the next Milestone is the 
sun lying approximately one astronomical unit  
[00:01:19] away from Earth this unit equivalent to about 150 
million kilm is the standard measuring stick for  
[00:01:27] distances in our solar system imagine this light 
traveling at an astounding speed of 300,000 km/s  
[00:01:35] takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to Journey 
from the Sun to Earth if you were to travel this  
[00:01:41] distance in a commercial jet flying at 900 km 
hour it would take you about 19 years this immense  
[00:01:49] distance is a stark reminder of the vastness of 
space even within our own solar system the Sun a  
[00:01:57] fiery Behemoth provides life- sustaining energy to 
our planet from this incredible distance venturing  
[00:02:03] beyond our home planet and its solar companion 
the sun we set our sites on Mars our enigmatic red  
[00:02:10] neighbor Mars at its closest approach to Earth 
is about 54.6 million kilm away however this  
[00:02:19] distance can stretch up to 401 million km when 
the two planets are on opposite sides of the sun  
[00:02:26] to put that in perspective traveling to Mars at 
the speed of a commercial jet would take upwards  
[00:02:31] of 50 years this vast expanse of space between 
Earth and Mars has been a significant challenge  
[00:02:37] for space exploration The Rovers and probes we've 
sent to the red planet embark on a journey that  
[00:02:43] is not just far but fraught with complexities due 
to the constantly changing distances and orbital  
[00:02:50] Dynamics as we journey to the outermost reaches 
of our solar system we encounter Neptune the  
[00:02:56] distant ice giant lying roughly 4.5 billion kilm 
from Earth Neptune marks the edge of our solar  
[00:03:04] neighborhood sunlight racing across the vacuum 
of space takes about 4 hours and 15 minutes to  
[00:03:12] reach Neptune from the Sun this staggering 
distance showcases the enormity of our solar  
[00:03:18] system launched in 1977 the Voyager One space 
probe represents Humanity's insatiable curiosity  
[00:03:27] and our desire to explore Beyond known bound 
boundaries as of now Voyager 1 has traveled for  
[00:03:33] over four decades covering a staggering distance 
of more than 22 billion kilometers from Earth it's  
[00:03:39] the farthest human-made object from our planet 
a silent Wanderer in the cosmic sea in 1990 at  
[00:03:46] the suggestion of the renowned astronomer Carl San 
Voyager 1 turned its camera back towards Earth for  
[00:03:53] one final photograph this resulted in the iconic 
pale blue dot image and at a distance of about 6  
[00:04:00] billion kilm from Earth our planet appeared as 
a tiny faint dot in the vastness of space Sean  
[00:04:07] poetically reflected on this image emphasizing 
our responsibility to cherish and preserve our  
[00:04:13] only home a small Speck in the immense Universe At 
the very fringes of our solar system lies the ort  
[00:04:20] Cloud a vast theoretical sphere of icy objects 
this distant cloud is thought to extend up to a  
[00:04:27] staggering 100,000 astronomical units from the 
Sun that's about 1.9 light years a distance so  
[00:04:35] immense that it's on the cusp of interstellar 
space scientists determine the boundary of  
[00:04:40] interstellar space known as the heliopause 
where the sun's solar wind is stopped by the  
[00:04:46] interstellar medium this is where the influence of 
our sun ceases and the vast realm of interstellar  
[00:04:53] space Begins the or Cloud represents the final 
frontier of our solar system a boundary Zone  
[00:05:00] where the sun's influence wanes and the cosmic 
journey into the Galaxy truly begins as we venture  
[00:05:08] beyond the confines of our solar system our next 
point of interest is Alpha centor the closest star  
[00:05:14] system to our sun located about 41.3 trillion km 
away this distance is equivalent to over 276,000  
[00:05:24] astronomical units at such colossal distances the 
AU a measure so convenient within our solar system  
[00:05:32] begins to lose its practicality hence astronomers 
use the Lightyear the distance light travels in  
[00:05:39] one year for Interstellar measurements Alpa 
centu is about 4.4 light years away from us  
[00:05:46] considering our current space travel technology 
a journey to Alpha centor is almost unfathomable  
[00:05:52] for instance the Voyager spacecraft traveling at 
about 17 km/ second would take over 70,000 years  
[00:05:59] to reach this neighboring star system this 
immense distance underscores the vastness of  
[00:06:05] space that separates the stars and highlights the 
challenges of interstellar travel our journey now  
[00:06:11] takes us to the Grand scale of our home galaxy 
The Milky Way spanning about 100,000 light years  
[00:06:17] in diameter this vast spiral galaxy is home to 
hundreds of billions of stars each potentially  
[00:06:24] hosting their own planetary systems within this 
immense structure there's a a tiny sphere known  
[00:06:30] as the human radio bubble extending about a 100 
light years from Earth this bubble represents the  
[00:06:36] farthest extent of human influence in the cosmos 
the reach of our radio and television broadcasts  
[00:06:42] into space beyond this bubble it's as if Humanity 
never existed any civilizations residing in the  
[00:06:49] vast majority of our galaxy would be oblivious 
to our presence given that our signals haven't  
[00:06:54] reached them yet the scale of the Milky Way is 
so vast that our entire recorded history is but  
[00:07:00] a whisper in the Cosmic Wind undetectable Beyond 
this small bubble as we leave the Milky Way we  
[00:07:08] enter the vast almost incomprehensible realm of 
Intergalactic space here galaxies float in the  
[00:07:14] cosmic ocean separated by mindboggling distances 
our galaxy is part of a small Cosmic neighborhood  
[00:07:21] known as the local group a cluster of more than 
50 galaxies spread across approximately 10 million  
[00:07:27] light years the local group is a diverse assembly 
including not just spiral galaxies like the Milky  
[00:07:34] Way and Andromeda but also a multitude of smaller 
dwarf galaxies the distances here are so vast that  
[00:07:41] light from one end of the local group to the other 
would take 10 million years to Traverse this scale  
[00:07:47] dwarfs anything within our own Galaxy underscoring 
the enormity of the universe Intergalactic space  
[00:07:53] is a silent expanse a vast Wilderness between the 
islands of Galactic light in this immense void  
[00:08:00] our galaxy home to our entire history is just 
a tiny Speck among many a single story in the  
[00:08:07] grand Cosmic Library as we extend our Cosmic gaze 
beyond the local group we encounter the Colossal  
[00:08:14] Virgo supercluster an immense collection of Galaxy 
groups and clusters including our own local group  
[00:08:21] encompassing a region of space about 110 million 
light years in diameter or 33 megap parex the  
[00:08:28] Virgo super cluster is a Titanic structure in the 
universe containing thousands of galaxies from at  
[00:08:34] least 100 Galaxy groups and clusters each with 
their own Myriad stars and planets as we journey  
[00:08:42] outward from the Virgo supercluster we arrive 
at an even more staggering Cosmic structure  
[00:08:47] the lanaka supercluster this immense Congregation 
of galaxies which includes the Vergo supercluster  
[00:08:54] and extends over 500 million light years is our 
Galactic home on a grand scale lakia meaning  
[00:09:01] immense Heaven in Hawaiian truly lives up to 
its name containing the mass of 100 million  
[00:09:07] billion Suns lakia is a gravitational Masterpiece 
with Galaxy clusters superclusters and countless  
[00:09:15] celestial bodies Bound in a cosmic web of 
Attraction and motion at the heart of lanaka  
[00:09:21] Lies the great attractor a mysterious region 
of space that exerts a massive gravitational  
[00:09:27] pull on the galaxies within this super cluster 
in this vast expanse our Milky Way the entire  
[00:09:34] local group and even the Virgo supercluster are 
just tiny components of this gigantic structure  
[00:09:40] lanak Kia provides a profound context for our 
existence in this immense supercluster we are  
[00:09:47] part of something far greater and more Majestic 
than we can fully comprehend as we reach the  
[00:09:53] boundaries of our Cosmic exploration we encounter 
the limits of the observable universe an Aston  
[00:09:59] astronomical Marvel stretching about 93 billion 
light years in diameter this begs a fascinating  
[00:10:05] question if the universe is only 13.8 billion 
years old how can it be so vast the answer lies  
[00:10:13] in the nature of cosmic expansion the universe has 
been expanding since the Big Bang stretching space  
[00:10:19] and increasing distances between celestial bodies 
but what lies beyond the observable universe this  
[00:10:26] remains one of the greatest mysteries of cosm 
ology some regions of space are expanding away  
[00:10:32] from us faster than the speed of light placing 
them forever out of our view consequently the  
[00:10:39] true size of the entire universe remains unknown 
and potentially infinite the observable universe  
[00:10:46] vast as it is might just be a tiny fragment 
of the entire Cosmic expanse we are left  
[00:10:52] with the humbling realization that there might 
always be regions of space entire galaxies and  
[00:10:58] wonders that we will never witness as they Retreat 
endlessly into the depths of the ever expanding
[00:11:04] universe
