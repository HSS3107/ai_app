[00:00:00] So after three months of the launch,
we only gathered about 200 users.
[00:00:04] However, only seven months
after we launched the product,
[00:00:07] we see so many users saying like,
I want to pay to jump over the queue
[00:00:10] I want to pay to get a higher resolution.
[00:00:12] I want to pay for more downloads,
I want to pay for more credits.
[00:00:15] And by the end of 2023,
we had nearly 10 million ARR as well
[00:00:19] as 5 million user signups.
[00:00:21] But for the live streaming tool,
we didn't save any time.
[00:00:23] We didn't really help them
make more money.
[00:00:25] If you can't make more money
or save time for your users,
[00:00:29] they just feel like it's a cool product.
[00:00:30] It's cool from look and feel,
but not from a business perspective.
[00:00:34] A product market fit is probably something
that you see users are
[00:00:38] Hi, I'm Young, I'm the co-founder
and the CEO at OpusClip, so we.
[00:00:42] OpusClip turns your long form video
footage into social, engaging short video
[00:00:47] clips in just one click that saves
about over 99% of your time and resources
[00:00:53] and expertise of social video production.
[00:00:56] We've gathered user signups,
supports and trust from over 5
[00:01:00] million creators and businesses worldwide.
[00:01:07] You can probably see that people who
create social apps are really introverts.
[00:01:11] They can't socialize in real life in real
person, so they have to figure out another
[00:01:16] hacky way to socialize with people.
[00:01:18] Especially, I want to socialize
with people when I'm not sober.
[00:01:21] I co-founded a social app company
that was called Sober.
[00:01:24] So the name you can tell is that
after you drink, how you want to socialize
[00:01:27] with other people, right?
[00:01:28] We raised about $1.5 million back in 2013.
[00:01:32] However, unluckily, that was just two
months before Snapchat was launched.
[00:01:36] We shared a very similar concept
that all the friendship
[00:01:39] and all the content will disappear
in a few seconds or in just a day.
[00:01:42] The company definitely failed
after a year.
[00:01:44] However, I really enjoyed being an
entrepreneur through that experience.
[00:01:48] I think in the early stage
when people become an entrepreneur is
[00:01:52] probably driven by solving their own needs
and trying to expand that solution
[00:01:57] to more people, right?
[00:01:58] I think people who want to be an
entrepreneur in the early days, by nature,
[00:02:02] are people who want to impact more people,
impact the society and impact the world.
[00:02:06] So back in early 2015,
I went to China with a couple
[00:02:10] other friends from Silicon Valley.
[00:02:11] At that time, the popular trend was
to copy the successful business models
[00:02:15] from the US to China,
[00:02:16] and we discovered a pretty cool business
model from Toast that helped restaurants
[00:02:19] speed up everything all
the way from POS to MarTech to HR tech.
[00:02:23] However, it didn't really turn out well
because of the completely different
[00:02:28] landscape and ecosystem.
[00:02:30] But throughout the journey that we
realized, we are actually the helper
[00:02:33] for the local restaurant
and we should not only build a software,
[00:02:36] but also services whenever needed.
[00:02:39] So I quickly formed a talent agency
focused on Food Review, just actually
[00:02:43] four months after TikTok was launched.
[00:02:45] I know that short video can redefine
how people market themselves, and we
[00:02:49] recognize the huge opportunity out there.
[00:02:51] I spent about four years
expanding that agency.
[00:02:54] We had about nearly 500
creatives in the team.
[00:02:57] After running the agency
for about four years, we realized that all
[00:03:01] the top talents left us because all
of them want to be a solopreneur.
[00:03:05] It is pretty easy and intuitive
for a super creative person
[00:03:09] to become a solopreneur.
[00:03:10] They want to create content
for themselves,
[00:03:12] not for some local restaurants.
[00:03:14] So I thought about it.
[00:03:15] Instead of managing these creatives
directly in my team,
[00:03:19] why don't I build some AI powered product
that can enable all of the creators?
[00:03:25] There must be an AI solution
that can automate as much as possible
[00:03:29] and remove the pain for creating contents.
[00:03:32] Because I was running the business,
I know how painful it is.
[00:03:35] All the successful entrepreneurs
have some sort of altruism.
[00:03:38] They want to help others.
[00:03:40] It is pretty straightforward
that they can get benefit.
[00:03:43] The benefit is not commercial.
[00:03:45] It's not business, but it's more
spiritual benefit from helping others.
[00:03:55] So the first product idea we came about
is AI powered live streaming tool.
[00:03:59] So that was during the pandemic
and everyone is working from home
[00:04:03] and watching live streaming content.
[00:04:05] So we founded the company
back in January 2022.
[00:04:08] We spent about half a year building the
live streaming product with all sorts of
[00:04:12] cool AI features like AI generated memes,
AI populated interactions, and so on.
[00:04:18] We realized that it is not solving
any real pain points.
[00:04:22] So after three months of the launch,
we only gathered about 200 users.
[00:04:27] So these 200 users,
we actually spend a lot of effort.
[00:04:30] We want them to continuously use
Opus Studio to give us feedback,
[00:04:35] but none of them is willing to do so.
[00:04:37] So we paid them like $20, $30 a session
to use our product
[00:04:41] so that we can gather the feedback.
[00:04:43] But after we stopped paying
for the stipend, none of them is
[00:04:46] continuously using the product.
[00:04:48] However, the last feature we built
for the AI powered live streaming product
[00:04:52] was a clipping feature
because a lot of users keep asking us
[00:04:56] that after the live streaming,
[00:04:57] we want to repurpose the content
so that we can reuse for distribution.
[00:05:03] So we added a feature that during your
live streaming, you can hit the button
[00:05:07] and we will add a mark.
[00:05:09] And after the live streaming
content is ready,
[00:05:11] we can deliver the clips for you directly.
[00:05:14] And also we use some other AI
to recognize the cool moments.
[00:05:18] That was the only feature
that these 200 users liked.
[00:05:22] They say all the other stuff are nonsense.
It doesn't help.
[00:05:26] How can I only use this feature?
[00:05:28] So we decided to turn the feature
into a standalone product.
[00:05:32] And amazingly, in just two weeks, tens of
thousands of users sign up for OpusClip
[00:05:37] And by the end of 2023,
we had nearly 10 million ARR,
[00:05:40] as well as 5 million user sign ups.
[00:05:42] And that was only seven months
after we launched the product.
[00:05:45] The real product market fit
comes from people who are
[00:05:49] really willing to pay for it.
[00:05:51] When we launched Opus Studio,
we asked the user during the interviews,
[00:05:55] like how much you want to pay for them
and they're too shy to give us an answer.
[00:05:59] They were like, I will probably think
about it or something like that, right?
[00:06:04] So you can know that they don't have
any dedication or commitment
[00:06:08] to pay for the product, but for open clip,
we see so many users saying like,
[00:06:12] I want to pay to jump over the queue.
I want to pay to get a higher resolution.
[00:06:15] I want to pay for more downloads,
I want to pay for more credits.
[00:06:18] We didn't have the payment setup
on day one, but so many users just came in
[00:06:23] to knock on our door and email us
and calling us even because we
[00:06:26] really saved tens of hours for them.
[00:06:29] But for the live streaming tool,
we didn't save any time.
[00:06:31] We didn't really help them
make more money.
[00:06:34] If you can't make more money
or save time for your users,
[00:06:37] they just feel like it's a cool product.
[00:06:39] It's cool from look and feel,
but not from a business perspective.
[00:06:43] In the era of AI,
there are definitely way more teams
[00:06:47] great at technologies, then teams
great at building a product market fit.
[00:06:53] They believe they have a really
strong technology through like
[00:06:55] a paper through academic research,
but the user really want it.
[00:06:59] So I think definitely start with
what the user wants, stay with your user,
[00:07:02] or even try to become a user.
[00:07:04] And then think about whether your
technology is the best solution,
[00:07:09] whether AI is the best solution.
[00:07:11] So many AI products that can deliver over
100% of quality at times, but also really
[00:07:16] under deliver really disappointed users.
[00:07:19] So I think from a user experience
perspective, how you manage your
[00:07:22] user expectations is really tricky.
[00:07:24] Once AI delivers some results,
can user touch up on that?
[00:07:28] So that's why we spend a lot of our
resources building some manual features.
[00:07:33] That comes after the AI first approach,
which means once I deliver the result,
[00:07:37] if the user think is 80% perfect,
they can still continue the workflow
[00:07:41] from what we generate for the user.
[00:07:43] This is going to really
completely solve a user problem.
[00:07:47] Because you are building a product,
you are solving a business problem
[00:07:50] that eventually has to be 100% resolved.
[00:07:53] AI if AI can only do 80%,
you have to make sure the other 20%
[00:07:57] can be well handled by human hands.
[00:08:00] Right now at OpusClip
we launch new feature every single week.
[00:08:03] That is one of our culture
and that is one of the trend.
[00:08:06] Users love our product.
[00:08:08] They see opusclip not only
the current product, but how fast we out.
[00:08:12] Iterate the market by launching
new features every single week,
[00:08:15] making sure you experiment extensively
before launching an AI product.
[00:08:21] Because AI is not so controllable
nowadays, the result can be versatile,
[00:08:26] can go beyond even your expectation.
[00:08:29] I see most of the AI features
or AI products.
[00:08:31] Start with like a lab, start with a beta
version, and after quite a few more months
[00:08:36] when it is really stable,
when the cost really came down,
[00:08:39] then it becomes part of a core product.
[00:08:41] Don't spend too much time
building an AI core product.
[00:08:46] Try to launch it separately,
try to launch some small experiments,
[00:08:50] and get early users feedback
before cutting down the cost.
[00:08:54] Before integrating that
into your main product.
[00:08:57] And our product is also very unique
in terms of user feedback
[00:09:01] is that the user not only directly give us
feedback through using the product,
[00:09:05] but also once they post a video
from our product to the social medias,
[00:09:09] we can gather the number of user views,
the number of comments, number
[00:09:13] of favorites, and number of reshares.
[00:09:15] So all these, what we call audience
feedback is actually ten times or even 100
[00:09:20] times more than our user direct feedback.
[00:09:23] And we're going to use these amount of
feedback to fit into our model training,
[00:09:27] so that we can judge whether we
are generating a good video clip
[00:09:32] even before the user publish
to the social media channels.
[00:09:40] So our vision is to enable anyone
to become a creator
[00:09:44] without the effort and hassle
of video editing and prompting skills.
[00:09:49] We don't want an AI
to remove the human authenticity.
[00:09:52] We want humans to focus
and spend more time on creating an idea.
[00:09:56] Create your script.
[00:09:57] Film the relevant contents and then we
OpusClip will take over all the boring
[00:10:03] and tedious and time consuming work.
[00:10:05] So there are in general,
from video production perspective,
[00:10:08] there are three major stages.
[00:10:10] The first one is pre-production,
where you edit a topic, you write the
[00:10:15] scripts and you prepare the storyboard,
[00:10:17] and then it comes to the production
where you film the content, you record the
[00:10:21] screen, or you prepare the media assets.
[00:10:24] The last one is the post-production,
right where you edit the video,
[00:10:27] you assemble, you cut the scenes
and you sequence them in order.
[00:10:32] Previously, most of the AI or technology
is only focusing on a specific scene
[00:10:37] or a specific frame.
[00:10:39] But nowadays the overall story,
the overall narration and the curation
[00:10:43] can be well enhanced and automated by AI.
The second thing is definitely
[00:10:47] the generative AI technologies.
[00:10:49] We can see that most of the time
it's really hard to feel the content.
[00:10:53] But nowadays with Sora, with Pika,
with other AI models, you can
[00:10:57] generate like a few seconds long footage
or B-roll from just a few words.
[00:11:02] So I think one is the understanding,
the other is the generation.
[00:11:07] These two huge advancement of AI is
actually automating the whole process
[00:11:12] and also generating new footage.
[00:11:13] I think with the advancement
in these AI technologies,
[00:11:17] creators are actually shifting
from creating content to being creative.
[00:11:23] They don't have to spend so much time to
specifically create each piece of content.
[00:11:28] I can do this job for them, but they
should spend probably ten times more time
[00:11:32] to think about how to be creative.
[00:11:34] Because everyone is being
more and more creative.
[00:11:36] Everyone have more time
to be more creative.
[00:11:39] Everyone have more resources
to be more creative.
[00:11:41] I think the paradigm shift is
how can you be ten times tenfold
[00:11:44] more creative than before?
[00:11:46] I think in the AI era, being authentic
and being genuine is probably going to be
[00:11:53] more of a rare find because it's easy.
[00:11:56] It's super easy to leverage AI
to generate a lot of fabricated content.
[00:12:00] So my advice would be,
just be yourself, be human, be real.
[00:12:05] And, you know, maybe nowadays it's
easy to be like that, but think about 5
[00:12:09] or 10 years later when AI is everywhere,
when AI generated content is everywhere.
[00:12:14] Like being super real, being super genuine
and authentic is probably going
[00:12:20] to help you be the most creative.
