Description: Xbox lost the console war to Nintendo and Sony’s PlayStation, but that doesn’t mean it’s out of the fight. A few years ago, Microsoft launched Game Pass, a subscription service that lets users play Xbox games on devices other than its namesake console. Now, other major tech companies like Nvidia and Amazon are jumping into the subscription gaming world. 

WSJ explains whether Microsoft’s pivot will pay off and what it could mean for the future of the console.

[00:00:00] - [Narrator] This is the Xbox Series X,
[00:00:04] Microsoft's most powerful
flagship console.
[00:00:06] For a long time, you needed an Xbox
[00:00:09] to play games like
"Halo" or "Gears of War".
[00:00:11] Then Microsoft decided you don't.
[00:00:14] So it launched a monthly
subscription service
[00:00:16] that lets users play the
latest games on a bunch
[00:00:19] of other devices, but it's
increasingly competitive
[00:00:23] and will take a lot of
investment to make it work.
[00:00:25] So, will this shift pay off?
[00:00:28] And what does it mean for
the future of the console?
[00:00:31] This is The Economics of Xbox.
[00:00:35] Today, with more than 30 game studios,
[00:00:37] Xbox is an industry mainstay,
[00:00:39] - But it had to really earn
that position in the market.
[00:00:41] - [Narrator] The console
war began in the 1970s
[00:00:44] when video game companies
started competing
[00:00:46] to create a more powerful
console and win more customers.
[00:00:50] By the '90s, the biggest players
[00:00:51] were Sony, Nintendo, and Sega.
[00:00:54] And in 1997, consumer spending on consoles
[00:00:56] surpassed arcades for the first time.
[00:00:59] A few years later,
Microsoft entered the scene
[00:01:02] with its first generation Xbox.
[00:01:04] To entice customers into their ecosystems,
[00:01:06] most of these companies
tried to keep the prices
[00:01:08] on their consoles as low as possible,
[00:01:11] selling them at a loss.
[00:01:13] Xbox loses up to $200 per console,
[00:01:16] but the brands made up the
difference by selling games
[00:01:18] and other accessories.
[00:01:20] - The more consoles you sell,
the more software you're going
[00:01:24] to sell with it.
[00:01:25] - [Narrator] The PlayStation
[00:01:26] outsold the Xbox every single time.
[00:01:29] Microsoft only came close to beating Sony
[00:01:32] with the Xbox 360.
[00:01:33] Analysts say this was
because the PlayStation 3,
[00:01:36] which ran customers up to
$600, was priced too high,
[00:01:40] but the Xbox lost ground
with the next generation,
[00:01:43] and ultimately, it lost the console war.
[00:01:47] In 2017, Xbox launched Game Pass,
[00:01:49] positioning itself as a services brand.
[00:01:52] - It's more interested in
making content available
[00:01:54] to people, whatever device
they choose to play on.
[00:01:57] - [Narrator] Game Pass
is a tiered service.
[00:01:59] The least expensive plans
offer gaming on either console
[00:02:02] or PC, and the most expensive
plan has multi-device gaming
[00:02:06] and other features like
streaming games from the cloud
[00:02:08] and access to certain games
the day they're released.
[00:02:11] In essence, Microsoft is betting
[00:02:13] that it can get more customers
[00:02:14] if they don't have to buy a console.
[00:02:16] This model also gives the company
[00:02:18] a recurring revenue stream,
so it doesn't have to rely
[00:02:21] as much on blockbuster successes.
[00:02:23] - So Game Pass solves the
problem on the consumer side
[00:02:25] by making lots of content
available for cheap,
[00:02:28] and on the business or
the supply side in terms
[00:02:30] of offsetting the financial volatility
[00:02:33] associated with entertainment.
[00:02:34] - [Narrator] Microsoft's
head of gaming, Phil Spencer,
[00:02:36] has said Game Pass is profitable.
[00:02:38] - And I think it will
stay in that 10 to 15%
[00:02:41] of our overall revenue.
[00:02:42] - [Narrator] But Microsoft
isn't the only one
[00:02:44] stepping into the subscription world.
[00:02:46] In 2022, Sony merged its
subscription services,
[00:02:49] PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now,
[00:02:52] and relaunched it to
compete with Game Pass.
[00:02:54] There are two key things
that give Microsoft an edge.
[00:02:57] First, it's a much larger company
[00:02:59] with lots and lots of money.
[00:03:01] And for the past decade, Microsoft
has been using that money
[00:03:04] to acquire game studios,
beefing up its library.
[00:03:07] In 2014, it bought Mojang,
the maker of "Minecraft"
[00:03:10] for $2.5 billion.
[00:03:12] In 2021, it bought ZeniMax Media,
[00:03:15] owner of "Fallout" and
"Doom" for $8.1 billion,
[00:03:19] and in 2023, it finalized the purchase
[00:03:21] of Activision Blizzard,
the maker of "Call of Duty"
[00:03:24] and "Candy Crush" for $75.4 billion.
[00:03:28] - To put it in perspective,
that is a little bit less
[00:03:31] than what Sony makes annually.
[00:03:32] - [Narrator] Second, as
a giant tech company,
[00:03:34] Microsoft owns lots and
lots of data centers,
[00:03:38] over 300 worldwide.
[00:03:39] Some of which help support
Game Pass and cloud gaming.
[00:03:42] - The incumbents like Nintendo and Sony,
[00:03:45] they live and die on great content,
[00:03:47] and this magnificent retail distribution
[00:03:50] infrastructure that they've built.
[00:03:51] So it's in Microsoft's interest
[00:03:53] to push into its data centers
[00:03:56] and its infrastructure in the cloud,
[00:03:58] because it can't beat Sony
and Nintendo at retail.
[00:04:01] - [Narrator] This puts it in an arena
[00:04:03] that mainly other massive tech companies
[00:04:04] like Amazon, Nvidia, and
Google can really compete in,
[00:04:08] but there are lots of obstacles.
[00:04:10] To start, adoption has been slow.
[00:04:12] In 2020, it targeted 71%
subscriber growth and reached 86%,
[00:04:16] but the following year, it fell short.
[00:04:19] And in 2022, it missed
its target by a long shot.
[00:04:22] - Some people are just not comfortable
[00:04:24] with the idea of not
actually owning a game.
[00:04:26] They may wanna play a game,
put it down for six months
[00:04:29] and pick it up later, or
a year later, or more,
[00:04:31] and it may not be in
the subscription service
[00:04:34] anymore after that time.
[00:04:36] - [Narrator] So as of 2024,
[00:04:37] Game Pass has amassed
34 million subscribers.
[00:04:40] Some of the biggest challenges
are specific to cloud gaming.
[00:04:43] A feature included in
Game Pass's top tier.
[00:04:46] Traditionally, game data was
stored locally on cartridges,
[00:04:49] disks, or downloaded
straight to the console.
[00:04:52] With online multiplayer games,
[00:04:54] data like each player's
actions were streamed.
[00:04:57] But with cloud gaming, the
entire game is streamed
[00:04:59] to your device, which can be laggy.
[00:05:01] - If it's a competitive game,
[00:05:02] a millisecond can mean the difference
[00:05:04] between winning and losing.
[00:05:05] - [Narrator] Cloud gaming is
also expensive to operate.
[00:05:08] - The economics have changed,
[00:05:10] but they haven't immediately changed to,
[00:05:13] you know, only run a profit.
[00:05:15] Both of those offerings, whether those
[00:05:16] are product-based and conventional,
[00:05:18] or whether they are
streaming and more digital,
[00:05:21] both of those run at a loss in principle,
[00:05:24] but to recuperate and that to
earn money in those contexts
[00:05:27] is a very different proposition.
[00:05:29] - [Narrator] One report
found that just 6% of gamers
[00:05:31] around the world were subscribed
[00:05:32] to a cloud gaming service in 2023.
[00:05:35] Still, experts believe it
will grow substantially.
[00:05:38] - Cloud gaming is one
of those few components
[00:05:40] where they could possibly thrive and lead,
[00:05:43] even if that's a much more
modestly sized industry.
[00:05:46] - [Narrator] Microsoft isn't getting rid
[00:05:47] of the Xbox anytime soon.
[00:05:49] Later this year, it will
release new versions
[00:05:51] of its current generation,
the series X and S,
[00:05:54] but it's clear that Xbox views
its content as the future
[00:05:57] of the company, not its hardware.
[00:06:00] - It is incredibly difficult
for these large companies,
[00:06:02] in spite of their resources,
to be agile and innovative.
[00:06:06] And so, you know, they're
always watching someone else
[00:06:08] just run the show.
[00:06:10] And so in many ways, you
could make the argument
[00:06:12] that the current effort and
investment towards Game Pass,
[00:06:15] and X Cloud, and all of the
things that they're building
[00:06:18] and acquiring goes towards
perhaps finally being
[00:06:21] in the driver's seat for the first time,
[00:06:23] - [Narrator] Giving it the chance
[00:06:24] to win whatever the
new gaming war will be.
