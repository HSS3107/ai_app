Transcript:

[00:00:00] so I stayed up late last night because I
[00:00:02] discovered bolt. new and I'm being
[00:00:04] sincere when I say this could be the
[00:00:06] vzer cursor AI killer and here's a
[00:00:08] reason why and what better way to
[00:00:10] explain it than to actually PRT it and
[00:00:12] see what it does so build me a website
[00:00:18] for my um car
[00:00:22] detailing business in NEX
[00:00:25] js14 app router now while this is
[00:00:29] cooking a couple things that are
[00:00:30] exciting about bolt is it's just like
[00:00:32] vzer in a sense where it's trained on
[00:00:35] best practices of nextjs it's trained on
[00:00:37] shaty Andi but then it's also like
[00:00:40] cursor AI where I have an editor where I
[00:00:43] can edit the code myself but I also get
[00:00:45] code generation and last but not least
[00:00:48] it's like repet where I can oneclick
[00:00:49] deploy and this deploys to netlify which
[00:00:52] is a great hosting provider but here is
[00:00:56] the amazing part and this is what blew
[00:00:58] me away if you're trying to build a
[00:01:00] feature or something that in requires
[00:01:03] external packages it can be pretty hard
[00:01:05] with uh different AI models and the
[00:01:07] different services but bolt will find
[00:01:11] packages external packages install them
[00:01:15] and Implement them correctly in your
[00:01:17] code base I'm talking n out of 10 times
[00:01:20] it did it perfectly for me and that's
[00:01:22] what blew me away this is what cognition
[00:01:25] AI wants to be where this does your uh
[00:01:30] does what VZ does does what cursor does
[00:01:33] does what repet does but also combines
[00:01:35] all of that cohesively in a great
[00:01:38] environment and mind you I don't even
[00:01:39] think these guys have VC funding yet
[00:01:41] imagine when they get millions of
[00:01:42] dollars how amazing this platform is
[00:01:44] going to be so I was super excited and
[00:01:47] this is why I had to record this video
[00:01:49] so the site is done we see a couple
[00:01:52] things have been done couple Pages have
[00:01:54] been
[00:01:55] made let's look at what it's built for
[00:01:58] us first site here let's click on
[00:02:03] Services okay it made a Services page I
[00:02:06] didn't ask for that let's click on about
[00:02:08] it made an about page I didn't ask for
[00:02:10] that and then it has that next year
[00:02:11] snappiness if I click on home you can
[00:02:13] see that light mode works all right so
[00:02:17] this is what I'm going to do I'm going
[00:02:18] to say when I click on our
[00:02:24] services do not route me to the services
[00:02:29] page
[00:02:30] but please rain confetti now the reason
[00:02:35] why I'm doing this is I want to show you
[00:02:37] how it installs external packages and
[00:02:41] implements them uh within the code base
[00:02:43] and I think that's where this shines and
[00:02:46] as always I don't think this is going to
[00:02:47] replace developers but my fellow
[00:02:48] developers I hope you prototype using
[00:02:51] this this I can see it being fantastic
[00:02:54] now I'm glad this happens sometimes it
[00:02:56] poops on you you just got to hit send
[00:02:58] again and let's let's see what it
[00:03:04] does so it's going to install a package
[00:03:06] called canvas confetti um I would have
[00:03:09] done react confetti but I'm pretty sure
[00:03:11] canvas confetti is just as good let's
[00:03:12] see how this works so my page is live I
[00:03:15] know it's says there's a problem here
[00:03:16] and I can click fix problem but I just
[00:03:18] want to see if it got this right so I'm
[00:03:20] going to click on our
[00:03:21] services and look at that it downloaded
[00:03:24] an external package made it work with my
[00:03:27] existing code codebase and here's the
[00:03:30] best part of it all I can click deploy
[00:03:32] and this will deploy to netlify which if
[00:03:35] I may add is a great hosting provider
[00:03:37] okay so it looks like the build and the
[00:03:39] deployment was done my website is live
[00:03:42] here so I'm going to click on this link
[00:03:44] right now and if I click on our services
[00:03:47] confetti works if I click on Services
[00:03:49] about look how Snappy that is light mode
[00:03:53] it all works and this was what two
[00:03:55] prompts three prompts you can make this
[00:03:57] site way better you can make this um you
[00:04:00] know fancy you can add animations I just
[00:04:02] wanted to share bolt. new with you guys
[00:04:05] so you guys can start playing with it
[00:04:06] right away if I had a couple more
[00:04:08] prompts I could make this site look so
[00:04:11] amazing and have it deployed in minutes
[00:04:14] this is the future take part in it I
[00:04:16] hope you enjoy this video I hope you
