[00:00:00] open AI releases a new deep thinking
[00:00:02] model and this time around it looks like
[00:00:04] my high pay low eff for dep job is
[00:00:06] actually in danger nextjs suffers a
[00:00:08] major image blow and yes you can
[00:00:10] actually become a millionaire from open-
[00:00:12] Source software these are just some of
[00:00:14] the most important Tex stories that we
[00:00:16] need to talk about in this monthly
[00:00:17] update let's start with a quick win that
[00:00:19] open source head over big tech for a bit
[00:00:21] of context back in 2021 elastic search
[00:00:24] license became more restrictive due to
[00:00:26] issues with Cloud providers like AWS
[00:00:29] offering the search engine as a service
[00:00:30] without collaborating with elastic this
[00:00:32] was met with criticism from the open
[00:00:34] source Community to address the concerns
[00:00:37] elastic search got more permissive
[00:00:39] licensing options September also marks
[00:00:41] the release of postgress 17 this is a
[00:00:43] big milestone and the new version
[00:00:45] introduces Major Performance
[00:00:46] enhancements including memory
[00:00:48] optimizations for vacuum processes and
[00:00:50] improved concurrency for high workloads
[00:00:52] it offers new SQL and Json features
[00:00:55] logical replication improvements and
[00:00:57] expanded support for partition tables
[00:00:59] and since we are talking about big
[00:01:01] releases Doo 2 was just announced this
[00:01:03] is the largest update since 1.0 and it
[00:01:06] brings major changes and philosophical
[00:01:07] shifts the release enhances dependency
[00:01:10] management with new commands like Dino
[00:01:12] add and remove while simplifying
[00:01:13] permission handling overall Dino two
[00:01:16] focuses on a better developer experience
[00:01:18] and on a stronger node and mpm
[00:01:20] interoperability on the web dev front
[00:01:22] angular is making a bold move granted we
[00:01:24] all saw this coming since the angular
[00:01:26] team is focusing on modernizing and
[00:01:28] simplifying the dev experience
[00:01:30] Standalone components allow for a more
[00:01:32] modular approach enabling developers to
[00:01:34] write smaller more focused units of code
[00:01:37] view 3.5 was also released and this
[00:01:39] version introduces several enhancements
[00:01:41] with no breaking changes key updates
[00:01:43] include significant performance
[00:01:45] optimizations in the reactivity system
[00:01:47] improved handling of reactive props and
[00:01:49] new serers side rendering features like
[00:01:51] lazy hydration custom elements gain new
[00:01:53] apis and the developer flexibility was
[00:01:56] improved thanks to other various small
[00:01:57] updates in other news open AI introduced
[00:02:00] a new type of AI designed to give more
[00:02:02] thoughtful and detailed answers it works
[00:02:04] by taking a little extra time to think
[00:02:06] before responding aiming to provide
[00:02:08] higher quality more accurate and
[00:02:10] carefully considered outputs these
[00:02:11] improvements are visible in coding as
[00:02:13] well and oan was paired with Devon to
[00:02:15] get big Tech One Step Closer to taking
[00:02:17] our jobs these people from the future
[00:02:19] are showing up and offering to do the
[00:02:21] same work for next to nothing they took
[00:02:23] our jet open AI it's not all bad and in
[00:02:26] September they actually took a stab at
[00:02:28] another industry villain nextjs is by
[00:02:30] far the most widely used meta framework
[00:02:32] and versel has a big say in the future
[00:02:34] of react so open ai's move to dump next
[00:02:37] in favor of remix is a really
[00:02:38] interesting one anyway let's move to
[00:02:40] something we all are interested in money
[00:02:43] in a recent article Caleb shares how he
[00:02:45] hit one million in GitHub sponsors by
[00:02:47] focusing on providing value through
[00:02:49] projects like Livewire and Alpine his
[00:02:51] success came from creating helpful
[00:02:53] educational content engaging with the
[00:02:54] community and building genuine
[00:02:56] relationships so there you have it there
[00:02:59] is hope outside sidea boards tight
[00:03:01] deadlines and endless teams
[00:03:05] meetings back to the JS world after 9
[00:03:08] years of annual JavaScript updates the
[00:03:10] tc39 committee has tweaked the process
[00:03:13] to make rolling out new features faster
[00:03:14] and smoother since JavaScript is so
[00:03:16] widely used a huge number of ideas and
[00:03:19] proposals are submitted to evolve the
[00:03:21] language so in order for all these
[00:03:23] proposals to be discussed and vetted as
[00:03:25] early as possible a new stage zero was
[00:03:27] added in the list of steps each feature
[00:03:29] has to go through in order to be
[00:03:31] included in the egas script standard
[00:03:33] finally Express the popular nodejs web
[00:03:35] framework had a new major release after
[00:03:37] 10 years version five provides native
[00:03:39] support for promises a better way to use
[00:03:41] a syn AA in routes and middleware better
[00:03:44] support for HTTP 2 and improved error
[00:03:46] handling if you find such updates useful
