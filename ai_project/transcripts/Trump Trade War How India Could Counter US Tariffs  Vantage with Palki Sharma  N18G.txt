Transcript:

[00:00:04] from the Battleground in Ukraine to the
[00:00:06] global trade War the one that Donald
[00:00:08] Trump has Unleashed on the world the US
[00:00:10] president has shaken up global trade his
[00:00:13] wide ranging tariff plan has spared a
[00:00:16] range of reactions some countries are
[00:00:18] trying to play it safe trying to
[00:00:20] negotiate in the hope of getting Trump
[00:00:21] to withdraw the tariffs others are
[00:00:24] fighting back like Canada Trump is
[00:00:27] targeting Canadian steel and aluminium
[00:00:30] he has imposed a 25% tariff on them and
[00:00:32] this will hurt because Canada is
[00:00:34] America's biggest supplier of Steel and
[00:00:36] metal the Canadian economy depends on
[00:00:39] these exports so awise hitting back 25%
[00:00:44] reciprocal tariffs on an additional
[00:00:49] 29.8 billion of imports from the United
[00:00:53] States this includes Steel products
[00:00:56] worth 12.6 billion and aluminum products
[00:01:00] worth 3 billion as well as additional
[00:01:03] imported us goods worth
[00:01:06] $14.2 billion for a total of
[00:01:10] $9.8
[00:01:12] billion the foreign Ministers of Canada
[00:01:15] and the US have met talks are underway
[00:01:17] but Canada is also preparing for a
[00:01:19] protracted battle the Canadian Central
[00:01:22] Bank has cut interest rates Trump's
[00:01:24] tariffs could trigger a recession in
[00:01:26] Canada so the central bank is increasing
[00:01:29] the money flow they're hoping to absorb
[00:01:31] some of the shock from these tariffs the
[00:01:33] European Union is taking a similar
[00:01:34] approach they are imposing tit fortat
[00:01:37] tariffs on the
[00:01:38] US Brussels is targeting $28 billion
[00:01:43] worth of American
[00:01:45] Goods stuff like motorcycles peanut but
[00:01:48] peanut butter and
[00:01:50] jeans they're now facing new and higher
[00:01:53] import taxes but the EU has also left
[00:01:55] the door a jar for a potential
[00:01:57] negotiation with Donald Trump
[00:02:00] our Contra measures will be introduced
[00:02:02] in two
[00:02:03] steps starting with April 1st and fully
[00:02:07] in place as of April
[00:02:09] 13th in the meantime we will always
[00:02:12] remain open to
[00:02:14] negotiations we firmly believe that in a
[00:02:18] world fraud with geoeconomic and
[00:02:22] political
[00:02:23] uncertainties it is not in our common
[00:02:26] interest to burden our economies with
[00:02:30] such
[00:02:32] tariffs so both Canada and the EU have
[00:02:35] picked a fight with Trump but the
[00:02:38] strongest response has come from China
[00:02:40] Beijing is not just retaliating on
[00:02:41] tariffs it is going after American
[00:02:44] companies it is singling them out and
[00:02:46] launching investigations into their
[00:02:48] Affairs China's latest Target is Walmart
[00:02:51] the American retail giant Chinese
[00:02:53] authorities summoned Walmart executives
[00:02:56] although Beijing claims that it was just
[00:02:57] a meeting apparently Walmart was
[00:03:00] speaking with supplies in China it
[00:03:02] wanted discounts on its supplies it
[00:03:04] wanted to protect its
[00:03:06] margins and cushion the shock of Trump's
[00:03:09] tariffs and the logic is quite simple if
[00:03:11] the products cost less then the tariffs
[00:03:14] won't really
[00:03:16] matter and this has made Beijing
[00:03:19] Furious here is a quote published by a
[00:03:21] Chinese mouthpiece it says Walmart's
[00:03:24] demand for Chinese suppliers to Bear the
[00:03:26] full tariff burden is unreasonable and
[00:03:29] disrupt Fair competition and
[00:03:31] international trade
[00:03:34] order so China is willing to take the
[00:03:37] fight to trump it is reminding the US
[00:03:39] that these tariffs violate WTO rules the
[00:03:43] rules of the World Trade Organization
[00:03:47] selling both the 301 tariffs and the 232
[00:03:51] tariffs have been ruled by the WTO
[00:03:53] dispute settlement body to violate
[00:03:55] multilateral trade rules the combined
[00:03:57] implementation of these tariffs will
[00:03:59] neither help the so-called National
[00:04:01] Security nor save the domestic
[00:04:03] Industries in the United States it will
[00:04:05] only highlight the unilateralism
[00:04:08] protectionism and bullying nature of the
[00:04:10] US
[00:04:12] measures look at the twist in the tail
[00:04:15] today China is wielding the rule book
[00:04:17] and the US under Donald Trump is the
[00:04:19] rule
[00:04:19] breaker then we have Mexico another
[00:04:22] American neighbor how is Mexico dealing
[00:04:24] with Trump's tariffs their president
[00:04:26] Claudia Shane bom is taking a weit and
[00:04:29] wait and watch approach unlike Canada
[00:04:32] and the EU she did not rush to impose
[00:04:35] retaliatory tariffs Claudia Shane bomb
[00:04:38] wants to negotiate first she has also
[00:04:40] offered
[00:04:41] concessions Trump's biggest complaint
[00:04:44] with Mexico is the Border he says the US
[00:04:46] Mexico border is porous that it leads to
[00:04:48] a large influx of migrants and it has
[00:04:51] led to a rise in crossborder smuggling
[00:04:54] these claims have been contested but the
[00:04:56] Mexican president is taking these
[00:04:57] complaints seriously she's ready to
[00:05:00] deploy 10,000 troops to the Border in
[00:05:02] the hope of appeasing Donald Trump we'll
[00:05:05] have to wait and see if that works next
[00:05:07] on our list is Brazil it has also
[00:05:09] decided to keep all options open like
[00:05:12] Canada Brazil supplies steel and
[00:05:14] aluminium to the US these exports now
[00:05:16] face
[00:05:18] tariffs the government of Lula D Silva
[00:05:20] in Brazil has opened a dialogue with
[00:05:22] Washington they are working to secure a
[00:05:25] deal so we seeing a wide range of
[00:05:28] reactions with different countries
[00:05:30] trying different things to deal with the
[00:05:32] Tariff
[00:05:33] blows the question is how should India
[00:05:36] approach this because as things
[00:05:40] stand there may be no escaping the
[00:05:42] tariffs India is very much on Trump's
[00:05:44] radar after taking office he has
[00:05:46] repeatedly complained about India's
[00:05:48] tariffs even as New Delhi and Washington
[00:05:50] are negotiating a trade deal the White
[00:05:52] House has doubled down on its criticism
[00:05:55] of India you look at uh India 150%
[00:05:59] tariff on American American alcohol you
[00:06:00] think that's helping Kentucky bourbon be
[00:06:03] exported into India I don't think so
[00:06:05] 100% tariff on agricultural products
[00:06:07] from India look at Japan tariffing rice
[00:06:11] 700% president Trump believes in
[00:06:13] reciprocity and it is about dang time
[00:06:16] that we have a president who actually
[00:06:18] looks out for the interests of American
[00:06:20] businesses and
[00:06:22] workers so where does India stand like
[00:06:25] Mexico and Brazil India is taking a
[00:06:27] cautious approach it wants to see how
[00:06:29] the trading negotiations play out but
[00:06:31] time is running out president Trump has
[00:06:34] set a deadline for 2nd April just like
[00:06:38] India Vietnam and South Korea are also
[00:06:40] making contingency plans there's a fair
[00:06:43] bit of uncertainty Trump's actions often
[00:06:45] do not match his words but he is the
[00:06:49] president of the United States and it
[00:06:50] won't be wise to disregard his
[00:06:53] threats the world is on notice needless
[00:06:57] to say we'll be tracking this for you
[00:07:01] Hi how are you very well thank you thank
[00:07:03] you for being here Namaste Mr
[00:07:06] President Namaste how many people
[00:07:08] generally follow you in interviews
[00:07:10] typically in a month we have uh viewers
[00:07:14] uh up to 150 million that's more than
[00:07:16] twice the population of France and in
[00:07:18] the last two years we had three billion
[00:07:20] viewers so I say Lon this is your chance
[00:07:22] to be famous you're on first
[00:07:27] post one word to describe your equation
[00:07:30] with Prime Minister
[00:07:31] Modi as India and France work together
[00:07:34] are you creating a new era of
[00:07:36] non-alignment in the technology space
[00:07:39] India is a training superpower 1 million
[00:07:43] Engineers a year more than all of Europe
[00:07:46] and the US combined so we have that
[00:07:47] partnership we have a partnership on the
[00:07:50] environment and the economy we also have
[00:07:52] civilian nuclear programs and that is
[00:07:55] something we've developed far beyond the
[00:07:57] France India relationship so we want to
[00:08:00] work together on
[00:08:01] [Music]
[00:08:04] AI and then comes China with its deep
[00:08:06] sea creating models at a fraction of the
[00:08:09] cost did that Innovation take you by
[00:08:11] surprise did that breakthrough make you
[00:08:12] sit up and think what what did the
[00:08:14] Chinese do and how but what did deep
[00:08:16] seek do they took everything that was
[00:08:17] already available from the last AI model
[00:08:20] and then uh they recalibrated it so are
[00:08:23] you going to ban Chinese AI in France so
[00:08:25] we don't have this American approach of
[00:08:27] banning Tech because of where it comes
[00:08:30] from
[00:08:33] [Music]
