[00:00:00] quantum computers have the potential to
[00:00:02] be the most important the most dangerous
[00:00:05] and the most unpredictable invention of
[00:00:08] our lifetime they can even become all
[00:00:11] three of those things all at the same
[00:00:14] time we hear this term come up every now
[00:00:16] and again it sounds very futuristic and
[00:00:19] speculative but quantum computers are
[00:00:22] very real they exist right now and they
[00:00:25] are on the verge of becoming a big part
[00:00:28] of our daily lives
[00:00:30] you don't need to be a physicist to
[00:00:32] understand the role that these Quantum
[00:00:34] machines could play in changing the
[00:00:35] world as we know it and I'm here to
[00:00:38] guide you into the quantum realm let's
[00:00:46] go okay Marvel's Ant-Man has some
[00:00:48] questionable physics at best but one
[00:00:51] thing that Professor Pim does have right
[00:00:53] is that the smaller things get the
[00:00:55] stranger the laws of physics that govern
[00:00:57] them will become this is important to
[00:01:00] keep in mind as we go along you've
[00:01:02] probably seen a quantum computer before
[00:01:04] it looks pretty weird more like some
[00:01:07] kind of a cross between a golden
[00:01:09] Chandelier and a giant squid than
[00:01:11] anything we traditionally associate with
[00:01:13] a computer but that's largely because
[00:01:16] our current Viewpoint is a little too
[00:01:18] narrow this thing is also a computer the
[00:01:21] first computer actually as in the first
[00:01:24] ever it was found at the bottom of the
[00:01:26] Mediterranean Sea and dates back to
[00:01:29] ancient Greece it is known as the anti
[00:01:31] theera mechanism it was used to predict
[00:01:34] the movements of the Sun the Moon and
[00:01:36] the Earth it could have forecasted a
[00:01:38] solar eclipse decades in advance the
[00:01:40] same as we can today and this computer
[00:01:44] also looks pretty weird although these
[00:01:46] shiny golden mechanisms you're seeing
[00:01:48] are just artistic Recreations the real
[00:01:51] artifact is actually a bunch of
[00:01:53] fragments encrusted with thousands of
[00:01:55] years worth of ocean Gunk calculating
[00:01:57] machines have taken many forms over this
[00:01:59] centuries that they've been used by
[00:02:01] humankind so in many ways the quantum
[00:02:04] computer is just a next phase of
[00:02:06] evolution but in many other ways it's
[00:02:08] not that at all modern computers as we
[00:02:11] know them are defined by bits a bit is
[00:02:14] the smallest unit of data that a
[00:02:16] computer can process and store bits are
[00:02:19] the building blocks of every piece of
[00:02:21] digital information you have ever
[00:02:23] experienced a bit is always existing in
[00:02:26] one of two states kind of like a switch
[00:02:28] this is why we say that computer speak a
[00:02:30] binary language the state of each bit is
[00:02:33] typically represented by either a one or
[00:02:36] a zero but it can also be represented by
[00:02:39] on or off up or down left or right as
[00:02:42] long as each bit is holding one of two
[00:02:44] potential values this is binary
[00:02:47] Computing the physical manifestation of
[00:02:50] a bit is called a transistor this is
[00:02:52] like an electronic switch and again it
[00:02:55] can exist in one of two potential States
[00:02:57] on and off so the more physical
[00:03:00] transistors you have the more bits of
[00:03:02] information you can process at one time
[00:03:05] which is an oversimplification but it
[00:03:07] gets the point across so we've been
[00:03:10] constantly trying to make these
[00:03:11] transistors smaller and smaller over
[00:03:13] time so that we can fit more transistors
[00:03:15] into increasingly smaller devices this
[00:03:18] old desktop calculator from the 1960s
[00:03:21] used 250 transistors a current model
[00:03:25] iPhone has 19 billion transistors in its
[00:03:28] main processor chip of alone to
[00:03:30] accomplish this we have reduced the size
[00:03:33] of the transistor down to a width of
[00:03:35] just 3 nanom this is too small for the
[00:03:38] mind to truly comprehend it's only
[00:03:41] slightly wider than a strand of human
[00:03:44] DNA which is 2 and a half nanometers
[00:03:47] it's possible the transistors could be
[00:03:49] reduced to the size of 1 nanometer by
[00:03:52] the end of this decade there is a
[00:03:54] physical limitation on how small they
[00:03:56] can be but regardless of how small you
[00:03:58] make a transistor it is still limited by
[00:04:01] the binary nature of the bit it can only
[00:04:03] ever be in one of two states and this is
[00:04:07] where quantum computers come into play a
[00:04:09] quantum computer uses its own unit of
[00:04:12] data measurement which is the Cubit and
[00:04:15] these things can get pretty weird
[00:04:17] because cubits also represent ones and
[00:04:20] zeros just like traditional bits but
[00:04:22] cubits can also represent both one and
[00:04:25] zero at the same time they are nonbinary
[00:04:29] and this ENT potentially gives cubits
[00:04:30] the potential to hold vastly more
[00:04:33] information than traditional bits and
[00:04:36] the physical manifestation of a cubit is
[00:04:38] achieved by manipulating the spin state
[00:04:40] of subatomic particles either protons or
[00:04:43] electrons causing them to spin up and
[00:04:45] down or left and right creating two
[00:04:48] distinct States your one and zero except
[00:04:52] quantum mechanics allows these subatomic
[00:04:54] particles to exist in multiple States
[00:04:57] simultaneously so they can potentially
[00:04:59] be spit
[00:05:00] in all directions all at once remember
[00:05:03] the smaller things get the stranger the
[00:05:05] laws that govern them here's what that
[00:05:08] looks like if you put two bits together
[00:05:10] we know that each bit will represent
[00:05:12] either a one or a zero so regardless of
[00:05:15] the combination you have two bits of
[00:05:17] information but when you put two cubits
[00:05:19] together you end up with the equivalent
[00:05:21] of four bits of information this is
[00:05:24] because there are now four possible
[00:05:26] combinations of one and zero because
[00:05:28] each Cubit has the potential to be both
[00:05:31] values at the same time so instead of
[00:05:33] just being one and zero the pair could
[00:05:35] also be zero and one or one and one or
[00:05:38] zero and zero all at the same time if
[00:05:41] this is starting to sound familiar then
[00:05:43] that's probably because you're already a
[00:05:45] Quantum physicist or you've heard about
[00:05:47] a thought experiment called
[00:05:48] Schrodinger's Cat the basic explanation
[00:05:51] of Schrodinger's idea is that you could
[00:05:53] take a cat and put it in a box then put
[00:05:56] something else in the box that could
[00:05:57] potentially kill the cat like like a cup
[00:06:00] of poison then you seal the Box again
[00:06:03] thought experiment no one put a cat in a
[00:06:05] box with poison at least not that we
[00:06:07] know of now as long as there is no way
[00:06:09] for us on the outside to know what's
[00:06:11] happened inside the box then we have no
[00:06:14] evidence to suggest that the cat is dead
[00:06:16] or alive maybe it drank the poison maybe
[00:06:19] it didn't my cat eats plastic but
[00:06:22] refuses to eat chicken they're
[00:06:23] unpredictable creatures and as long as
[00:06:25] we have no observable method to predict
[00:06:28] the fate of the cat then it may be
[00:06:30] considered simultaneously to be both
[00:06:32] dead and alive at the same time this is
[00:06:35] referred to in quantum physics as a
[00:06:37] super position and it is a state in
[00:06:39] which our cubits are able to reside they
[00:06:42] are two potential outcomes occurring
[00:06:45] simultaneously now the trick here is
[00:06:47] that the moment you open the box and
[00:06:49] check on the well-being of the cat that
[00:06:51] superp position collapses back into a
[00:06:54] binary the cat will either be dead or
[00:06:57] alive and the same applies to cubits
[00:06:59] they eventually have to pick a side and
[00:07:01] resolve as either a one or a zero but
[00:07:04] that time spent in a super position
[00:07:07] allows the quantum computer to explore a
[00:07:09] vast network of potential combinations
[00:07:13] before arriving at a final answer this
[00:07:16] super position is where the quantum
[00:07:18] computer gets its power when you start
[00:07:21] adding up all of the potential values
[00:07:23] from the superp positions of multiple
[00:07:25] cubits working together then you start
[00:07:27] to get some pretty staggering numbers
[00:07:29] remember when we said that two cubits
[00:07:31] were able to store four possible values
[00:07:34] making them equivalent to four standard
[00:07:36] bits well combining just 20 cubits
[00:07:39] together will produce more than 1
[00:07:41] million potential values the largest
[00:07:44] quantum computer that exists today that
[00:07:46] we know of was built by IBM and has over
[00:07:49] 1,000 cubits of processing power in one
[00:07:53] decade from now IBM expects that will
[00:07:55] increase to 100,000 cubits now now what
[00:08:00] does that mean for you and me the first
[00:08:03] thing that we should establish is that
[00:08:05] quantum computers are not just a better
[00:08:07] version of our existing computers they
[00:08:09] are less of an evolution and more like
[00:08:12] an alternative mode of transportation
[00:08:14] quantum computers can take us to places
[00:08:16] that we have never been before in the
[00:08:19] same way that your boat can take you
[00:08:21] places that your car can't drive but a
[00:08:23] boat is not an improvement on a car or a
[00:08:26] substitute so Quantum Computing will not
[00:08:28] be replaced 99% of the jobs that are
[00:08:31] currently done by existing
[00:08:32] supercomputers and you definitely won't
[00:08:34] be adding one to your existing lineup of
[00:08:37] personal Tech the most simple reason for
[00:08:39] this is that in order for a Quantum chip
[00:08:42] full of cubits to actually function it
[00:08:44] needs to be held at a temperature as
[00:08:46] close to absolute zero as physically
[00:08:49] possible this is as cold as cold can be
[00:08:52] it's colder than the vacuum of space so
[00:08:55] in order to even operate a quantum
[00:08:58] computer you first need need to obtain
[00:09:00] the world's most powerful freezer oh and
[00:09:03] even with the necessary cooling system
[00:09:05] existing quantum computers can only
[00:09:07] operate for around 1 second at a time
[00:09:10] before the cubits lose their
[00:09:12] superposition State the second problem
[00:09:14] is a bit more difficult to wrap your
[00:09:16] head around but in simple terms quantum
[00:09:18] computers are actually able to make
[00:09:21] mistakes and they do it fairly often
[00:09:24] this is a bit of a weird one because
[00:09:26] most of us are not really familiar with
[00:09:27] computers that make mistakes imagine if
[00:09:30] your calculator just occasionally gave
[00:09:32] you the wrong answer and existing
[00:09:34] quantum computers tend to have error
[00:09:35] rates that sit between 1 and 100 at
[00:09:38] worst and one in 1,000 at best it's been
[00:09:41] speculated that in order for a quantum
[00:09:43] computer to be truly practical the error
[00:09:46] rate needs to be reduced to at least 1
[00:09:48] in 1 million this comes down to the
[00:09:51] nature of cubits and their
[00:09:52] superpositions each Cubit on its own is
[00:09:55] inherently unstable and when you begin
[00:09:58] combining multiple cubits together that
[00:10:00] instability will only multiply
[00:10:02] essentially meaning that the more
[00:10:04] capable your quantum computer is the
[00:10:06] more likely it will be to make an error
[00:10:09] with great power comes great instability
[00:10:12] but even with this factor of
[00:10:13] unpredictability taken into account it
[00:10:16] is still more than possible for existing
[00:10:18] quantum computers to solve math problems
[00:10:20] in a matter of seconds that would take a
[00:10:23] conventional computer thousands of years
[00:10:25] to complete this actually has the
[00:10:28] potential to become a really big problem
[00:10:31] but is it one that you should be worried
[00:10:33] about most iPhone users probably missed
[00:10:36] this announcement but in February 2024
[00:10:39] Apple revealed that iMessage had been
[00:10:41] cryptographically upgraded with
[00:10:43] postquantum security meaning that even a
[00:10:46] sophisticated quantum computer attack
[00:10:48] would not be able to Brute Force hack
[00:10:50] your iMessage account which is good news
[00:10:53] but it also demonstrates that Apple has
[00:10:55] enough concern about the potential
[00:10:57] Quantum of hacking to take it seriously
[00:11:00] and apple is one of the leaders in this
[00:11:02] current move towards Quantum safe
[00:11:04] encryption which means that there are
[00:11:06] still plenty of online services that you
[00:11:08] probably use that have not taken the
[00:11:11] same measure that includes emails bank
[00:11:13] accounts cloud storage even
[00:11:15] cryptocurrency wallets like Bitcoin that
[00:11:17] are literally built on cryptography it's
[00:11:20] in the name these private keys can be
[00:11:22] Brute Force hacked by quantum computers
[00:11:25] one of the biggest problems we have
[00:11:27] right now is that the arms race towards
[00:11:29] Quantum Supremacy is not being won by
[00:11:32] the United States this is an area where
[00:11:35] China has taken the early lead they have
[00:11:38] the largest quantity of powerful and
[00:11:40] stable quantum computers in 2020 then
[00:11:43] president Donald Trump announced that
[00:11:45] the US government would be spending $1
[00:11:47] billion per year on Quantum Computing in
[00:11:50] America by 2022 the Chinese Communist
[00:11:53] Party had committed $15 billion per year
[00:11:56] for their own Quantum development so
[00:11:59] that is a bit scary but is there
[00:12:02] anything that any of us normal people
[00:12:04] can really do about it well not really
[00:12:07] but it's maybe worth keeping an eye on
[00:12:09] which Services you use that are
[00:12:10] upgrading to postquantum encryption and
[00:12:13] if it's something that you're concerned
[00:12:14] about then maybe consider switching to
[00:12:16] services with higher levels of
[00:12:18] encryption it's not a fun thing to think
[00:12:20] about but this is the world we live in
[00:12:23] now I want to leave you with something
[00:12:25] fun to think about the potential
[00:12:27] importance of quantum computers for
[00:12:29] doing good things things so immeasurably
[00:12:32] good that they will change the course of
[00:12:35] human history towards the science
[00:12:37] fiction Star Trek utopian future that
[00:12:39] has so far only been dreamed about if
[00:12:42] there's one thing that our existing
[00:12:44] computer systems are really lacking it
[00:12:46] would be an ability to understand nature
[00:12:49] and the physical world traditionally
[00:12:51] computers have been pretty bad at
[00:12:53] grasping very important Concepts like
[00:12:56] biology and weather for example we can't
[00:12:58] cure cancer because we still do not
[00:13:01] understand cancer 20 years ago
[00:13:03] scientists were able to map the human
[00:13:05] genome with help from supercomputers of
[00:13:07] the time it was an amazing
[00:13:09] accomplishment but even with vastly more
[00:13:12] powerful machines available in the
[00:13:13] modern day we are failing to make
[00:13:15] meaningful breakthroughs in medical
[00:13:17] science one of the biggest problems here
[00:13:20] is that forces of nature like diseases
[00:13:22] and viruses also operate on the quantum
[00:13:26] level just like the cubits and that
[00:13:28] means that they have their own
[00:13:29] superpositions where subatomic particles
[00:13:32] within the virus are existing in
[00:13:34] multiple States simultaneously meaning
[00:13:37] that just like schroedinger's cat there
[00:13:39] is no right answer until we open the box
[00:13:43] and when it comes to opening the box on
[00:13:45] the nature of life the universe and
[00:13:47] everything we need to be able to meet
[00:13:50] nature on its own level which goes all
[00:13:53] the way down to the foundation of the
[00:13:55] atoms that make up the universe nature
[00:13:58] is operating at the quantum scale and
[00:14:01] that's where we need to go in order to
[00:14:04] finally understand it we're not there
[00:14:06] yet it might happen in my lifetime or
[00:14:09] yours it might not but for the first
[00:14:11] time in the three billion year history
[00:14:13] of life on Earth we are pretty close to
[00:14:16] figuring it all out and that in itself
[00:14:19] is a pretty amazing thing to be around
[00:14:21] for
