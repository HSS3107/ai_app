[00:00:29] >> Hello everybody.
[00:00:30] [ Applause ]
[00:00:35] >> My name is Mike Stern.
[00:00:36] I manage the Design Evangelism
[00:00:38] Team at Apple, and it is my
[00:00:39] honor to be with you today to
[00:00:41] talk about design.
[00:00:44] Now, at Apple, we often use the
[00:00:46] term human interface to describe
[00:00:48] what might otherwise be called
[00:00:50] user interface.
[00:00:52] Human interface is an uncommon,
[00:00:55] not widely used term, but it has
[00:00:58] a really long history at Apple.
[00:01:01] Our design documentation, this
[00:01:02] is the newly redesigned macOS
[00:01:05] HIG, it is called the Human
[00:01:07] Interface Guidelines.
[00:01:10] This document goes all the way
[00:01:12] back to 1978, a full 15 years
[00:01:17] before I was even born.
[00:01:19] I'm just kidding.
[00:01:20] I'm old [laughter].
[00:01:22] The word user can have a
[00:01:24] clinical or anonymizing effect.
[00:01:27] It narrowly defines people in
[00:01:29] relation to the interface.
[00:01:32] Human evokes a much more nuance
[00:01:34] picture of who it is that we are
[00:01:36] designing for.
[00:01:38] If I say I'm only human, it is
[00:01:40] to acknowledge that I have
[00:01:41] imperfections, and I have
[00:01:43] shortcomings.
[00:01:44] I might fall short of your
[00:01:45] expectations of me.
[00:01:47] Hopefully not right now.
[00:01:49] But the word human is also how
[00:01:51] we express our highest and most
[00:01:54] noble qualities.
[00:01:56] When you acknowledge someone's
[00:01:57] humanity, you're recognizing
[00:01:59] their kindness, their
[00:02:01] compassion, their generosity and
[00:02:06] goodness.
[00:02:06] Designing an interface is
[00:02:08] fundamentally about serving
[00:02:09] other human beings.
[00:02:11] The goal isn't to make a
[00:02:12] beautiful app, or a
[00:02:14] well-organized app, or a simple
[00:02:16] app or a focused app.
[00:02:18] Those things are all really
[00:02:19] important, but they're not the
[00:02:21] real goal.
[00:02:23] The real goal is about serving
[00:02:26] the human beings or positively
[00:02:28] affecting the lives of the
[00:02:29] people who use the apps that you
[00:02:31] make.
[00:02:33] The only thing that really
[00:02:35] matters is how well your app
[00:02:37] satisfies the emotional and
[00:02:39] practical needs of the people
[00:02:41] you are designing for.
[00:02:44] We have the need for safety and
[00:02:46] predictability.
[00:02:48] We have a need for knowledge,
[00:02:50] for meaning, and understanding.
[00:02:53] We have a need to accomplish
[00:02:55] tasks, to achieve our personal
[00:02:58] and professional goals.
[00:03:00] And we have the need to
[00:03:02] experience beauty and joy.
[00:03:06] Well-designed apps should
[00:03:08] provide these things.
[00:03:11] Well-designed apps make it easy
[00:03:13] for people to predict the
[00:03:15] consequences that their actions
[00:03:16] will have.
[00:03:18] They feel stable, solid,
[00:03:21] trustworthy.
[00:03:23] They help people to make
[00:03:24] informed choices by providing
[00:03:26] information that is clear and
[00:03:28] helpful.
[00:03:29] They have streamlined and
[00:03:31] simplified workflows, so that
[00:03:33] people can effectively and
[00:03:35] efficiently accomplish their
[00:03:37] tasks.
[00:03:38] And they should have an
[00:03:40] aesthetically pleasing,
[00:03:42] enjoyable, and even delightful
[00:03:45] experience.
[00:03:48] Using apps that provides these
[00:03:49] qualities is so gratifying, so
[00:03:52] satisfying, you can tell that
[00:03:53] the people who made the app
[00:03:55] fully considered your needs.
[00:03:59] You sense all the time and all
[00:04:01] the effort that went into
[00:04:02] figuring out how to help you get
[00:04:04] things done quickly and
[00:04:05] successfully.
[00:04:07] Everything is there for a
[00:04:08] purpose.
[00:04:09] Everything is understandable.
[00:04:12] It just feels so human.
[00:04:15] When an app makes us feel this
[00:04:18] way, we sense the humanity of
[00:04:21] the people who designed it.
[00:04:24] So how does the design of your
[00:04:26] app accomplish this?
[00:04:28] Now, when we talk about design,
[00:04:31] we often focus on technique and
[00:04:34] process.
[00:04:35] And while these are important
[00:04:36] considerations, they don't lead
[00:04:38] to great designs.
[00:04:40] At least not on their own.
[00:04:42] Great designs are guided by a
[00:04:44] deeper understanding about what
[00:04:47] design is, at a more
[00:04:49] fundamental, more human level.
[00:04:54] This is what design principles
[00:04:56] offer us.
[00:04:57] They express core truths about
[00:05:00] how we perceive the world around
[00:05:02] us.
[00:05:03] How we process information, how
[00:05:05] we make decisions, and how we
[00:05:07] communicate.
[00:05:09] These truths are universal and
[00:05:12] timeless.
[00:05:14] They apply to all kinds of
[00:05:16] graphic design.
[00:05:17] Graphic design architecture,
[00:05:19] interior design, retail design,
[00:05:21] landscape design, landscape
[00:05:22] design, automotive design, I
[00:05:24] think I said landscape twice,
[00:05:26] and every other type of design.
[00:05:29] Design principles don't tell us
[00:05:31] how to do specific things in our
[00:05:33] design, they tell us why we
[00:05:35] should do those things.
[00:05:38] They serve as the foundation
[00:05:40] upon which great designs are
[00:05:42] built.
[00:05:44] This session is about sharing
[00:05:46] those principles with you.
[00:05:49] Now, some of the things I'll
[00:05:52] share today might seem kind of
[00:05:54] basic or obvious.
[00:05:57] But the most profound things are
[00:05:59] often the simplest.
[00:06:01] I've been designing for over 20
[00:06:03] years.
[00:06:04] I've been fortunate enough to
[00:06:05] have worked with many brilliant
[00:06:06] designers, both at Apple and in
[00:06:08] the developer community.
[00:06:10] I've had in-depth discussions
[00:06:12] about a wide range of
[00:06:13] interaction design challenges
[00:06:15] across a full spectrum of apps
[00:06:17] and games with people from
[00:06:19] across the globe.
[00:06:21] And in all of those experiences,
[00:06:22] I'm constantly reminded, I
[00:06:24] constantly return to just how
[00:06:26] clarifying it is to evaluate a
[00:06:29] design against the core
[00:06:31] principles that we are about to
[00:06:33] explore.
[00:06:35] Okay. So, because design
[00:06:38] principles are universal, I
[00:06:41] thought it would be fun for us
[00:06:42] to explore how these design
[00:06:43] principles shape our experiences
[00:06:46] in the real world.
[00:06:49] Now, there really is no better
[00:06:50] way to explore the real world
[00:06:52] than to travel.
[00:06:53] So, with that in mind, I thought
[00:06:55] we would all go on a little trip
[00:06:57] together.
[00:06:58] Now, it took quite a bit of
[00:07:00] persuading, but we managed to
[00:07:02] allocate a portion of the
[00:07:04] evangelism team's travel budget
[00:07:06] to buy each one of you here
[00:07:08] today a ticket to Hawaii.
[00:07:12] What? Right?
[00:07:14] That's pretty awesome.
[00:07:16] Sandy beaches, rainforests,
[00:07:18] tropical drinks.
[00:07:20] Sounds pretty great, right?
[00:07:22] Okay who is down?
[00:07:23] Who wants to go on this trip?
[00:07:24] [Applause and cheering] Yeah?
[00:07:25] All right.
[00:07:28] Let's go. Now, our journey to
[00:07:30] lovely Hawaii is going to begin
[00:07:31] somewhere slightly less lovely,
[00:07:34] at the airport.
[00:07:36] As we approach the airport, we
[00:07:37] are going to see all sorts of
[00:07:39] signs.
[00:07:41] At first, we see signs about how
[00:07:42] to get to our terminal.
[00:07:44] Then we see signs that provide
[00:07:47] more specific information about
[00:07:48] what's at each terminal, and
[00:07:50] after we find our terminal and
[00:07:51] park, we head into the terminal,
[00:07:54] and then we get directions to
[00:07:55] our gate.
[00:07:57] And once we get to our gate, we
[00:07:58] are going to know we're in the
[00:07:59] right place, because there is a
[00:08:00] big old sign telling us so.
[00:08:03] And if we are in the wrong
[00:08:04] place, or if our flight was
[00:08:05] moved, we get directions to
[00:08:08] nearby gates.
[00:08:10] And in case there is an
[00:08:11] emergency or we just want to
[00:08:14] leave, nearby exits are clearly
[00:08:16] marked.
[00:08:18] The system of signs that we
[00:08:19] followed is what is called a
[00:08:21] wayfinding system.
[00:08:23] Wayfinding systems help people
[00:08:25] to navigate complex environments
[00:08:28] quickly and successfully.
[00:08:30] They are critical for helping
[00:08:31] people feel oriented and safe.
[00:08:34] People at airports are tired,
[00:08:36] they're jet-lagged, they're in a
[00:08:38] rush, they're stressed out.
[00:08:41] So airports need to think really
[00:08:42] deeply about wayfinding.
[00:08:44] Good wayfinding systems offer a
[00:08:48] comprehensive and understandable
[00:08:50] list of general locations that
[00:08:53] people can visit.
[00:08:55] They provide needed detail about
[00:08:57] what's in those locations.
[00:08:59] They are highly contextual.
[00:09:01] They become increasingly
[00:09:02] specific as we navigate deeper
[00:09:04] and deeper into the system.
[00:09:07] They help people to orient
[00:09:08] themselves by clearly
[00:09:09] highlighting their current
[00:09:10] location relative to other
[00:09:12] locations.
[00:09:14] And they provide a clear exit
[00:09:16] path.
[00:09:17] It's so comforting to know that
[00:09:20] you can return to a place that
[00:09:21] is more familiar and start over.
[00:09:25] Wayfinding helps us to feel safe
[00:09:28] by answering really basic
[00:09:30] questions like: where am I?
[00:09:34] Where can I go?
[00:09:36] What will I find when I get
[00:09:37] there?
[00:09:38] What's nearby?
[00:09:40] And how do I get out?
[00:09:43] Without answers to questions
[00:09:44] like these, we'd be lost.
[00:09:47] Now, your app's interface is
[00:09:49] really just one big old
[00:09:51] wayfinding system.
[00:09:52] The navigation bar, the content
[00:09:54] area, the tab bar, they're all
[00:09:55] just tools for providing
[00:09:56] wayfinding in your app.
[00:09:58] The navigation bar title and
[00:10:00] selected tab bar item lets
[00:10:02] people know where they are.
[00:10:04] Tab bar in content areas lets
[00:10:06] people know where they can go
[00:10:07] and what's nearby.
[00:10:09] Simply rendered and recognizable
[00:10:11] tab bar glyphs and
[00:10:12] understandable labels suggest to
[00:10:14] people what they will find when
[00:10:16] they get there.
[00:10:18] And back buttons offer an exit
[00:10:20] route, and can help people to
[00:10:21] identify what area of the app
[00:10:23] that they're in.
[00:10:25] Now every screen in your app
[00:10:28] should answer all of these
[00:10:29] questions, or else people will
[00:10:31] feel lost.
[00:10:32] So go through your app.
[00:10:35] Go one screen at a time, and ask
[00:10:37] yourself, how well is each
[00:10:39] screen answering these
[00:10:40] questions?
[00:10:42] Does every screen help people to
[00:10:43] know where they are?
[00:10:45] Does every screen help provide
[00:10:46] options to people to tell them
[00:10:48] where else they can go?
[00:10:50] If some screens aren't answering
[00:10:52] those questions clearly, then
[00:10:54] there is some work to be done.
[00:10:55] All right.
[00:10:58] So we have a flight to catch.
[00:11:00] Paradise awaits.
[00:11:03] Wow. That was a quick flight.
[00:11:04] If only they were all so quick.
[00:11:08] So we have arrived in paradise,
[00:11:10] and it's time to pick up our car
[00:11:12] and head to the hotel.
[00:11:14] What a sweet car it is.
[00:11:16] It has got a sweet candy red
[00:11:18] paint job.
[00:11:19] Check out those rims.
[00:11:20] Looks like it will do zero to 60
[00:11:22] in like 10 or maybe 11 seconds.
[00:11:26] It is a pretty small car.
[00:11:27] If I were you, I would yell out
[00:11:29] shotgun right now.
[00:11:31] >> Shotgun!
[00:11:32] >> [Laughs] All right, all
[00:11:33] joking aside, cars are actually
[00:11:36] quite dangerous.
[00:11:37] The fact that we let people
[00:11:38] drive around two-ton metal
[00:11:40] objects at high velocities is
[00:11:41] kind of ludicrous.
[00:11:43] Especially when those people
[00:11:44] could be tired and navigating
[00:11:46] unfamiliar roads.
[00:11:48] Now, because of the inherent
[00:11:50] danger of driving a vehicle, car
[00:11:52] manufacturers have to think
[00:11:54] carefully about the design of
[00:11:56] interiors.
[00:11:57] Safety is a primary
[00:11:58] consideration.
[00:12:00] And so they're a great way for
[00:12:01] us to learn about the design
[00:12:03] principle of feedback.
[00:12:06] Feedback helps us to operate
[00:12:08] cars confidently and safely.
[00:12:10] Feedback helps us to anticipate
[00:12:12] problems that might cause the
[00:12:14] car to stop functioning properly
[00:12:16] or to stop moving all together.
[00:12:19] Our vacation definitely won't be
[00:12:21] very fun if that happens.
[00:12:24] Now, cars provide various forms
[00:12:25] of feedback.
[00:12:26] There is status feedback to let
[00:12:28] us know how the car is doing.
[00:12:29] There is completion feedback to
[00:12:31] let us know whether actions
[00:12:33] we've performed are completed
[00:12:35] successfully or failed.
[00:12:37] Warning feedback, to tell us
[00:12:38] about potential problems.
[00:12:40] And there is feedback to let us
[00:12:41] know when something we've tried
[00:12:43] to do has caused an error.
[00:12:45] Now, for our safety, for the
[00:12:48] safety of other drivers and
[00:12:49] pedestrians, the feedback that
[00:12:51] cars provide must be clear,
[00:12:53] immediate, and understandable.
[00:12:56] So let's check out how cars
[00:12:58] communicate with us, starting
[00:13:01] with how they tell us about
[00:13:02] their status.
[00:13:03] Now, we have all loaded into the
[00:13:05] car, and we are ready to go.
[00:13:07] So looking at the gear shifter,
[00:13:10] I can see that the car is in
[00:13:11] park.
[00:13:12] Knowing what gear the car is in
[00:13:14] is super important information.
[00:13:17] It is so important that it's
[00:13:18] displayed twice, on the
[00:13:20] gearshift, and in the instrument
[00:13:22] cluster.
[00:13:23] It would be really bad if I
[00:13:25] thought the car was in park when
[00:13:27] it was actually in drive, or if
[00:13:29] I thought the car was in drive,
[00:13:30] when it was actually in reverse.
[00:13:33] Other status feedback lets me
[00:13:35] see the fuel level, so I can
[00:13:36] anticipate and predict how far
[00:13:38] we can go before we need to
[00:13:40] refuel.
[00:13:42] And seeing our current speed
[00:13:43] helps me to avoid getting costly
[00:13:45] speeding tickets.
[00:13:47] These are two really critical
[00:13:49] pieces of information.
[00:13:50] I don't want to run out of gas
[00:13:51] before we get to the hotel, and
[00:13:53] the lovely folks in finance have
[00:13:54] told me repeatedly that I cannot
[00:13:56] expend speeding tickets.
[00:13:59] Now, status information in apps
[00:14:00] should be just as clear.
[00:14:02] So, for example, in the mail
[00:14:04] app, unread status indicators
[00:14:06] help people to prioritize which
[00:14:09] emails to read first.
[00:14:11] In Calendar, status indicators
[00:14:13] help people to see when someone
[00:14:15] can't make a meeting and it
[00:14:16] helps them determine if they
[00:14:17] need to reschedule.
[00:14:19] In the Camera app, there are
[00:14:20] three elements to let people
[00:14:22] know that a video is being
[00:14:23] recorded.
[00:14:24] The red dot, the incrementing
[00:14:26] time code, the state of the
[00:14:27] record button.
[00:14:28] They all let people know that a
[00:14:30] precious but fleeing moment is
[00:14:33] being recorded.
[00:14:35] Showing status clearly and
[00:14:37] directly is crucial for saving
[00:14:40] people time and helping them to
[00:14:42] avoid making mistakes.
[00:14:44] Next up is completion feedback.
[00:14:46] We are ready to go, so I start
[00:14:49] the car [engine starts].
[00:14:50] We can hear the engine turn
[00:14:53] over.
[00:14:54] We can feel the vibration of the
[00:14:56] motor running.
[00:14:57] We see that instrument cluster
[00:15:00] come to life.
[00:15:01] There is no doubt that we are
[00:15:03] ready to go.
[00:15:04] And as I shift, from Park into
[00:15:07] Drive, I get tactile feedback to
[00:15:11] let me know that I'm moving
[00:15:12] through those gears.
[00:15:14] And as we pull out of the
[00:15:15] parking spot, we hear [clicking]
[00:15:18] the doors lock.
[00:15:20] This happens automatically, so
[00:15:21] it is even more important that
[00:15:23] we get this feedback.
[00:15:25] All of this feedback is
[00:15:26] reassuring.
[00:15:28] It's our car's way of saying it
[00:15:30] is all good, I'm doing exactly
[00:15:32] what it is that you wanted me to
[00:15:33] do, and this frees me up to
[00:15:35] focus on other cognitive tasks,
[00:15:37] like making sure it's safe to
[00:15:39] pull out of the parking spot.
[00:15:42] Completion feedback in apps
[00:15:44] serves the very same purpose.
[00:15:46] The sound of a locked iPhone
[00:15:48] [clicking].
[00:15:48] The animation of an email being
[00:15:51] marked as unread, or the
[00:15:54] animation of an email being
[00:15:56] deleted.
[00:15:57] These cues are discreet, and
[00:15:59] they're non-invasive, but
[00:16:00] they're hard to ignore, and they
[00:16:02] provide that necessary
[00:16:03] reassurance that our devices are
[00:16:05] performing as expected.
[00:16:07] Of course, confirmation feedback
[00:16:09] can be even more obvious.
[00:16:11] The animation and sound of a
[00:16:13] successful Apple Pay transaction
[00:16:14] [tone sounds].
[00:16:15] It's very hard to miss.
[00:16:18] Every action taken in your app
[00:16:21] should provide some form of
[00:16:22] confirmation feedback, because
[00:16:24] it is absolutely necessary for
[00:16:25] letting people know that actions
[00:16:27] they've performed were
[00:16:28] successful.
[00:16:30] Warnings help people to
[00:16:32] understand in advance about
[00:16:33] potential errors.
[00:16:35] Low fuel level.
[00:16:36] Low break pads.
[00:16:38] Low oil level.
[00:16:40] Warnings can be communicated
[00:16:41] using status indicators,
[00:16:43] messages, and the instrument
[00:16:44] cluster, built-in display,
[00:16:46] sounds, or all of the above.
[00:16:49] These warnings are important.
[00:16:51] They keep us safe, and they
[00:16:53] protect our car from damage.
[00:16:56] And lastly, error feedback in
[00:16:58] cars, as with apps, is crucial.
[00:17:01] If you try to start a car
[00:17:03] without gas, you will get an
[00:17:05] error message about that.
[00:17:07] Now errors are always
[00:17:09] disappointing and frustrating.
[00:17:11] It's best to help people avoid
[00:17:12] making errors in the first
[00:17:14] place.
[00:17:15] Warnings and confirmation
[00:17:17] feedback can help.
[00:17:18] For instance, in-line form
[00:17:20] validation is a fantastic
[00:17:21] technique for letting people
[00:17:23] know what values will be
[00:17:24] accepted, and what values will
[00:17:27] not.
[00:17:28] Getting this feedback in real
[00:17:29] time helps people to course
[00:17:31] correct so that they don't run
[00:17:32] into errors later.
[00:17:34] You can also try to infer what a
[00:17:37] person was wishing to do, or
[00:17:38] what they intended to do when
[00:17:40] they made a mistake, and then do
[00:17:42] something reasonable.
[00:17:44] So, for example, in the new
[00:17:47] version of Things 3, if you type
[00:17:49] in the date June 31st, which by
[00:17:52] the way is a date that does not
[00:17:53] exist, but it's a common mistake
[00:17:55] for people to make, the app
[00:17:57] doesn't throw up an error or
[00:17:59] show a warning.
[00:18:01] No. Instead, it automatically
[00:18:03] corrects the date to July 1st.
[00:18:06] It's such a subtle thing.
[00:18:08] It's kind of brilliant, and it's
[00:18:10] a very human thing to do.
[00:18:13] Now, as you can see, clear,
[00:18:15] timely, and understandable and
[00:18:17] informative feedback is
[00:18:18] essential.
[00:18:19] Feedback answers super important
[00:18:21] questions.
[00:18:22] What can I do?
[00:18:25] What just happened?
[00:18:27] What is currently happening?
[00:18:29] And what will happen in the
[00:18:31] future?
[00:18:32] Many apps do not do a very good
[00:18:35] job of providing feedback.
[00:18:38] The reason for this, I think, is
[00:18:40] that when you're designing, it
[00:18:41] is so easy to start to think
[00:18:42] about static screens, and you
[00:18:44] can lose sight of the fact that
[00:18:46] interactive experiences happen
[00:18:47] over time, with lots of back and
[00:18:50] forth.
[00:18:52] Good feedback is like having a
[00:18:53] conversation with the person who
[00:18:55] designed it.
[00:18:56] As a designer, feedback is your
[00:18:58] way of letting -- answering
[00:19:01] people's unspoken questions.
[00:19:03] It is your way of letting people
[00:19:05] know how they're doing, and
[00:19:06] providing helpful guidance to
[00:19:07] them.
[00:19:08] So when designing your app,
[00:19:11] imagine that you're having a
[00:19:12] conversation with the person who
[00:19:14] is using it.
[00:19:16] What would you say if you were
[00:19:17] in the room with them?
[00:19:20] How would you say it?
[00:19:22] I have a very simple, but highly
[00:19:23] effective technique to share
[00:19:25] with you.
[00:19:25] Ask someone who has never used
[00:19:27] your app before to use it.
[00:19:28] Have them tell you what they are
[00:19:30] thinking, what they think is
[00:19:31] unclear, what they find to be
[00:19:33] confusing.
[00:19:35] Then simply explain to them how
[00:19:37] your app actually works.
[00:19:40] Guide them along, explain to
[00:19:41] them what's happening, and what
[00:19:43] they should be paying attention
[00:19:44] to.
[00:19:46] Then step back.
[00:19:48] Consider how what you've said
[00:19:50] might differ from what the app
[00:19:51] is communicating.
[00:19:53] In my experience, when someone
[00:19:54] needs to explain their design to
[00:19:56] me, it is usually so much more
[00:19:58] clear than the design itself.
[00:20:03] What people tell me fills in the
[00:20:04] gaps that are left by their
[00:20:06] design.
[00:20:07] We tend to be much better
[00:20:09] communicators when we're sitting
[00:20:10] with someone in person to try to
[00:20:12] capture that experience.
[00:20:15] Okay, so that is feedback.
[00:20:17] Now, the next design principle
[00:20:18] is closely related to feedback,
[00:20:21] and that is the principle of
[00:20:22] visibility.
[00:20:24] Good feedback does not matter
[00:20:26] very much if people can't see
[00:20:27] it.
[00:20:28] Visibility captures something
[00:20:30] very obvious.
[00:20:32] The usability of a design is
[00:20:34] greatly improved when controls
[00:20:36] and information are clearly
[00:20:38] visible.
[00:20:39] See? It's kind of obvious.
[00:20:42] Consider how important
[00:20:43] visibility is in your car.
[00:20:46] The instrument cluster presents
[00:20:48] status information and warning
[00:20:49] indicators directly in front of
[00:20:51] you.
[00:20:52] Instrument clusters are visually
[00:20:53] cluttered.
[00:20:54] There's all sorts of text, and
[00:20:55] numbers and moving gauges and
[00:20:56] blinking lights and status
[00:20:57] indicators.
[00:20:59] They're not called clusters
[00:21:01] without reason.
[00:21:02] But all of this is necessary for
[00:21:05] operating a vehicle, and needs
[00:21:07] to be plainly visible, without
[00:21:10] you having to move your head or
[00:21:11] your body.
[00:21:13] Hiding some of this information
[00:21:15] or putting it elsewhere in the
[00:21:17] car would hurt usability.
[00:21:19] Critical feedback would just get
[00:21:21] ignored, and the same is true
[00:21:23] for apps.
[00:21:25] In the Mail app, badges provide
[00:21:27] helpful status information about
[00:21:29] email messages.
[00:21:31] Removing that information might
[00:21:33] reduce clutter.
[00:21:34] It could look a little bit
[00:21:34] cleaner, but it would greatly
[00:21:37] reduce usability.
[00:21:38] People would have to navigate
[00:21:40] into each email message to get
[00:21:42] that information.
[00:21:44] It would be very inefficient,
[00:21:45] and it would be very tedious.
[00:21:47] So it is important to surface
[00:21:49] key status information at higher
[00:21:51] levels whenever possible.
[00:21:54] Or, consider the navigation in
[00:21:56] the Clock app.
[00:21:57] What if that was hidden into a
[00:21:59] hamburger menu.
[00:22:01] People would have a much harder
[00:22:02] time seeing what other functions
[00:22:05] the Clock app offers to them
[00:22:07] beyond what is currently
[00:22:08] visible.
[00:22:10] Obviously there is a tradeoff
[00:22:11] here.
[00:22:12] Densely packed interfaces can be
[00:22:14] overwhelming and they can slow
[00:22:15] decision-making, especially for
[00:22:18] people who are new to your app.
[00:22:20] So visibility has to be weighed
[00:22:22] against other considerations.
[00:22:25] Now, with so many of us in the
[00:22:27] car, I'm starting to feel a
[00:22:28] little bit cramped, and I cannot
[00:22:31] wait to get to the hotel, but
[00:22:32] there is one more insanely
[00:22:34] important design principle to
[00:22:36] point out while we're here, and
[00:22:38] that is about consistency.
[00:22:41] The principle of consistency is
[00:22:43] about representing similar
[00:22:45] design features in similar ways.
[00:22:49] If you've driven a car before,
[00:22:51] there are symbols and terms that
[00:22:53] you are no doubt familiar with.
[00:22:55] You will recognize the symbols
[00:22:56] for door lock, for window, for
[00:22:58] gas, headlights, battery, oil,
[00:23:01] and so forth.
[00:23:03] You will be familiar with the
[00:23:04] definitions of words like Park,
[00:23:06] Drive, and Reverse, as they
[00:23:08] apply to the operation of a
[00:23:10] vehicle.
[00:23:12] Consistency also applies to the
[00:23:13] location and the configuration
[00:23:15] of controls.
[00:23:17] We all expect the brake to be on
[00:23:19] the left, and the accelerator to
[00:23:21] be on the right.
[00:23:23] Consistency greatly improves the
[00:23:25] usability of a vehicle, or maybe
[00:23:27] it is more clear to just flip
[00:23:29] this around and say that
[00:23:30] inconsistency undermines
[00:23:33] usability.
[00:23:34] Whoops. All cars share a common
[00:23:38] design vocabulary for these
[00:23:40] symbols and terms.
[00:23:42] All cars position controls in a
[00:23:44] relatively consistent way, and
[00:23:45] because of this consistency, we
[00:23:47] don't have to re-learn how to
[00:23:48] drive a car every time we get
[00:23:50] behind the wheel of a new one.
[00:23:52] Now, maybe this is obvious, but
[00:23:54] consistency is actually hard to
[00:23:57] achieve.
[00:23:58] You have to make a conscious
[00:23:59] effort to be consistent, and you
[00:24:02] have to be consistent with the
[00:24:04] right things.
[00:24:05] You have to fully consider what
[00:24:08] expectations people have when
[00:24:09] they come to your app.
[00:24:11] Those expectations are mostly
[00:24:13] informed by their experiences
[00:24:15] with the other apps that they
[00:24:16] use.
[00:24:17] The other apps that they use,
[00:24:19] how do you figure that out?
[00:24:20] Of course, it is impossible for
[00:24:22] you to know.
[00:24:23] But you can make some informed
[00:24:25] guesses.
[00:24:26] Perhaps they've used other apps
[00:24:28] that are similar to the things
[00:24:29] that your app does.
[00:24:31] Maybe not.
[00:24:32] But it's very likely that they
[00:24:34] have used other apps on the
[00:24:36] platform.
[00:24:37] So you should pay attention to
[00:24:38] platform conventions.
[00:24:40] Things like iconography and
[00:24:43] terminology, navigation schemes,
[00:24:45] and even common work flows for
[00:24:47] typical tasks.
[00:24:49] Now, let me give you just one
[00:24:51] example to make this, I think, a
[00:24:53] lot more concrete.
[00:24:55] On iOS, the glyph that we use to
[00:24:57] represent the concept of an
[00:24:59] action is an arrow that points
[00:25:01] up and away from a box.
[00:25:04] Because the most common action
[00:25:05] associated with this glyph is
[00:25:08] share, we affectionately call
[00:25:10] this a "sharrow."
[00:25:11] I love that name.
[00:25:14] Now, some apps use a different
[00:25:16] icon to represent a similar
[00:25:18] concept.
[00:25:19] This icon is commonplace.
[00:25:21] It is used on websites and other
[00:25:23] platforms.
[00:25:24] Now, this is a great glyph.
[00:25:26] Do not get me wrong.
[00:25:28] There is nothing wrong with this
[00:25:29] glyph at all.
[00:25:30] But it's not the symbol that iOS
[00:25:32] users are most familiar with.
[00:25:35] This glyph shows up in iOS apps
[00:25:37] because of the desire to be
[00:25:39] consistent, to consistently
[00:25:41] represent this concept in a
[00:25:43] consistent way across platforms
[00:25:46] or with your website.
[00:25:48] This is a perfectly rational and
[00:25:51] reasonable thing to do, but it
[00:25:53] is not the right call.
[00:25:55] From the perspective of the
[00:25:56] person who you are designing
[00:25:57] for, it is best to be consistent
[00:26:00] with the symbol that they are
[00:26:01] most familiar with.
[00:26:03] Being consistent will go a long
[00:26:05] way towards making your app more
[00:26:07] approachable and usable.
[00:26:09] Now, look, there is always the
[00:26:13] impulse to, you know, do things
[00:26:15] a little bit different.
[00:26:17] And to be clear, this is a
[00:26:19] really good thing.
[00:26:20] You should absolutely be trying
[00:26:24] out new ideas.
[00:26:25] That's how innovation happens.
[00:26:28] But inconsistencies about simple
[00:26:30] things, like icons and labels,
[00:26:32] can really trip people up.
[00:26:34] So it's always best to be
[00:26:36] consistent unless you have a
[00:26:37] very strong justification to do
[00:26:40] otherwise.
[00:26:41] Now, I'm sure you're all
[00:26:43] consistently ready to get out of
[00:26:44] this car and get to the hotel,
[00:26:45] but there is one last point
[00:26:46] about consistency that I'd like
[00:26:48] to make, and it is about
[00:26:49] internal consistency.
[00:26:51] Internal consistency is about
[00:26:53] designing controls to share a
[00:26:55] similar look and feel, that
[00:26:57] match each other.
[00:26:58] Your app's glyphs should have a
[00:27:00] consistent visual style.
[00:27:03] Text in your app should have a
[00:27:04] limited number of font faces and
[00:27:06] sizes and colors and so forth.
[00:27:10] Internal consistency helps to
[00:27:12] make an app feel cohesive or
[00:27:15] whole.
[00:27:16] When everything matches, when
[00:27:18] everything fits, people are
[00:27:20] given a deeper sense of a
[00:27:21] product's integrity.
[00:27:23] We intuitively believe that
[00:27:25] design choices were deliberate
[00:27:28] and thoroughly considered.
[00:27:31] And with very good reason.
[00:27:32] Being consistent takes
[00:27:34] self-control and restraint.
[00:27:37] All right, now because our car
[00:27:39] was so darn consistent, we
[00:27:40] finally managed to arrive safely
[00:27:42] at the hotel.
[00:27:44] That car ride was really stuffy.
[00:27:46] So you decide to head up to your
[00:27:47] room and freshen up a little
[00:27:49] bit.
[00:27:50] Perhaps you go throw on that
[00:27:51] fresh new Aloha shirt you picked
[00:27:53] up at the airport.
[00:27:55] So, when you get to your room,
[00:27:56] you head to the bathroom, and
[00:27:58] you turn the handles on the
[00:28:00] faucet and let the water run a
[00:28:02] little bit.
[00:28:03] And after a couple of seconds
[00:28:05] you put your finger under the
[00:28:06] water to check the temperature.
[00:28:08] It's still a little bit cool, so
[00:28:10] you increase the hot water a
[00:28:11] little bit.
[00:28:12] You wait another couple of
[00:28:13] seconds, and the water warms up,
[00:28:15] and you commence face washing.
[00:28:18] You feel refreshed and
[00:28:20] reinvigorated.
[00:28:23] Compared to driving a car, a
[00:28:25] faucet is really basic.
[00:28:27] But at some point, you had to
[00:28:29] learn how to use a faucet.
[00:28:31] You learned by adjusting the
[00:28:32] controls of various faucets and
[00:28:34] observing the results.
[00:28:36] For example, how do you know
[00:28:38] which handle controlled the hot
[00:28:39] water?
[00:28:40] You knew because for the most
[00:28:42] part hot water is controlled by
[00:28:44] the handle on the left.
[00:28:47] And why would you keep testing
[00:28:48] water temperature for a few
[00:28:49] seconds?
[00:28:50] You did this, because you expect
[00:28:52] there to be a delay between when
[00:28:53] you adjust the temperature and
[00:28:54] when the water actually gets
[00:28:56] warmer.
[00:28:56] Looking at the water, it is
[00:28:59] really hard to tell if the water
[00:29:01] is cold or hot, and we have all
[00:29:03] experienced burning our hand
[00:29:05] under a faucet.
[00:29:06] Now, you don't think about these
[00:29:08] things every time you use a
[00:29:10] faucet.
[00:29:10] You just intuitively expect
[00:29:12] them.
[00:29:14] Within each of your brains,
[00:29:16] there is this tiny, little
[00:29:18] adorable model of a faucet, and
[00:29:22] that model represents the faucet
[00:29:24] as a system of parts and
[00:29:27] functions and behaviors.
[00:29:30] There is a spout for producing
[00:29:32] water, there's handles for
[00:29:34] controlling temperature and
[00:29:35] flow.
[00:29:36] Those parts are arranged in
[00:29:37] specific configuration, and your
[00:29:41] model has certain behaviors,
[00:29:43] like the latency between when
[00:29:44] you adjust the hot water, and
[00:29:46] when the temperature of the
[00:29:47] water actually increases.
[00:29:49] This model is referred to as
[00:29:52] your mental model.
[00:29:54] You have a mental model of every
[00:29:56] system that you've ever
[00:29:57] interacted with.
[00:29:59] Those mental models are
[00:30:00] over-simplifications.
[00:30:02] They don't fully capture the
[00:30:03] inner workings of these systems.
[00:30:05] Though, the more experience you
[00:30:07] have with a system, the more
[00:30:08] sophisticated your model
[00:30:12] becomes.
[00:30:13] Mental models are developed
[00:30:13] through personal experience, and
[00:30:15] they're based on an incomplete
[00:30:16] set of facts, so everyone's
[00:30:18] mental model is unique.
[00:30:21] Now, real quick, there is
[00:30:22] actually two parts of a mental
[00:30:24] model that are worth
[00:30:25] understanding separately.
[00:30:27] A system model is the model
[00:30:29] about how a system works.
[00:30:32] Our system model might involve
[00:30:33] thinking about two independent
[00:30:35] sources of water, one hot, and
[00:30:37] one cold.
[00:30:38] And the system allows those
[00:30:40] inputs to be mixed, to create a
[00:30:42] range of temperatures.
[00:30:43] The system is not immediately
[00:30:45] responsive.
[00:30:46] Changes to temperature could
[00:30:47] take a little bit of time,
[00:30:49] especially when we first turn on
[00:30:50] the faucet, right?
[00:30:51] Our system model includes this
[00:30:53] understanding of variable
[00:30:55] latency and temperature.
[00:30:57] Okay. The other term is
[00:31:00] interaction model.
[00:31:01] Now, does anyone care to guess
[00:31:03] what that model is?
[00:31:05] Just go ahead and shout it out.
[00:31:07] No, I'm just kidding.
[00:31:08] Okay, you guys didn't fall for
[00:31:10] that.
[00:31:10] You're a smart crowd.
[00:31:11] If you guessed that it's a model
[00:31:13] about how we interact with the
[00:31:15] system, then you are correct.
[00:31:18] Our interaction model is that we
[00:31:20] adjust the temperature and water
[00:31:21] flow with the handles that are
[00:31:23] provided.
[00:31:25] Okay, so now that we know a
[00:31:26] couple of fancy terms, you might
[00:31:28] be wondering how all of this is
[00:31:30] relevant to you?
[00:31:31] Well, when a system such as a
[00:31:34] faucet matches our mental model,
[00:31:36] then our expectations of that
[00:31:38] system are met.
[00:31:39] When this happens, and we're not
[00:31:40] really conscious of our own
[00:31:42] expectations, we perceive the
[00:31:44] system to be intuitive.
[00:31:47] Conversely, when a system
[00:31:49] doesn't match our mental model,
[00:31:51] it breaks our expectations, and
[00:31:53] we perceive it to be
[00:31:54] unintuitive.
[00:31:57] Now, let's just sit with this
[00:31:58] concept for a second.
[00:32:00] Because it's a really, really
[00:32:01] important one in design.
[00:32:03] And to do that, I would like to
[00:32:06] share with you a little story
[00:32:08] about a faucet designer named
[00:32:11] Mortimer.
[00:32:13] Now, like all of you, Mortimer
[00:32:15] has a mental model of faucets.
[00:32:18] Though obviously Morty's mental
[00:32:20] model is way more sophisticated,
[00:32:22] and way more bad ass than yours.
[00:32:25] I'm just being real with you, he
[00:32:26] is a faucet designer for a
[00:32:27] living.
[00:32:29] Now, consider that job that he
[00:32:30] has.
[00:32:32] His job is all about making
[00:32:33] amazing, best in class,
[00:32:36] delightful faucet experiences.
[00:32:39] And one day, like a bolt of
[00:32:41] lightning, he's struck with this
[00:32:44] amazing idea.
[00:32:45] We have been doing this faucet
[00:32:47] thing all wrong.
[00:32:49] He has a new concept about how
[00:32:51] to make things better.
[00:32:53] Instead of using one handle for
[00:32:55] hot water flow, and another
[00:32:57] handle for cold water flow, we
[00:32:59] should just have one lever to
[00:33:01] control temperature, and the
[00:33:02] other should control flow.
[00:33:05] This way people won't
[00:33:06] accidentally increase or
[00:33:07] decrease temperature when they
[00:33:08] are adjusting flow and vice
[00:33:09] versa.
[00:33:11] It is brilliant.
[00:33:14] This is why they pay Mortimer
[00:33:16] the big bucks.
[00:33:17] Now, at this point, Morty has
[00:33:19] this new and super awesome
[00:33:21] mental model about faucets in
[00:33:23] his mind.
[00:33:24] Unfortunately, there is just one
[00:33:26] tiny little problem.
[00:33:30] Morty's mental model doesn't
[00:33:31] match the mental model that
[00:33:33] people have about faucets.
[00:33:35] When people use the Morty
[00:33:37] faucet, it doesn't match their
[00:33:38] expectations at all and they say
[00:33:41] it is unintuitive.
[00:33:43] What is worse, the Morty faucet
[00:33:45] looks nearly identical to a
[00:33:47] regular faucet, but it behaved
[00:33:49] totally different.
[00:33:51] When people turned on the hot
[00:33:52] water, no water came out.
[00:33:56] This mismatch between expected
[00:33:57] behavior and experienced reality
[00:34:00] created a major usability
[00:34:02] problem.
[00:34:03] Perhaps alterations to the
[00:34:05] faucet's form could suggest that
[00:34:06] it had a different interaction
[00:34:07] model.
[00:34:09] Maybe adding labels would help,
[00:34:10] but these are just remedies to a
[00:34:13] deeper issue.
[00:34:15] Labels and subtle variations of
[00:34:16] form are design cues that can
[00:34:18] easily be overlooked, especially
[00:34:20] when people have deeply
[00:34:21] ingrained notions about how a
[00:34:23] system works, and how they
[00:34:25] interact with it.
[00:34:27] This is a big issue in app
[00:34:29] design.
[00:34:31] Trust me, I have been there more
[00:34:33] than once.
[00:34:34] Trying to get people to change
[00:34:36] their mental model of how your
[00:34:38] app works is risky.
[00:34:40] This becomes even more true the
[00:34:42] more familiar people are with
[00:34:43] your app.
[00:34:45] Changes to any long-lived
[00:34:46] existing product will inevitably
[00:34:49] be hard for people to adjust to.
[00:34:50] It really doesn't matter how
[00:34:52] good or how necessary those
[00:34:54] changes may be.
[00:34:55] When considering big changes to
[00:34:57] an existing app, you have to be
[00:34:59] 100 percent positive that those
[00:35:02] changes will lead to clear wins
[00:35:04] for the people who currently use
[00:35:05] your app.
[00:35:06] Making changes just for the sake
[00:35:08] of it is not a good
[00:35:10] justification.
[00:35:11] Go carefully.
[00:35:12] Test your design.
[00:35:13] Prove to yourself beyond a
[00:35:15] shadow of a doubt that your
[00:35:17] innovations are objectively
[00:35:19] better.
[00:35:20] If you can do that, then it's
[00:35:22] good to push through.
[00:35:23] People will come around
[00:35:25] eventually.
[00:35:27] Okay. So it's time to start
[00:35:30] getting ready for dinner.
[00:35:31] So you decide to throw on that
[00:35:33] dope new Aloha shirt, and you
[00:35:35] exit the bathroom and you turn
[00:35:37] off the lights by flipping a
[00:35:38] switch.
[00:35:39] The sun is setting outside.
[00:35:41] It is a bit dark, so you turn on
[00:35:43] a light in the hallway.
[00:35:45] Then you walk over to the
[00:35:46] bedroom and you flip on another
[00:35:48] couple of light switches to turn
[00:35:50] the lights on out there.
[00:35:52] This, in a nutshell, is the
[00:35:54] design principle of proximity.
[00:35:58] Proximity is about the distance
[00:36:00] between a control and the object
[00:36:02] that it affects.
[00:36:04] The closer a control is to that
[00:36:06] object, the more we assume there
[00:36:08] to be a connection between the
[00:36:11] two.
[00:36:12] Of course the bathroom light
[00:36:14] switch is in the bathroom.
[00:36:15] Of course the hallway light
[00:36:16] switch is in the hallway.
[00:36:17] Of course the bedroom light
[00:36:19] switch is in the bedroom.
[00:36:21] Greater proximity also makes
[00:36:23] ergonomic sense.
[00:36:24] In general, the closer you are
[00:36:26] to an object or region of
[00:36:27] interest, the more likely you
[00:36:29] are to want to interact with it
[00:36:31] and control it.
[00:36:32] People think to turn on the
[00:36:33] bathroom light when they walk
[00:36:35] into the bathroom.
[00:36:35] So, by putting the light switch
[00:36:37] right by the door, it is within
[00:36:38] arm's reach when they need it
[00:36:40] most.
[00:36:42] Proximity is also useful for
[00:36:44] expressing relationships between
[00:36:46] controls.
[00:36:47] So, for example, if you see a
[00:36:48] set of switches on the wall, and
[00:36:50] you know that one of them
[00:36:51] controls lights, then it's
[00:36:54] reasonable for you to assume
[00:36:55] that every switch is a light
[00:36:57] switch.
[00:36:58] If one of them controls the
[00:37:00] shade, then it would be better
[00:37:02] to separate it out from the
[00:37:03] rest.
[00:37:04] This configuration makes it
[00:37:06] easier for people to remember
[00:37:08] which switch controls the shade,
[00:37:10] and which ones control the
[00:37:11] lights.
[00:37:13] Okay, now it's probably worth
[00:37:15] pointing out right now that we
[00:37:17] have a very special name for
[00:37:19] this configuration, this
[00:37:21] arrangement here on the right.
[00:37:22] Does anyone care to guess what
[00:37:24] it is?
[00:37:25] Just go ahead and shout it out.
[00:37:27] Okay, you're smart, you're not
[00:37:28] going to fall for it.
[00:37:28] I just tried to get you.
[00:37:31] Okay, if you guessed in your
[00:37:32] mind that it is a group, then
[00:37:34] you win a prize.
[00:37:35] It is a trip to Hawaii.
[00:37:37] Grouping is a very fundamental
[00:37:39] and significant design
[00:37:40] principle.
[00:37:42] Grouping helps people to
[00:37:43] understand the relationships
[00:37:44] between elements, and it is key
[00:37:46] for giving a design structure.
[00:37:49] Now, while we all understand
[00:37:50] this, many apps don't
[00:37:52] effectively use grouping.
[00:37:54] It can be easy to overlook.
[00:37:57] Now, let's take a look at a
[00:37:58] couple of examples of how
[00:38:00] proximity and grouping can be
[00:38:02] used to structure a design, and
[00:38:04] establish relationships between
[00:38:06] controls and the objects or
[00:38:08] views that they affect.
[00:38:10] And keynote, proximity helps us
[00:38:13] to associate the view menu with
[00:38:16] the slide navigator and the
[00:38:18] canvas area.
[00:38:18] The objects that it affects.
[00:38:21] The object creation tools are
[00:38:23] positioned right above the
[00:38:23] canvas, which is where those
[00:38:25] objects go.
[00:38:27] The anime format and document
[00:38:29] visibility switches are located
[00:38:31] just above where those panels
[00:38:32] get displayed.
[00:38:34] In Sketch, you can see how
[00:38:36] grouping is used to cluster
[00:38:38] related controls with each
[00:38:39] other, like the grouping
[00:38:41] controls.
[00:38:42] The Transform and Edit tools.
[00:38:44] The Pathfinding operations.
[00:38:46] And the Layer Ordering actions.
[00:38:50] Now, I just shared two Mac apps,
[00:38:52] and the need for proximity and
[00:38:54] grouping is definitely higher
[00:38:56] the larger your interface is,
[00:38:58] but the principles are still
[00:39:00] crucial for smaller screens,
[00:39:02] like iPads and iPhones, and even
[00:39:04] the Apple Watch.
[00:39:06] Okay, so I think there is time
[00:39:08] to learn about just one more
[00:39:10] design principle before we head
[00:39:11] downstairs to the hotel
[00:39:12] restaurant and grab some dinner.
[00:39:15] Let's go back to that Shade
[00:39:17] control again.
[00:39:18] Now, looking at this control, do
[00:39:20] you suppose that the Shade is
[00:39:22] open or closed?
[00:39:25] How about now?
[00:39:26] Just show of hands here.
[00:39:28] How many people think that it is
[00:39:29] closed?
[00:39:31] Okay, okay, and how many of you
[00:39:34] think that it is open?
[00:39:35] Yeah, you guys are a really
[00:39:38] smart group of people.
[00:39:39] All right.
[00:39:40] Mapping is how you know that it
[00:39:43] is closed.
[00:39:45] Mapping is about designing
[00:39:46] controls to resemble the objects
[00:39:48] that they affect.
[00:39:50] Shades go up, and shades go
[00:39:52] down.
[00:39:53] So it makes sense to use a
[00:39:54] control that mirrors that up and
[00:39:56] down movement.
[00:39:59] There is no ambiguity about how
[00:40:01] to raise or lower the shade.
[00:40:04] Mapping also relates to how
[00:40:05] controls are arranged relative
[00:40:07] to each other.
[00:40:09] Their order should resemble the
[00:40:10] configuration of the objects
[00:40:12] that they affect.
[00:40:13] So let's say that these light
[00:40:15] switches control three sets of
[00:40:17] ceiling lights in the bedroom.
[00:40:20] Good mapping involves arranging
[00:40:21] the switches to mirror the
[00:40:23] layout of those lights.
[00:40:26] By focusing on mapping, it is so
[00:40:28] much easier to make choices
[00:40:30] about where to position
[00:40:31] controls, how to order them, and
[00:40:33] even which controls to use.
[00:40:36] I mean, we've all seen light
[00:40:37] switches that look like this.
[00:40:40] You will often find labels when
[00:40:41] mapping is unclear.
[00:40:43] It is a telltale sign.
[00:40:45] But it is not a particularly
[00:40:47] good solution.
[00:40:48] Reading takes time, and it
[00:40:49] doesn't help people to memorize
[00:40:51] the location of controls or how
[00:40:53] they should interact with them.
[00:40:55] Now, in the context of
[00:40:56] interface, adjusting a
[00:40:57] horizontal property is much more
[00:40:59] intuitive with the horizontal
[00:41:01] slider.
[00:41:02] Similarly, using a dial for
[00:41:03] adjusting rotation is much
[00:41:05] better than a slider or a
[00:41:07] stepper.
[00:41:08] Of course, the best mapping is
[00:41:11] the most direct mapping.
[00:41:13] Providing the ability for people
[00:41:14] to directly manipulate an object
[00:41:16] is more straightforward, it's
[00:41:17] more intuitive, and precise.
[00:41:19] Whether that is with a pointer
[00:41:21] on macOS, or Gestures on iOS.
[00:41:25] Okay, so enough about light
[00:41:28] switches.
[00:41:28] I don't know about you, but I am
[00:41:30] starving, and it is time to head
[00:41:32] downstairs and get some dinner.
[00:41:35] Now, we all meet up in the lobby
[00:41:36] and we make our way over to the
[00:41:38] restaurant, and as you sit down
[00:41:39] at the table, you see in front
[00:41:41] of you an empty dinner plate.
[00:41:44] What can you do with this dinner
[00:41:46] plate?
[00:41:47] Well, of course, you can put
[00:41:50] food on it, #putfoodonit
[00:41:53] [laughter].
[00:41:54] But you can do all sorts of
[00:41:56] other stuff too.
[00:41:58] The plate is smooth, so it looks
[00:41:59] like it is easy to rotate and
[00:42:01] slide around.
[00:42:02] There is a nice little gap along
[00:42:04] the edge, so it looks easy to
[00:42:05] grab and lift up.
[00:42:07] It looks like a Frisbee, so you
[00:42:09] consider how far you can make it
[00:42:12] go.
[00:42:12] Or maybe not.
[00:42:14] Our notions about how we
[00:42:16] interact with this plate are
[00:42:18] called affordances.
[00:42:21] In other words, a plate's
[00:42:23] physical characteristics provide
[00:42:25] visual and tactile cues about
[00:42:27] what interactions the plate
[00:42:29] afford to us.
[00:42:31] A plate's physical
[00:42:32] characteristics make certain
[00:42:34] actions seem possible, and
[00:42:36] others less possible.
[00:42:37] We look at the plate, and we
[00:42:38] think, I am going to put food
[00:42:39] onto this object.
[00:42:41] Or, we might also think, I'm
[00:42:42] going to use this object to
[00:42:44] transport my food to a different
[00:42:45] location.
[00:42:47] We don't look at this plate and
[00:42:48] think, I'm going to use it for
[00:42:49] drinking water.
[00:42:51] Affordance is not an attribute
[00:42:53] of the object itself.
[00:42:55] It is more about the
[00:42:56] relationship that individuals
[00:42:58] have to an object.
[00:43:00] Affordance varies based on one's
[00:43:03] physical abilities.
[00:43:05] So, therefore, affordance varies
[00:43:07] from person to person.
[00:43:09] So, for example, this is kind of
[00:43:10] an extreme one.
[00:43:12] A Frisbee affords me with a
[00:43:13] possibility of catching and
[00:43:15] throwing.
[00:43:16] For my dog, a Frisbee affords
[00:43:18] the ability of catching, but not
[00:43:20] throwing.
[00:43:21] A plate affords me with the
[00:43:23] ability of eating food off of
[00:43:26] it.
[00:43:26] Interestingly, my dog perceives
[00:43:28] the very same affordance.
[00:43:30] Now, because affordance is
[00:43:32] subjective, one person can
[00:43:34] perceive an affordance when
[00:43:35] another does not.
[00:43:36] People are more likely to
[00:43:38] perceive an affordance when it
[00:43:39] is related to an action that
[00:43:40] they are more likely to take.
[00:43:42] So, for instance, I could use a
[00:43:45] plate as a saucer, and it would
[00:43:47] make a really great saucer.
[00:43:48] I don't think I would get any
[00:43:50] argument from you guys, but this
[00:43:53] is an unlikely action to take,
[00:43:55] so I wouldn't readily perceive a
[00:43:56] plate's glass-putting
[00:43:58] affordance, whereas I'm very
[00:44:00] likely to put food on it.
[00:44:02] So I readily perceive the
[00:44:03] plate's food-putting affordance.
[00:44:06] You perceive affordances with
[00:44:08] every environment and every
[00:44:10] object that you have ever
[00:44:11] interacted with.
[00:44:13] When you walked into the
[00:44:14] restaurant, you passed through a
[00:44:16] door that afforded you the
[00:44:17] ability of passage.
[00:44:19] The door is human-sized, so you
[00:44:21] can imagine your body moving
[00:44:22] through it unobstructed.
[00:44:24] There was a continuous grounds
[00:44:26] plane, so you can imagine
[00:44:27] yourself walking along it,
[00:44:29] without stumbling, tripping.
[00:44:31] The chair that you sat in
[00:44:33] affords the ability for sitting.
[00:44:35] The table in front of you
[00:44:37] affords the ability of putting
[00:44:38] objects onto it.
[00:44:40] The ground below your feet
[00:44:42] affords the ability for resting
[00:44:44] your feet.
[00:44:45] Manufactured objects include
[00:44:47] cues to evoke affordances.
[00:44:51] They let people know what
[00:44:52] actions are possible, and the
[00:44:54] obviousness and visibility of
[00:44:56] those cues helps people to know
[00:44:58] the correct or the intended ways
[00:45:00] of interacting, and the same
[00:45:02] should be true for apps.
[00:45:05] Sliders afford dragging a knob
[00:45:07] along a track.
[00:45:09] Dials afford rotating.
[00:45:11] Buttons afford tapping, and
[00:45:13] clicking.
[00:45:14] In each of these examples,
[00:45:16] affordance is communicated with
[00:45:18] maximum efficiency.
[00:45:20] In fact, over time, we are all
[00:45:22] becoming more comfortable with
[00:45:23] increasing levels of
[00:45:25] abstraction.
[00:45:26] The button, after all, is just a
[00:45:28] highly abstracted version of a
[00:45:30] physical, real-world button.
[00:45:33] All that's necessary to create a
[00:45:35] strong connection between the
[00:45:36] two are the rounding of the
[00:45:38] corners.
[00:45:39] A subtle drop shadow around the
[00:45:41] slider knob separates it from
[00:45:42] the track that it is positioned
[00:45:43] over, and this separation
[00:45:45] suggests that it can be moved
[00:45:46] independently.
[00:45:48] And even that visual cue might
[00:45:49] not be completely necessary.
[00:45:51] For most people, simply seeing a
[00:45:53] filled-in circle over a line is
[00:45:54] all that is needed to express a
[00:45:56] sliding affordance.
[00:45:59] And sometimes affordance is
[00:46:00] communicated using animation.
[00:46:02] Tapping on the Weather app, we
[00:46:04] see it slide up a little bit.
[00:46:05] This suggests the possibility
[00:46:07] that the content areas can be
[00:46:09] scrolled.
[00:46:10] And sure enough, they can.
[00:46:14] Regardless of the exact
[00:46:16] technique that you use, your
[00:46:17] app's interface must make clear
[00:46:19] what action possibilities it
[00:46:21] affords.
[00:46:22] If not, people won't know how to
[00:46:24] properly interact with it.
[00:46:26] They'll interact in ways that
[00:46:27] your app doesn't support, and
[00:46:28] they'll confuse controls for
[00:46:30] non-interactive objects.
[00:46:32] Okay. So, now that we know where
[00:46:35] our food is supposed to go, it
[00:46:37] is time to order.
[00:46:38] Now, I am thinking about getting
[00:46:39] a cheeseburger because they're
[00:46:42] delicious, obviously, and when a
[00:46:44] waiter comes by to take my
[00:46:45] order, I say, "Cheeseburger,
[00:46:47] please."
[00:46:48] He then asks how I would like it
[00:46:51] cooked, and "medium," I say.
[00:46:53] He then asks what kind of
[00:46:54] cheese, cheddar, Swiss, Jack,
[00:46:55] Gruyere, cottage?
[00:46:57] "Cheddar," I say.
[00:46:59] He then asks whether I would
[00:47:00] like bacon, egg, avocado on it?
[00:47:03] "None," I say.
[00:47:05] I am trying to keep my figure.
[00:47:08] He then asks whether I'd like
[00:47:09] salad, fries or onion rings.
[00:47:12] "Onion rings," I say.
[00:47:14] He then asks if I realize that
[00:47:15] cheeseburgers and onion rings
[00:47:16] are very high in calories, to
[00:47:18] which I reply, "Fake news"
[00:47:20] [laughter].
[00:47:21] This [applause] in a nutshell is
[00:47:32] the principle of progressive
[00:47:34] disclosure.
[00:47:35] Progressive disclosure is a
[00:47:37] technique for managing
[00:47:38] complexity.
[00:47:39] The term is used almost
[00:47:41] exclusively in the context of
[00:47:43] interaction design, and to my
[00:47:45] knowledge, this is the first
[00:47:46] time that anyone was dumb enough
[00:47:48] to try to use it to describe
[00:47:49] ordering a cheeseburger.
[00:47:51] The basic idea is this.
[00:47:53] Progressive disclosure gradually
[00:47:55] eases people from the simple to
[00:47:57] the more complex.
[00:47:59] And progressive disclosure is
[00:48:01] also about hiding away
[00:48:03] complexity, so that people can
[00:48:05] accomplish basic tasks with
[00:48:07] simple and more approachable
[00:48:09] interfaces.
[00:48:11] Ordering a cheeseburger would be
[00:48:12] way more complex and daunting if
[00:48:14] you had to consider all of those
[00:48:15] options at once.
[00:48:17] Customizing your cheeseburger is
[00:48:18] way easier when someone steps
[00:48:20] you through the process one
[00:48:22] decision at a time.
[00:48:24] And some choices that you make
[00:48:25] early on could make other
[00:48:27] choices irrelevant later.
[00:48:29] So, for example, if I'd asked
[00:48:31] for French fries, the waiter
[00:48:33] would have then asked whether I
[00:48:35] wanted regular, truffle or
[00:48:37] garlic fries, and because I
[00:48:39] didn't ask for fries, I don't
[00:48:40] really care what kind of French
[00:48:42] fries they have, and telling me
[00:48:44] about those options would just
[00:48:46] be a waste of my time and my
[00:48:48] limited mental abilities.
[00:48:51] Or would it be?
[00:48:53] I mean, I like garlic fries a
[00:48:55] lot, and had I known that garlic
[00:48:58] fries were on offer, I would
[00:48:59] have gotten them.
[00:49:01] So herein lies the rub.
[00:49:05] Progressive disclosure is a
[00:49:06] necessary and helpful technique
[00:49:09] for managing complexity and
[00:49:11] simplifying decision making.
[00:49:13] But the same technique can bury
[00:49:15] information or functionality.
[00:49:18] So what do you do?
[00:49:20] Well, discussions about how to
[00:49:22] properly use progressive
[00:49:23] disclosure often come down to
[00:49:24] the 80/20 rule.
[00:49:26] If you're not familiar, the
[00:49:27] 80/20 rule is a design principle
[00:49:29] that says in essence 80 percent
[00:49:33] of a system's effects come from
[00:49:35] 20 percent of its causes.
[00:49:38] For an app, this might mean that
[00:49:40] 80 percent of its benefit comes
[00:49:42] from 20 percent of the actions
[00:49:44] that it presents, or 80 percent
[00:49:47] of the people who use an app are
[00:49:48] only going to use 20 percent of
[00:49:51] its functions.
[00:49:52] Now, the exact percentages are,
[00:49:55] of course, different.
[00:49:56] But the basic point is valid.
[00:49:58] Not all information or
[00:49:59] functionality are created equal.
[00:50:02] Some is much more important than
[00:50:04] others.
[00:50:06] So, in order to reduce clutter,
[00:50:09] and simplify decision-making, it
[00:50:10] is a really good thing to use
[00:50:12] progressive disclosure to hide
[00:50:14] things of lesser importance.
[00:50:16] In other words, if your app is
[00:50:18] complex, it is okay to make the
[00:50:21] most useful 20 percent of
[00:50:22] functions easier to find by
[00:50:25] hiding the other 80 percent.
[00:50:28] A classic example of this is the
[00:50:29] print dialogue.
[00:50:31] Most of the time, people only
[00:50:33] care about the basics, which
[00:50:35] printer they're printing to, how
[00:50:36] many copies, what the range of
[00:50:38] pages are.
[00:50:39] These are way less than 20
[00:50:41] percent of the functions
[00:50:42] available, and it is what people
[00:50:44] want way more than 80 percent of
[00:50:47] the time.
[00:50:48] When more control is needed, a
[00:50:50] bunch of options are just one
[00:50:51] click away.
[00:50:52] Not only does progressive
[00:50:55] disclosure reduce visual
[00:50:56] clutter, and make printing less
[00:50:58] difficult, it also lowers the
[00:51:01] likelihood of people getting
[00:51:02] confused and changing a setting
[00:51:04] that they don't really
[00:51:05] understand.
[00:51:07] Most of us have experienced
[00:51:08] receiving this call from a
[00:51:10] parent, or a family member, or a
[00:51:12] friend, who is kind of freaking
[00:51:14] out because their computer is
[00:51:15] not working properly, and they
[00:51:17] changed something, and they
[00:51:18] don't really know what they did.
[00:51:20] This is why progressive
[00:51:22] disclosure is your best friend.
[00:51:25] By keeping things simple for
[00:51:27] novices, they are less likely to
[00:51:29] feel intimidated, overwhelmed,
[00:51:32] or get themselves into trouble,
[00:51:33] while more experienced users can
[00:51:35] quickly reveal the options and
[00:51:37] actions that they require, that
[00:51:39] they understand, and that they
[00:51:41] are capable of using.
[00:51:43] Okay. Anyhow, in case you were
[00:51:47] wondering, the cheeseburger and
[00:51:49] onion rings were delicious,
[00:51:51] thank you very much for asking.
[00:51:53] Okay, so it is time for us to
[00:51:55] get some sleep.
[00:51:56] We will be getting up early
[00:51:58] tomorrow, and we are going to be
[00:51:59] doing some snorkeling, so guys,
[00:52:01] rest up.
[00:52:02] Okay, did everyone sleep well?
[00:52:05] Was your room comfortable?
[00:52:06] Were you able to turn on your
[00:52:08] lights successfully?
[00:52:09] How is that Morty faucet?
[00:52:11] That was pretty weird, right?
[00:52:13] Okay, enough small talk.
[00:52:14] It is time for us to go see some
[00:52:15] fish.
[00:52:16] Now, after another highly
[00:52:18] successful car ride, we get to
[00:52:20] the beach, and you put on your
[00:52:21] goggles, and you put on your
[00:52:22] flippers, you adjust your
[00:52:24] snorkel just so, and you get
[00:52:26] into the water.
[00:52:27] Now, there are some tropical
[00:52:29] fish.
[00:52:30] There is a blowfish.
[00:52:33] There is a school of tuna fish.
[00:52:35] There is a giant squid, for some
[00:52:38] reason, because I had the emoji
[00:52:40] [laughter].
[00:52:41] It is a magical underwater
[00:52:44] wonderland.
[00:52:46] It is so utterly beautiful, but
[00:52:49] why?
[00:52:51] This brings us to our very last
[00:52:53] design principle.
[00:52:55] Symmetry. Symmetry is a concept
[00:52:58] that we are all deeply familiar
[00:52:59] with, and when we think about
[00:53:01] symmetry, we typically think
[00:53:02] about reflectional or bilateral
[00:53:04] symmetry.
[00:53:05] But there is more.
[00:53:07] There is also radial, and
[00:53:09] rotational symmetry.
[00:53:11] And there is also translational
[00:53:13] symmetry.
[00:53:16] These three types of symmetry
[00:53:18] are ubiquitous in nature.
[00:53:20] Symmetrical forms are efficient
[00:53:21] forms, and we tend to associate
[00:53:23] them with good health, with
[00:53:25] stability, balance, and
[00:53:27] orderliness.
[00:53:28] And we consider them to be
[00:53:29] aesthetically pleasing, probably
[00:53:32] for very good evolutionary
[00:53:33] reasons.
[00:53:35] Symmetrical elements, even if
[00:53:37] they are not physically
[00:53:38] connected to each other, are
[00:53:39] perceived as though they are.
[00:53:42] So when we see these two facing
[00:53:44] square brackets, our mind
[00:53:46] unconsciously integrates them
[00:53:49] into one coherent object.
[00:53:52] And as you swim around, you'll
[00:53:54] find all three forms of
[00:53:56] symmetry.
[00:53:57] Bilateral symmetry, rotational
[00:54:00] symmetry, and translational
[00:54:03] symmetry.
[00:54:05] As a matter of fact, just about
[00:54:07] every type of plant or animal,
[00:54:08] both in the sea, in the water,
[00:54:11] on land, in the air,
[00:54:13] demonstrates one or more types
[00:54:14] of symmetry.
[00:54:16] And most human-made objects do
[00:54:18] as well.
[00:54:19] Light switches are symmetrical
[00:54:21] across both the horizontal and
[00:54:23] vertical axes.
[00:54:25] Faucets are symmetrical.
[00:54:27] And cars are symmetrical.
[00:54:29] [Laughs] Now there is obviously
[00:54:31] some very practical functional
[00:54:34] reasons why cars are
[00:54:36] symmetrical.
[00:54:37] I mean, there is a very rational
[00:54:40] reason why you don't want to get
[00:54:42] into that car.
[00:54:44] But there are clearly aesthetic
[00:54:47] benefits as well.
[00:54:49] Attractive interfaces tend to
[00:54:51] demonstrate a mixture of
[00:54:52] reflectional and translational
[00:54:54] symmetry.
[00:54:55] In the Weather app, reflectional
[00:54:56] symmetry provides a sense of
[00:54:58] balance.
[00:54:59] Key elements are centered along
[00:55:01] a median line, while almost all
[00:55:03] of the other elements are
[00:55:04] counter-balanced with each
[00:55:05] other.
[00:55:07] This is a pattern which is
[00:55:08] reflected in apps like the
[00:55:10] Camera app, the Clock app, and
[00:55:14] the Phone app, and many, many
[00:55:16] more.
[00:55:18] Translational symmetry gives an
[00:55:20] interface a sense of structure,
[00:55:22] and order through the repetition
[00:55:24] of like elements.
[00:55:26] You can see translational
[00:55:27] symmetry in the even repetition
[00:55:29] of cities and times in the Clock
[00:55:31] app, or the even cadence of
[00:55:33] locations in the Weather app.
[00:55:36] When laying out your app's
[00:55:37] interface, look for
[00:55:39] opportunities to use symmetry to
[00:55:41] provide a sense of balance and
[00:55:43] order.
[00:55:44] Okay, so, everyone, I am sorry
[00:55:47] to be the bearer of bad news,
[00:55:48] but it's time for us to get out
[00:55:50] of the water.
[00:55:51] There are a lot of you, and we
[00:55:52] can only pay for a half day
[00:55:53] trip.
[00:55:54] Also, I don't know if you saw,
[00:55:56] there was a shark in the water,
[00:55:57] and I am really starting to
[00:55:58] freak out.
[00:55:59] So we return back to sunny San
[00:56:03] Jose.
[00:56:04] Now, the snorkeling here is not
[00:56:06] quite as beautiful as Hawaii,
[00:56:07] and I strongly urge you not to
[00:56:09] go into the bay.
[00:56:10] But our technical and design
[00:56:12] content is way better, so it's a
[00:56:14] win-win.
[00:56:15] Now, the design principles that
[00:56:17] we explored today express
[00:56:18] fundamental truths about human
[00:56:21] perception and cognition.
[00:56:23] They are simple, but powerful
[00:56:25] reminders about the true nature
[00:56:27] and purpose of design.
[00:56:30] They provide a framework for
[00:56:31] understanding, and a language
[00:56:33] for articulating a design's
[00:56:36] strengths and its shortcomings.
[00:56:39] My hope is that in sharing these
[00:56:41] principles with you today, you
[00:56:43] will come away with a clear
[00:56:45] sense of how your app's designs
[00:56:48] can help to fulfill those basic
[00:56:50] needs that we all share.
[00:56:53] The need to feel safe.
[00:56:55] The need to understand.
[00:56:57] The need to achieve our goals,
[00:56:59] and the need to experience
[00:57:01] beauty and joy.
[00:57:04] Now, to be sure, while these
[00:57:05] principles are, in many ways,
[00:57:07] quite simple, applying them to
[00:57:08] your work is not.
[00:57:11] Each of these principles could
[00:57:12] lead you into different
[00:57:13] directions about what you should
[00:57:15] do with the design of your app.
[00:57:18] Designing is so often about
[00:57:20] resolving those differences.
[00:57:22] This is something that the very
[00:57:23] best designers struggle with.
[00:57:26] It is also possible to have too
[00:57:28] much of a good thing.
[00:57:29] Too much feedback is annoying.
[00:57:31] Too much visibility is
[00:57:32] distracting.
[00:57:33] Too much progressive disclosure
[00:57:35] can make work flows inefficient.
[00:57:38] So you have to be measured in
[00:57:39] your approach, and exercise
[00:57:41] judgment and discretion.
[00:57:44] And the relevance of each
[00:57:46] principle can vary depending on
[00:57:48] what kind of app you're making.
[00:57:50] Platform. Screen size.
[00:57:52] Use case. The experience level
[00:57:55] of the people who you are
[00:57:56] designing for.
[00:57:57] These factors and more should
[00:57:59] influence what principles are
[00:58:01] most relevant at any given
[00:58:03] moment.
[00:58:05] Working through this can be
[00:58:06] challenging.
[00:58:07] No one said that designing is
[00:58:09] easy, but I do not want you to
[00:58:11] be discouraged.
[00:58:13] Designing is a lot easier when
[00:58:15] you understand the fundamentals.
[00:58:18] Let these principles be your
[00:58:20] North Star.
[00:58:22] They will guide you toward
[00:58:23] making apps that better serve
[00:58:26] the human beings that you are
[00:58:27] designing for.
[00:58:29] And that is the thing that
[00:58:31] matters most.
[00:58:33] And in turn, the people that you
[00:58:35] are designing for will
[00:58:36] recognize, on some level, all of
[00:58:39] the hard work that you have
[00:58:40] invested.
[00:58:42] They will appreciate the
[00:58:43] thoughtfulness and care, and
[00:58:46] they will sense the humanity of
[00:58:49] the people who made it.
[00:58:52] Okay, so for more information,
[00:58:55] check out this URL.
[00:58:56] And, I want to highlight how
[00:58:58] many amazing design sessions we
[00:59:00] have for you this week.
[00:59:01] We actually have eight design
[00:59:03] sessions, which is more than we
[00:59:06] have ever done before.
[00:59:07] We have three sessions that have
[00:59:08] five mini sessions in them each.
[00:59:10] There is a lot of fantastic
[00:59:12] content.
[00:59:13] In particular, I want to
[00:59:14] highlight a couple of sessions.
[00:59:16] One is called Designing Sound.
[00:59:18] It is being given by the person
[00:59:21] who makes basically all the
[00:59:22] sounds that are on your devices.
[00:59:24] It is nothing, like nothing we
[00:59:26] have ever done before.
[00:59:27] It is really fantastic.
[00:59:28] It is this afternoon.
[00:59:30] And you should go check out
[00:59:31] tomorrow, a presentation called
[00:59:33] Designing Across Platforms,
[00:59:35] which helps to solve really
[00:59:37] tricky issues about how to adapt
[00:59:39] your app to different platforms.
[00:59:41] It is really awesome.
[00:59:43] Okay, you guys, it has really
[00:59:44] been an honor and my pleasure to
[00:59:46] talk with you today.
[00:59:47] Thank you so much.
[00:59:49] [ Applause ]
