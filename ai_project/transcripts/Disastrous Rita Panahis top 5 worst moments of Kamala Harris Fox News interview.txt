Transcript:

[00:00:00] today was a bad day for the Camala
[00:00:03] Harris campaign her interview on Fox
[00:00:05] News was a train wreck a hot mess on a
[00:00:08] number of levels in Brett Bear she faced
[00:00:11] a real interviewer who asked pertinent
[00:00:13] questions about the Border inflation her
[00:00:16] record and she floundered she was
[00:00:19] evasive she was incoherent she was
[00:00:22] sometimes nonsensical whoever in her
[00:00:24] team thought she was ready for a real
[00:00:27] interview should be sacked immediately
[00:00:30] let's have a look at uh some of the more
[00:00:32] notable moments I could pay you the
[00:00:34] whole interview but we don't have the
[00:00:35] time your campaign slogan is a new way
[00:00:38] forward and it's time to turn the page
[00:00:40] you've been vice president for three and
[00:00:42] a half years so what are you turning the
[00:00:44] page
[00:00:45] from well first of all turning the page
[00:00:48] from the last
[00:00:50] decade in which we've been burdened with
[00:00:54] the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald
[00:00:56] Trump that has been designed and
[00:00:58] implemented to divide our country more
[00:01:01] than 7% people tell the country is on
[00:01:03] the wrong track they say the country is
[00:01:05] on the wrong track if it's on the wrong
[00:01:08] track that track follows three and a
[00:01:10] half years of you being vice president
[00:01:13] and President Biden being president that
[00:01:15] is what they're saying 79% of them why
[00:01:19] are they saying that if you're turning
[00:01:20] the page you've been in office for three
[00:01:22] and a half years and Donald Trump has
[00:01:25] been running for office but you've been
[00:01:28] the person holding the office
[00:01:31] I both know what I'm talking about you
[00:01:32] and I both know what I'm talking don't
[00:01:34] what are you talking about no one knows
[00:01:36] what you're talking about Camala you and
[00:01:38] Biden have been in power for almost four
[00:01:40] years the Democrats have been in power
[00:01:43] 12 over the last 16 years but everything
[00:01:46] is Donald Trump's fault apparently where
[00:01:48] turning the page from Trump now watch
[00:01:50] here as she tries to filibuster and
[00:01:53] mislead about what the Biden Harris
[00:01:55] administration's record on illegal
[00:01:57] immigration has been but for once for
[00:02:00] once her nonsense is called out cu this
[00:02:03] interviewer knows the facts how many
[00:02:06] illegal immigrants would you estimate
[00:02:09] your Administration has released into
[00:02:12] the country over the last three and a
[00:02:14] half years well I'm glad you raised the
[00:02:16] issue of immigration because I agree
[00:02:17] with you it is a it is a topic of
[00:02:20] discussion that people want to rightly
[00:02:22] have and you know what I'm going to talk
[00:02:25] about but just a number do you think
[00:02:27] it's 1 million 3 million Brett just get
[00:02:30] to the point okay the point is that we
[00:02:33] have a broken immigration system that
[00:02:35] needs to be repaired so your home and
[00:02:38] security secretary said that 85% of
[00:02:40] apprehension I'm not finished we have a
[00:02:42] we have rough estimate of 6 million
[00:02:44] people have been released into the
[00:02:46] country and let me just finish I'll get
[00:02:48] to the question I promise you I was
[00:02:49] beginning to answer and when when you
[00:02:51] came into office your Administration
[00:02:53] immediately reversed a number of trump
[00:02:55] border policies within hours of taking
[00:02:57] the oath was a bill to fix our
[00:02:59] immigration system yes ma'am it was
[00:03:01] called the US citizen Citizenship Act of
[00:03:04] 2021 it was essentially halfway to
[00:03:07] citizenship for finish may I finish may
[00:03:10] I finish responding please but you have
[00:03:12] to let me finish you had the White House
[00:03:14] and the house and the Senate and they
[00:03:15] didn't midd responding to the point
[00:03:18] you're raising and I'd like to finish
[00:03:20] yes
[00:03:21] ma'am we recognized from day one that to
[00:03:26] the point of this being your first
[00:03:27] question it is a priority
[00:03:30] for us as a nation and for the American
[00:03:33] people just waffle no answers she
[00:03:36] doesn't have anything significant
[00:03:39] substantial to say about these critical
[00:03:41] issues now watch here as Cala gets all
[00:03:44] heated up ranting and raving about Trump
[00:03:46] wanting to lock up his political
[00:03:48] opponents isn't that precisely what the
[00:03:50] Democrats have actually been doing he
[00:03:53] has talked about locking people up
[00:03:55] because they disagree with him this is a
[00:03:58] democracy and in a democracy the
[00:04:02] president of the United States in the
[00:04:03] United States of America should be
[00:04:06] willing to be able to handle criticism
[00:04:09] without saying he'd lock people up for
[00:04:12] doing it and on the question of
[00:04:14] emboldening and enriching the Iranian
[00:04:16] regime this is what Harris had to say
[00:04:19] critics just say that you either relaxed
[00:04:20] or failed to to enforce sanctions on
[00:04:22] Iran allowing all of this money to flow
[00:04:25] into Iran like billions let's go back to
[00:04:28] Donald Trump ped out who pulled out of a
[00:04:31] deal and the final highlight or should
[00:04:33] that be lowlight is when Brett Bear
[00:04:35] asked Camala when she finally noticed
[00:04:38] that Joe Biden had uh some issues with
[00:04:41] cognitive decline she is momentarily
[00:04:44] speechless call Donald Trump um he's
[00:04:48] misguided you say now he unstable he is
[00:04:51] unstable uh he's not well you say he's
[00:04:54] mentally not stable he's not stable let
[00:04:56] me ask you this you told many
[00:04:58] interviewers that Biden was on his game
[00:05:01] that ran around circles on his staff
[00:05:03] when did you first notice that President
[00:05:05] Biden's mental faculties appeared
[00:05:09] diminished Joe
[00:05:11] Biden I have watched in from the Oval
[00:05:14] Office to the situation room and he has
[00:05:17] the judgment and the experiment and
[00:05:20] experience to do exactly what he has
[00:05:22] done in making very important decisions
[00:05:25] on behalf of the American people then
[00:05:27] why are you the presidential candidate
[00:05:29] uh none of it makes any sense joining me
[00:05:31] now is Sky News contributor kosha Gator
[00:05:34] kosher she took a big gamble being
[00:05:37] interviewed by someone like Brett Bear
[00:05:39] who you've got to say it's not like she
[00:05:40] was interviewed by Shan Hannity or
[00:05:44] Tucker Carlson or Greg Gutfeld you you
[00:05:48] would expect that a presidential
[00:05:50] candidate could handle a tough
[00:05:52] interviewer who plays it straight down
[00:05:55] the line and she
[00:05:56] floundered she did take a Gamble and
[00:05:59] that is the million dollar question she
[00:06:00] would not she you could see she did not
[00:06:02] want to be there she couldn't get out of
[00:06:03] there fast enough and she did it cuz she
[00:06:06] has to this race is very very very tight
[00:06:08] and the momentum is with Trump and
[00:06:10] historically there is precedent where
[00:06:12] they begrudgingly the Democrat candidate
[00:06:14] begrudgingly will give one Fox news
[00:06:16] interview when there's 20 30 days left
[00:06:18] Obama did it Hillary did it it used to
[00:06:19] be with Bill O'Reilly so maybe she has
[00:06:21] to do that because they have a big
[00:06:22] audience a lot of Independents and
[00:06:24] actually frankly Democrats watch Fox
[00:06:26] News but she was not prepared she was
[00:06:28] not prepared to me the big takeaway is
[00:06:31] she remained substance free she does so
[00:06:34] by filibustering using filler words she
[00:06:37] said multiple times let's be clear let's
[00:06:39] be clear she's never clear and she hides
[00:06:42] behind others like she was she was she
[00:06:43] likes to hide behind the legislative
[00:06:45] branch cuz everything was like I will
[00:06:46] follow the law uh Congress needs to act
[00:06:49] so she shifts blame without ever
[00:06:52] weighing in on her position yes she
[00:06:53] doesn't pass laws but she can weigh in
[00:06:55] on which laws she think are better or
[00:06:57] not and she she wouldn't do it and he
[00:06:59] had her
[00:07:00] and he knew the facts when she brings up
[00:07:03] nonsense about this was the first thing
[00:07:05] we addressed and we had this bill well
[00:07:08] yeah that bill was just going to create
[00:07:10] a pathway to CI citizenship for millions
[00:07:13] of illegal immigrants that's not going
[00:07:15] to solve the Border crisis and and he
[00:07:18] knew that level of detail which and I've
[00:07:20] seen so many interviews with her where
[00:07:22] that's not followed up there really is
[00:07:24] uh yeah very frustrating to watch
