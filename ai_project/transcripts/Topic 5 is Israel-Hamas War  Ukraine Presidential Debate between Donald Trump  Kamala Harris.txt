[00:00:00] turning now to the Israel Hamas War and
[00:00:02] the hostages who are still being held
[00:00:04] Americans among them vice president
[00:00:06] Harris in December you said quote Israel
[00:00:09] has a right to defend itself but you
[00:00:10] added quote it matters how saying
[00:00:13] International humanitarian law must be
[00:00:15] respected Israel must do more to protect
[00:00:17] innocent civilians you said that nine
[00:00:20] months ago now an estimated 40,000
[00:00:22] Palestinians are dead nearly 100
[00:00:25] hostages remain just last week prime
[00:00:27] minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's
[00:00:29] not a deal in the making President Biden
[00:00:31] has not been able to break through the
[00:00:33] stalemate how would you do
[00:00:35] it well let's understand how we got here
[00:00:38] on October 7 Hamas a terrorist
[00:00:44] organization slaughtered 1200 Israelis
[00:00:48] many of them young people who were
[00:00:50] simply attending a concert women were
[00:00:53] horribly raped and so absolutely I said
[00:00:56] then I say now Israel has a right to
[00:00:59] defend itself we would and how it does
[00:01:02] so matters because it is also true far
[00:01:06] too many innocent Palestinians have been
[00:01:09] killed children
[00:01:11] mothers what we know is that this war
[00:01:15] must end it must when end immediately
[00:01:19] and the way it will end is we need a
[00:01:21] ceasefire deal and we need the hostages
[00:01:23] out and so we will continue to work
[00:01:26] around the clock on that work around the
[00:01:29] clock also Al understanding that we must
[00:01:31] chart a course for a two-state solution
[00:01:34] and in that solution there must be
[00:01:38] security for the Israeli people and
[00:01:40] Israel and an equal measure for the
[00:01:42] Palestinians but the one thing I will
[00:01:44] assure you always I will always give
[00:01:47] Israel the ability to defend itself in
[00:01:49] particular as it rates to as it relates
[00:01:52] to Iran and any threat that Iran and its
[00:01:55] proxies POs to Israel but we must have a
[00:01:58] two-state solution where we can rebuild
[00:02:00] Gaza where the Palestinians have
[00:02:03] security self-determination and the
[00:02:06] dignity they so rightly deserve
[00:02:08] president Trump how would you negotiate
[00:02:11] with Netanyahu and also Hamas in order
[00:02:13] to get the hostages out and prevent the
[00:02:16] killing of more innocent civilians in
[00:02:18] Gaza if I were president it would have
[00:02:20] never started if I were president Russia
[00:02:23] would have never ever I know Putin very
[00:02:26] well he would have never and there was
[00:02:27] no threat of it either by the way for
[00:02:29] four years
[00:02:30] have gone into Ukraine and killed
[00:02:32] millions of people when you add it up
[00:02:34] far worse than people understand what's
[00:02:36] going on over there but when she
[00:02:38] mentions about Israel all of a sudden
[00:02:41] she hates Israel she wouldn't even meet
[00:02:44] with Netanyahu when he went to Congress
[00:02:46] to make a very important speech she
[00:02:48] refused to be there because she was at a
[00:02:50] sority party of hers she wanted to go to
[00:02:52] the sority party she hates Israel if
[00:02:56] she's president I believe that Israel
[00:02:58] will not exist Within in two years from
[00:03:00] now and I've been pretty good at
[00:03:01] predictions and I hope I'm wrong about
[00:03:03] that one she hates Israel at the same
[00:03:06] time in her own way she hates the Arab
[00:03:09] population because the whole place is
[00:03:13] going to get blown up Arabs Jewish
[00:03:16] people Israel Israel will be gone it
[00:03:20] would have never happened Iran was broke
[00:03:23] under Donald Trump now Iran has $300
[00:03:26] billion because they took off all the
[00:03:28] sanctions that I had Iran had no money
[00:03:30] for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28
[00:03:34] different uh spheres of Terror and they
[00:03:37] are spheres of Terror horrible Terror
[00:03:39] they had no money it was a big story and
[00:03:42] you know it you covered it very well
[00:03:43] actually they had no money for Terror
[00:03:47] they were broke now they're a rich
[00:03:49] nation and now what they're doing is
[00:03:51] they're spreading that money around look
[00:03:54] at what's happening with the houis and
[00:03:57] Yemen look at what's going on in the
[00:03:59] Middle East this would have never
[00:04:01] happened I will get that settled and
[00:04:03] fast and I'll get the war with Ukraine
[00:04:05] and Russia ended if I'm president-elect
[00:04:08] I'll get it done before even becoming
[00:04:11] president vice president Harris he says
[00:04:13] you hate Israel oh that's absolutely not
[00:04:16] true I have my entire career and life
[00:04:20] supported Israel and the Israeli people
[00:04:22] he knows that he's trying to again
[00:04:25] divide and and distract from the reality
[00:04:29] which is it is very well known that
[00:04:32] Donald Trump is weak and wrong on
[00:04:34] National Security and foreign policy it
[00:04:36] is well known that he admires dictators
[00:04:40] wants to be a dictator on day one
[00:04:42] according to himself it is well known
[00:04:45] that he said of Putin that he can do
[00:04:49] whatever the hell he wants and go into
[00:04:52] Ukraine it is well known that he said
[00:04:54] when Russia went into Ukraine it was
[00:04:58] brilliant it is well known he exchanged
[00:05:01] love letters with Kim
[00:05:03] Jong-un and it is absolutely welln that
[00:05:07] these dictators and autocrats are
[00:05:09] rooting for you to be president again
[00:05:12] because they're so clear they can
[00:05:14] manipulate you with flattery and favors
[00:05:18] and that is why so many military leaders
[00:05:22] who you have worked with have told me
[00:05:25] you are a
[00:05:26] disgrace that is why we understand that
[00:05:30] we have to have a president who is not
[00:05:32] consistently weak and wrong on National
[00:05:35] Security including the importance of a
[00:05:37] holding and respecting in highest regard
[00:05:40] our military vice president Harris thank
[00:05:42] you they're the ones and she's the one
[00:05:45] that caused it that's weak on National
[00:05:47] Security by allowing Every Nation last
[00:05:50] month for the year 168 different
[00:05:53] countries sending people into our
[00:05:55] country their crime weights are way down
[00:05:58] Putin endorsed her l last week said I
[00:06:00] hope she wins and I think he meant it
[00:06:03] because what he's gotten away with is
[00:06:05] absolutely incredible it wouldn't have
[00:06:06] happened with me the leaders of other
[00:06:09] countries think that they're weak and
[00:06:11] incompetent and they are they're grossly
[00:06:14] incompetent and I just ask one question
[00:06:17] why does Biden go in and kill the
[00:06:19] Keystone Pipeline and approve the single
[00:06:22] biggest deal that Russia's ever made
[00:06:24] nordstream 2 the biggest pipeline
[00:06:26] anywhere in the world going to Germany
[00:06:27] and all over Europe because they weak
[00:06:30] and they're ineffective and Biden by the
[00:06:32] way gets paid a lot of money thank you
[00:06:34] we have a lot of issues to get to we'll
[00:06:35] be right back with much more of this
[00:06:37] historic ABC News presidential debate
[00:06:39] from the national Constitution Center
[00:06:40] right here in Philadelphia back in a
[00:06:46] moment when tropical weather threatens
[00:06:49] our home
