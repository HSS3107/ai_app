Why ChatGPT Creator OpenAI Is Having A Make Or Break Moment

Transcript:

[00:00:00] OpenAI has got the wind at its back.
[00:00:03] The OpenAI in talks now for a new funding round.
[00:00:05] Perhaps the biggest AI player out there.
[00:00:08] But the next act for the ChatGPT creator will be its
[00:00:11] toughest. Every organization.
[00:00:13] If they want to go public, they're going to have to
[00:00:15] reorganize and restructure the company before any of
[00:00:18] these investors can see some kind of massive return
[00:00:21] off of that.
[00:00:22] A high profile partnership with Apple.
[00:00:24] Iphone 16 raises the bar for what an iPhone can do.
[00:00:28] The next breakthrough and GPT-5 on the line, all led by
[00:00:32] a CEO who, depending on who you ask, is a visionary or
[00:00:36] a snake oil salesman.
[00:00:38] What do you think of OpenAI?
[00:00:39] Do you trust Sam Altman?
[00:00:41] Not a bit.
[00:00:43] I'm Deirdre Bosa and this is pardon the disruption.
[00:00:47] Here's why this is OpenAI's moment of truth.
[00:01:04] The higher the climb, the harder the fall, and OpenAI
[00:01:08] has climbed the tech ranks very quickly.
[00:01:11] Google ahead of Microsoft and ahead of Apple.
[00:01:13] Next month, those three giants have had to reorient
[00:01:16] their entire businesses around artificial intelligence
[00:01:19] because of what this one startup has done.
[00:01:22] And now the stage is set for one of its biggest tests
[00:01:25] yet, a partnership with Apple.
[00:01:27] We're integrating them right into your experiences, and
[00:01:31] we're starting out with the best of these; the pioneer
[00:01:34] and market leader ChatGPT from OpenAI.
[00:01:38] A $100 billion valuation, one of the few unicorns in
[00:01:41] history to even reach that level.
[00:01:43] It also signals this all out arms race we're seeing in
[00:01:46] the valley for these AI companies to get more cash.
[00:01:49] OpenAI with ChatGPT has been considered the leader.
[00:01:52] And now its founder is once again in the spotlight,
[00:01:55] bringing his particular brand of bold execution to one
[00:01:59] of the largest platforms in the world.
[00:02:02] You bring Sam Altman not because you're doing the
[00:02:04] partnership, but because he's the one that got
[00:02:06] everybody on board with ChatGPT in the first place,
[00:02:09] and he's going to signal to everybody watching this
[00:02:11] event that Apple is not going to be the one that's
[00:02:13] going to wait and watch, that this is the moment.
[00:02:16] ChatGPT it's coming to the iPhone, supercharging its
[00:02:19] reach, putting the chatbot in front of millions of
[00:02:22] users who may never have interacted with generative AI
[00:02:25] before.
[00:02:26] I'm also excited about a new generation of iPhone built
[00:02:30] from the ground up to deliver Apple intelligence and
[00:02:33] its breakthrough capabilities.
[00:02:35] It's high stakes, high pressure, there is little room
[00:02:38] for error. A tall ask for a company and a founder that
[00:02:42] has had a bumpy ride to the top.
[00:02:44] Major breaking news related to OpenAI.
[00:02:47] Steve Kovach joins us now.
[00:02:48] This is a stunner in some respects, Steve.
[00:02:51] Yeah, Sam Altman is out as CEO of OpenAI.
[00:02:54] We just got this announcement, Scott.
[00:02:56] I'll read you directly from the release.
[00:02:59] The board saying, quote, Mr.
[00:03:01] Altman's departure follows a deliberative review
[00:03:04] process by the board, which concluded that he was not
[00:03:07] consistently candid in his communications with the
[00:03:10] board.
[00:03:10] Altman ultimately survived that coup, returning in less
[00:03:13] than a week, but he has since lost some of the key
[00:03:16] people that helped build OpenAI in the first place.
[00:03:20] And OpenAI co-founder John Schulman is leaving the
[00:03:23] maker of ChatGPT to join Anthropic, an AI rival backed
[00:03:29] by Amazon.
[00:03:30] We learned about that major leadership exodus over at
[00:03:32] OpenAI as top talent, including two co-founders,
[00:03:35] announced their departures in just the past few days.
[00:03:38] Co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who took part in ousting
[00:03:41] Altman before reversing course and pushing for his
[00:03:44] return, will exit the board.
[00:03:47] At issue for many of them, Altman running OpenAI as a
[00:03:50] for profit company, one that no longer reflected the
[00:03:54] nonprofit structure it was founded on, and his vast
[00:03:57] investment empire, including his own venture capital
[00:04:00] firm and a slew of side projects raising questions
[00:04:03] about conflicts of interest.
[00:04:04] OpenAI says that Altman maintains transparency with
[00:04:08] the board about his occasional investments, and
[00:04:11] adheres to a process for managing potential conflicts
[00:04:14] of interest.
[00:04:15] Altman started OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit with the
[00:04:19] mission of advancing AI that would benefit humanity as
[00:04:22] a whole and, quote, unconstrained by a need to
[00:04:26] generate financial return.
[00:04:28] But building AI, it's expensive.
[00:04:31] It requires data servers, engineers, energy.
[00:04:33] The AI chips themselves run up into the hundreds of
[00:04:36] millions of dollars.
[00:04:38] OpenAI. It needed investors and investors will they
[00:04:42] want returns? So in 2019, it updated its structure.
[00:04:45] The current structure is unique, which might be an
[00:04:48] understatement. Equity is actually issued by OpenAI's
[00:04:50] for profit subsidiary, which is governed by the
[00:04:53] Nonprofit board.
[00:04:54] A very complex hybrid between a nonprofit entity and a
[00:04:58] for profit arm.
[00:05:00] And so I think that kind of structure is ultimately
[00:05:03] untenable. You can't be both.
[00:05:06] He's also been criticized by former colleagues for
[00:05:08] running OpenAI as a for profit company, no longer
[00:05:11] reflecting the nonprofit structure it was founded on.
[00:05:14] Its original focus on safe and responsible development
[00:05:18] that's made way for a very lucrative business model
[00:05:21] subscriptions licensing, a growing enterprise product,
[00:05:25] leading one of its co-founders, who left in 2018 to
[00:05:28] coin it, closed AI.
[00:05:30] This seemed weird that something can be, um, a
[00:05:35] nonprofit, uh, open source and somehow transform
[00:05:39] itself into a for profit closed source.
[00:05:43] I mean, this would be like like, let's say you funded
[00:05:45] an organization to save the Amazon rainforest, and
[00:05:47] instead they became a lumber company and chopped down
[00:05:51] the forest and sold it for money.
[00:05:53] And you'd be therefore like, well, wait a second.
[00:05:56] That's the exact opposite of what I gave the money
[00:05:58] for. Yeah. Is that legal?
[00:06:01] That doesn't seem legal.
[00:06:02] The test. Now, whether it can balance the tug of war
[00:06:04] between its nonprofit roots and a more realistic for
[00:06:07] profit future.
[00:06:09] Here's how Emil Michael, an early Uber executive who
[00:06:12] now invests in AI companies, would advise him.
[00:06:15] It's clear to the world now, but it certainly was
[00:06:17] getting clearer to the board of directors and the
[00:06:19] donors of which Elon Musk was a donor and a
[00:06:22] co-founder, that this was more going to be a for
[00:06:25] profit entity. If I were advising him, which I'm not
[00:06:27] on this subject, I'd say just be who you are.
[00:06:30] This is a for profit thing.
[00:06:32] Give the donations back to people who thought they
[00:06:34] were donating to, you know, a foundation.
[00:06:43] Sam Altman has been a long, recurring character in
[00:06:46] Silicon Valley tech circles with a work ethic to
[00:06:49] match.
[00:06:50] I've known him a little for a long time.
[00:06:52] He is responsive.
[00:06:54] You texting; can you talk?
[00:06:55] And before you can like hit send, he's calling you.
[00:06:59] Roots in entrepreneurship and venture capital, he is
[00:07:03] raising money at ever higher valuations and he's
[00:07:05] drawing interest from the biggest players in the tech
[00:07:08] world. Microsoft was first with an initial $1 billion
[00:07:11] investment in 2019 that quickly swelled to 13 billion,
[00:07:15] and now Apple and Nvidia may be poking around hoping
[00:07:18] to invest themselves and capitalize on OpenAI's
[00:07:21] winning streak.
[00:07:22] You might call it a party round.
[00:07:23] That's what they would call it in Silicon Valley.
[00:07:25] But you've got names like Microsoft, you've got Apple
[00:07:27] trying to back the hottest name in Silicon Valley.
[00:07:30] But some tech observers are throwing cold water, saying
[00:07:33] that OpenAI's sky high valuation does not match the
[00:07:36] returns.
[00:07:37] He's able to raise money at at these very, very high
[00:07:40] valuations without having to demonstrate the progress
[00:07:44] that he promised a year or two ago.
[00:07:46] And, you know, as long as those incentives are
[00:07:49] misaligned, you shouldn't trust him.
[00:07:51] And, you know, there's a lot of history here.
[00:07:53] And as an investor, I'm looking at this thing going,
[00:07:56] wow, it's interesting because the promises of two
[00:07:59] years ago and the promises of one year ago have not
[00:08:02] come true.
[00:08:03] The only thing that's come true is that he's raised
[00:08:05] more money at higher valuations.
[00:08:06] Michael though, says that big tech interest is more
[00:08:10] strategic.
[00:08:11] Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft are strategic investors,
[00:08:15] meaning they weren't just looking for financial
[00:08:17] return. They did it because they want to have some
[00:08:20] alignment with the technology that this company is
[00:08:23] building. Microsoft we know, uses it in their office
[00:08:27] products. Nvidia we know, makes a lot of money
[00:08:29] indirectly from OpenAI because OpenAI runs on a lot of
[00:08:32] their hardware. So they have a strategic interest in
[00:08:35] doing that.
[00:08:42] Generative AI has now become synonymous with OpenAI.
[00:08:45] After ChatGPT's launch in 2022 went viral and changed
[00:08:49] the entire conversation around what I can do.
[00:08:52] He's at a really the most important company, and he's
[00:08:56] raising a lot of money, and people are scared about
[00:08:59] what I could do and really excited about what I could
[00:09:03] do. So it's a focal point for the whole world right
[00:09:05] now.
[00:09:06] Since then, no one has been able to replicate that
[00:09:09] moment, not Microsoft, with reports of its flagship
[00:09:13] product, Copilot disappointing customers, not Apple,
[00:09:18] which is staggering, and pushing back the launch of
[00:09:20] some AI capabilities on the iPhone.
[00:09:22] Not even Google with its decade long lead in AI.
[00:09:26] It turns out it wasn't any of those well-capitalized,
[00:09:29] giant tech companies with the mainstream generative AI
[00:09:32] moment. It was Altman that got it done.
[00:09:35] People think of him as a technologist.
[00:09:37] He's actually a technologist and a and a great
[00:09:39] businessman, too.
[00:09:40] If anything, he was somewhat naive about this board
[00:09:43] coup. Maybe that's the one thing that he's got to make
[00:09:47] sure that he's being more paranoid, as I was, or
[00:09:50] Travis was at Uber about what could happen.
[00:09:54] And how do you insulate yourself against other
[00:09:57] people's interests kind of getting misaligned with
[00:09:59] yours.
[00:10:00] Now, a new race is on.
[00:10:01] Big Tech and OpenAI, they're developing the next, more
[00:10:05] advanced phase of AI, getting closer to artificial
[00:10:08] general intelligence, where machines could perform
[00:10:11] tasks with human like intelligence.
[00:10:14] OpenAI will be under intense scrutiny to ensure that
[00:10:17] GPT-5 is safe, transparent and reliable, and it wants
[00:10:21] to get there first.
[00:10:22] Another GPT moment in the AI arms race.
[00:10:25] Jensen Huang, the AI King maker himself.
[00:10:28] He says that the glory and the leadership goes to the
[00:10:31] person or company with the breakthrough, not the
[00:10:34] incremental advance.
[00:10:36] The first person to the next plateau gets to introduce
[00:10:39] a revolutionary level of AI.
[00:10:41] The second person who gets there is incrementally, you
[00:10:44] know, better or about the same.
[00:10:46] So the ability to systematically and consistently race
[00:10:51] to the next plateau and be the first one there is how
[00:10:54] you establish leadership.
[00:10:56] That leadership is now OpenAI's to lose.
