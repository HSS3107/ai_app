[00:00:00] AI agents are taken the World by storm
[00:00:02] in 2024 but AI agents cannot build
[00:00:06] themselves at least not yet even Tech
[00:00:08] giants like Google are recognizing the
[00:00:11] potential here with their own agentic
[00:00:13] platforms and it's not just Google a
[00:00:15] wave of stas products are now ditching
[00:00:17] traditional chatbots in favor of more
[00:00:19] advanced agent based systems and
[00:00:22] although some of these platforms haven't
[00:00:24] changed a thing beyond the copy on their
[00:00:26] lending Pages it's evident that the role
[00:00:29] of an AI agent developer will be one of
[00:00:32] the most sought after jobs of 2024
[00:00:35] However unfortunately because it's still
[00:00:37] so early no one really understands what
[00:00:40] exactly to look for leave alone how to
[00:00:42] become one so in this video I will
[00:00:45] finally demystify who an AI agent
[00:00:47] developer is what skills you'll need to
[00:00:50] become one and most importantly provide
[00:00:52] you with a complete road map that you
[00:00:54] can follow by yourself right now let's
[00:00:56] Dive In
[00:01:01] all right before we jump in I'm sure you
[00:01:03] might be asking who am I and why do you
[00:01:06] have to listen to me and what I have to
[00:01:08] say about AI agents so allow me to
[00:01:11] introduce myself my name is arson and
[00:01:13] I'm currently running one of the most
[00:01:15] popular AI agent Frameworks on GitHub
[00:01:17] that allows you to create agencies with
[00:01:19] AI called agencies form but that's not
[00:01:21] all I'm also running my own AI agency
[00:01:23] where we recently launched the first of
[00:01:26] its kind agents as a service
[00:01:27] subscription so unlike other influen
[00:01:30] answers I'm not making my living selling
[00:01:32] you ads I actually make all of my income
[00:01:35] delivering real world AI Solutions in
[00:01:37] fact just in the past month I've hired
[00:01:39] two AI agent developers myself so
[00:01:42] hopefully this now gives you an idea
[00:01:44] that I've got a pretty good
[00:01:45] understanding of what to look for okay
[00:01:47] with that out of the way allow me to
[00:01:49] break down what AI agents are I've
[00:01:52] previously talked about this on my
[00:01:54] channel so if you want to dive into more
[00:01:55] details please make sure to watch this
[00:01:57] video after here I'm just going to give
[00:01:59] you a brief overview because
[00:02:01] understanding how to think about AI
[00:02:03] agents will significantly impact your
[00:02:06] approach to building them from what I've
[00:02:08] heard so far typically most of AI
[00:02:11] influencers either Define them as
[00:02:13] automations or as your own employees in
[00:02:16] my opinion both of these definitions are
[00:02:19] extremely misleading on the one hand AI
[00:02:21] agents have a lot more autonomy than
[00:02:24] automations AI automations run on your
[00:02:26] back end no matter what even if the
[00:02:29] whole world Burns RS down EI automation
[00:02:31] is just going to keep running like
[00:02:32] nothing happened on the other hand eii
[00:02:35] agents have less autonomy than your own
[00:02:37] employees because your employees can
[00:02:39] defy you you can provide them with as
[00:02:41] many instructions as you want but they
[00:02:43] can still consider things on their own
[00:02:45] and do them in their own way so the
[00:02:47] closest definition to AI agents that
[00:02:50] I've ever heard was made by Andre
[00:02:51] karpathy who said that AI agents are
[00:02:54] essentially operating systems yeahi
[00:02:56] agents fall in between employees and out
[00:02:59] automations they have Ram which is
[00:03:01] memory they have access to tools and
[00:03:03] they can use other llms and reflect upon
[00:03:06] their own actions why am I telling you
[00:03:08] this well because often times I've
[00:03:10] noticed that some of you guys are trying
[00:03:13] to make your agents perform literally
[00:03:16] everything by themselves this in my
[00:03:18] opinion is wrong you shouldn't just tell
[00:03:21] your agent what you want and then hope
[00:03:23] it's going to do it all for you your
[00:03:25] agent should only route the requests
[00:03:27] from the user to the tools all of the
[00:03:29] heavy lifting must be performed by the
[00:03:31] tools not by your agents think of it as
[00:03:34] your own OS like Windows or Mac where we
[00:03:38] have different apps for specific
[00:03:40] purposes we don't even consider how
[00:03:42] these apps function we simply control
[00:03:44] them and the same should apply to your
[00:03:46] agents you can't just tell them what you
[00:03:48] want and then sit back and wait until
[00:03:50] you become a millionaire unfortunately
[00:03:52] this does not work out yet and at this
[00:03:54] point the most significant challenge
[00:03:56] that prevents Mass adoption of EI agents
[00:03:58] is their real ability currently to make
[00:04:01] agents reliable you need to carefully
[00:04:03] fine-tune them on a specific business
[00:04:05] process and this is exactly where AI
[00:04:08] agent developers come in as an AI agent
[00:04:10] developer Your Role is to ensure that
[00:04:13] your agents have access to all the
[00:04:15] necessary resources tools and knowledge
[00:04:18] to perform their designated tasks
[00:04:20] essentially what it entails is first
[00:04:22] conducting thorough research about the
[00:04:24] business and determining which of those
[00:04:25] resources the agent will need then you
[00:04:28] need to create the tools as as I said
[00:04:30] tools are the most important while
[00:04:32] building your agency you have to
[00:04:34] constantly iterate in it gather feedback
[00:04:36] from the stakeholders and adjust it in
[00:04:38] the loop until it performs consistently
[00:04:40] from time to time and finally you must
[00:04:42] actually deploy your agents which is a
[00:04:44] step that a lot of people Skip and then
[00:04:46] integrate them into your client's
[00:04:48] business you have to make sure that
[00:04:49] these agents work seamlessly alongside
[00:04:52] their own employees now what skills
[00:04:54] required to become an AI agent developer
[00:04:57] well as for the soft skills definitely
[00:04:59] communication and eagerness to learn
[00:05:02] communication because you'll often find
[00:05:04] yourself Gathering requirements from the
[00:05:06] stakeholders and setting clear
[00:05:08] expectations which is not an easy task
[00:05:11] and eagerness to learn because we're
[00:05:13] still in a very early stages with
[00:05:15] advancements in AI emerging all the time
[00:05:18] so you have to be able to adapt very
[00:05:20] quickly and as for the hard skills
[00:05:22] primarily it will be light backend
[00:05:24] development combined with AI so now can
[00:05:27] anyone become an AI agent developer in
[00:05:30] 2024 in my opinion yes anyone can do
[00:05:33] this because imagine if you were trying
[00:05:35] to excel in a subject like math and
[00:05:37] you'd be up against people who' spend
[00:05:40] their entire lives mastering it however
[00:05:42] when it comes to AI agent development
[00:05:44] you'll only be competing with people who
[00:05:46] have at least a few months of experience
[00:05:49] so in my opinion the timing is just
[00:05:51] right even if you're a beginner now I'm
[00:05:54] sure that you guys might be wondering if
[00:05:57] coding will be necessary or if some no
[00:06:00] code platforms will suffice in the
[00:06:02] future well the short answer is yes
[00:06:04] coding will be necessary here's why
[00:06:07] first of all the most powerful tools
[00:06:09] that your agent will use will always
[00:06:11] require some coding experience sure you
[00:06:14] can connect your agents to off the
[00:06:15] shelf's apis but typically in real world
[00:06:18] scenarios we always create those proxy
[00:06:21] end points even if we connect to Off the
[00:06:23] Shelf API this gives us a lot more
[00:06:24] control over the behavior of the tool
[00:06:27] for example we can process the input
[00:06:28] data and output data as we see fit
[00:06:31] moreover a lot of those tools do require
[00:06:34] multiple apis together or some custom
[00:06:36] logic inside secondly open source will
[00:06:39] always lead the way not in a sense of
[00:06:41] developing the most powerful models but
[00:06:44] in a sense of actually using them in
[00:06:46] Creative projects SAS platforms often
[00:06:48] require thorough testing and a lot more
[00:06:50] time to release new features open source
[00:06:52] reers like my agency's War framework can
[00:06:55] adapt to new advancements in AI much
[00:06:57] faster and lastly man of my clients are
[00:07:00] extremely concerned about data privacy
[00:07:03] for them SAS platforms are not even an
[00:07:05] option they want to deploy agents on
[00:07:07] their own existing infrastructures so
[00:07:10] while SAS platforms will definitely
[00:07:12] evolve over time and they might satisfy
[00:07:14] some of our client needs in the future I
[00:07:16] believe that learning to code will still
[00:07:18] be a non-negotiable moreover with the
[00:07:21] Advent of AI coding tools coding is
[00:07:23] literally becoming Ain to using another
[00:07:25] SAS platform because you can already
[00:07:28] code using only n natural language so
[00:07:30] the learning curve is nowadays much
[00:07:32] smoother and there is no longer a need
[00:07:34] to learn any complex data structures or
[00:07:37] algorithms you just have to know them on
[00:07:38] a high level so you know what questions
[00:07:41] to ask the rest AI can already do for
[00:07:44] you my road map factors in all of those
[00:07:46] AI coding tools so let's now take the
[00:07:49] first step which is to find a good
[00:07:51] project yes guys I can't emphasize this
[00:07:54] enough you can start without a project
[00:07:57] if you don't use it you lose it
[00:07:59] everything that you learn without a
[00:08:01] project you will simply not retain on
[00:08:03] the other hand having a real world
[00:08:05] project from the start will give you
[00:08:07] your own lens through which you can
[00:08:08] interpret all of the following
[00:08:10] information and the best way to find a
[00:08:12] good project is to think about your own
[00:08:15] interests and how they could intersect
[00:08:17] with AI your Niche is essentially where
[00:08:20] AI combines with your talents all of the
[00:08:23] obvious applications for L language
[00:08:25] models have already been capitalized
[00:08:27] upon if you were to create another EA
[00:08:29] agent for research for example you'd be
[00:08:31] up against tens of Open Source and
[00:08:33] Commercial projects providing this exact
[00:08:36] service however the real opportunity
[00:08:38] lies in merging AI with your own unique
[00:08:41] interests this is how you can find those
[00:08:43] untapped use cases that make Captivate
[00:08:46] other people just like you for example I
[00:08:48] used to be into EDM so I could create an
[00:08:51] AI agent that would send me the latest
[00:08:52] hits create media files with a custom
[00:08:54] coded tool generate certain sounds with
[00:08:56] 11 laps API or even entire song when a
[00:08:59] company like yudo releases their own
[00:09:03] API so start by scoping an initial
[00:09:06] agentic project include how many agents
[00:09:09] you want to create what each agent will
[00:09:11] do and what tools they will use
[00:09:13] additionally it's helpful to determine
[00:09:15] the overall goals and the desired
[00:09:19] outcomes of the system if you want to
[00:09:21] download my notion template for scoping
[00:09:23] an agentic project that we use in our
[00:09:26] agency almost every day please feel free
[00:09:28] to use the link below it's going to ask
[00:09:29] you for your email I'll explain why at
[00:09:32] the end of this video once your project
[00:09:34] is fully scoped you're ready to move to
[00:09:36] the next step which is the environment
[00:09:37] setup your development environment is
[00:09:40] where you'll be spending most of your
[00:09:42] time so it's important to nail it down
[00:09:44] from the very start first you'll need an
[00:09:46] IDE this is the software you'll use to
[00:09:49] write and test your code there are many
[00:09:51] idees to choose from but some of the
[00:09:53] most popular ones are visual studio code
[00:09:56] jet brains and X code I personally
[00:09:58] prefer jet brains but it's not free
[00:10:00] although you can get it for free if
[00:10:02] you're currently a student next you'll
[00:10:04] need to install python python is the
[00:10:07] most commonly used language for AI
[00:10:09] development literally the entire AI
[00:10:11] industry runs on python it's also a
[00:10:14] great language for beginners because
[00:10:15] it's extremely easy to read just follow
[00:10:17] all the installation steps on their main
[00:10:19] website and if you run into any issues
[00:10:22] just send them to chpt please don't send
[00:10:24] them into comments after that you'll
[00:10:26] need to figure out package management
[00:10:28] this is how you'll install and manage
[00:10:29] the various libraries and tools you'll
[00:10:31] use in your project messing up package
[00:10:33] management is the single most common
[00:10:35] regret for all python developers
[00:10:38] remember that you should never install
[00:10:40] packages globally for a specific project
[00:10:42] and always create separate virtual
[00:10:44] environments I recommend using a tool
[00:10:46] like K however python also has a
[00:10:48] built-in package manager called vnf
[00:10:51] finally you'll need to find your AI
[00:10:53] development tools as I said these are
[00:10:55] crucial in 2024 honestly I personally
[00:10:58] barely even C code myself I just check
[00:11:00] code provided by AI some of the most
[00:11:03] popular ones are GitHub copilot cursor
[00:11:06] chpt Amazon code Whisperer and even your
[00:11:08] own agent like David I recommend cursor
[00:11:11] at the start which is an AI first IDE
[00:11:13] Fork from vs code it's one of those rare
[00:11:16] tools that strike the right balance
[00:11:18] between coding and using AI they are
[00:11:20] also backed by open AI once your
[00:11:23] environment is ready to go it's time to
[00:11:25] start coding so the next step is to
[00:11:28] learn the basics at this stage I do not
[00:11:31] recommend diving into too much detail
[00:11:33] you just need to learn programming at a
[00:11:35] relatively high level there are many
[00:11:36] resources available online to Learn
[00:11:38] Python quickly you can find tutorials on
[00:11:41] YouTube or you can even read books like
[00:11:42] learning python which is what I did in
[00:11:45] my early days however what you can do
[00:11:47] now is also create your own agent or a
[00:11:49] custom GPT upload this entire book all
[00:11:52] of those YouTube videos and use it to
[00:11:54] assist you with your learning process
[00:11:56] another great way is to clone a
[00:11:58] repository on GitHub that you really
[00:12:00] admire and go through it with AI ask
[00:12:03] questions about specific lines of code
[00:12:05] that you don't understand then try to
[00:12:07] modify this repo or add some new
[00:12:09] features feel free to try this out with
[00:12:11] my own framework and submit a PR if you
[00:12:14] create something cool next you'll need
[00:12:15] to learn git git is a version control
[00:12:18] system that lets you track code changes
[00:12:20] and collaborate with others this is
[00:12:21] important because sometimes as an agent
[00:12:24] developer you might have to collaborate
[00:12:26] with your client development team again
[00:12:28] there are many resources available to
[00:12:30] learn git you can find tutorials on
[00:12:32] YouTube or you can use tools like GitHub
[00:12:34] copilot CLI a new addition to GitHub
[00:12:37] copilot that explains or even creates
[00:12:39] any terminal commands for you fireship
[00:12:41] also has a great course on git that I
[00:12:44] personally recommend once you've got the
[00:12:45] handle on the basics the next step is to
[00:12:49] learn the modern AI development text tag
[00:12:52] the first skill you absolutely need to
[00:12:54] master is an AI agent developer after
[00:12:56] you learn the basics is the use of llm
[00:12:59] apis currently the leading players in
[00:13:01] the field are open AI anthropic and
[00:13:04] Google Gemini in my opinion open AI is
[00:13:06] at least a few months ahead of everyone
[00:13:09] although they were extremely slow with
[00:13:11] releases recently so I definitely
[00:13:13] recommend starting with open AI also in
[00:13:15] my opinion although the gap between open
[00:13:18] stores and commercial models will shrink
[00:13:20] over time commercial will always be
[00:13:22] ahead feel free to disagree with me in
[00:13:24] the comments so explore open a API and
[00:13:27] try to create an agent from scratch
[00:13:28] don't use any Frameworks or libraries
[00:13:31] equip it with tools using only custom
[00:13:33] code and try to fine-tune it on a simple
[00:13:36] task this will give you a much better
[00:13:38] understanding of how e agents work
[00:13:40] internally however don't stop on just
[00:13:43] commercial model apis sometimes there is
[00:13:45] a need to deploy or fine-tune an open
[00:13:48] source model because of data privacy I
[00:13:50] am also currently working on adding a
[00:13:52] new way to use my framework with open
[00:13:54] source models and if this proves
[00:13:56] successful I will let you know so it's
[00:13:58] important to know how to reuse existing
[00:14:01] AI models in 2024 but I would not
[00:14:03] recommend learning to train your own AI
[00:14:06] from scratch as I said in one of my
[00:14:08] previous videos AI is just becoming way
[00:14:11] too complex secretive and expensive
[00:14:13] there is absolutely no way you can train
[00:14:16] any breakthrough model by yourself
[00:14:18] instead try fine-tuning or deploying
[00:14:20] existing models on a platform like
[00:14:22] huging phas they offer convenient
[00:14:24] deployment options and a convenient way
[00:14:26] to fine-tune those models so I've
[00:14:29] actually released videos on how to do
[00:14:31] both on my channel as well and finally
[00:14:33] you'll need to learn function calling
[00:14:35] function calling is a feature that
[00:14:36] allows llms to call external functions
[00:14:39] this is how your agents interact with
[00:14:42] the outer world and this is why it's the
[00:14:44] most important part of the entire system
[00:14:46] in our agency we don't measure results
[00:14:49] of our systems by analyzing the outputs
[00:14:52] of the messages instead we measure our
[00:14:54] results by analyzing the actions that
[00:14:57] those agents take I recommend exploring
[00:15:00] the instructor Library which is a
[00:15:02] project developed by Jason Leo that
[00:15:04] conveniently combines penic with
[00:15:06] function calls essentially it allows you
[00:15:09] to validate all the inputs provided by
[00:15:11] your agents before executing any logic
[00:15:14] inside those function calls so my
[00:15:16] framework depends on instructor for all
[00:15:18] custom tools and Json also has a
[00:15:21] detailed documentation with many great
[00:15:23] examples after that the next step is to
[00:15:25] learn multi-agent Frameworks the most
[00:15:28] popular ones are currently autogen crew
[00:15:30] eii and my own framework agency form
[00:15:32] I've previously discussed all of them on
[00:15:34] my channel and I also released many
[00:15:36] tutorials on how to use my own framework
[00:15:38] so I won't go into too much details here
[00:15:41] if you prefer another framework there
[00:15:43] are also plenty of tutorials on YouTube
[00:15:46] essentially all these Frameworks do is
[00:15:48] just handle some of the underlying
[00:15:50] details for running your agent-based
[00:15:51] systems such as multi-agent
[00:15:53] communication function execution and
[00:15:55] State Management there is an intricate
[00:15:57] balance however between between having
[00:15:59] control over your systems and being able
[00:16:01] to get started fast my framework is
[00:16:04] definitely heavily skewed towards
[00:16:05] control and customization rather than
[00:16:07] the ease of use it provides you with
[00:16:10] full access over your agents without any
[00:16:12] hardcoded prompts or any hardcoded
[00:16:15] agents even like in other Frameworks so
[00:16:18] other Frameworks might definitely be
[00:16:19] easier to get started with because you
[00:16:21] don't have to create all of those Proms
[00:16:23] and agents yourself but they might be
[00:16:26] too restrictive if you're building
[00:16:27] anything more complex than a trip
[00:16:29] planner now there is one crucial step
[00:16:31] that a lot of people skip which is
[00:16:33] actually deploying your agents in
[00:16:35] production this is why next you do have
[00:16:37] to learn some light backend API
[00:16:39] development you can start by deploying a
[00:16:41] simple model via API there are many ways
[00:16:44] to do this for example you can use
[00:16:46] Firebase functions AWS Lambda or even
[00:16:49] create your own server with flask or
[00:16:50] fast API I recommend using serverless
[00:16:53] because the number of requests your
[00:16:55] agent receives can vary significantly
[00:16:57] from time to time therefore you need a
[00:16:59] scalable solution to learn quickly the
[00:17:01] best way is to chat with chat GPT it
[00:17:04] knows surprisingly well all of those
[00:17:05] infrastructure providers like Google
[00:17:07] Cloud AWS and Azure Google Cloud also
[00:17:10] has recently introduced their own
[00:17:12] assistant powered by Gemini which can be
[00:17:14] used directly from their console you can
[00:17:16] simply ask how to create a serverless
[00:17:17] function and it will provide you with an
[00:17:19] exact step-by-step process to follow and
[00:17:21] if you encounter any issues of course
[00:17:23] you can send them back and it will help
[00:17:25] you to resolve it once you've deployed
[00:17:26] your agent as an API try integrating it
[00:17:29] into a channel like slack or Discord or
[00:17:31] you could even go farther and try
[00:17:33] creating your own chat user interface
[00:17:34] using a platform like verel VZ front-end
[00:17:37] development could be helpful sometimes
[00:17:39] however it's not a requirement once
[00:17:41] you've shared your project with the
[00:17:43] world the final step is to monetize it
[00:17:46] making money is hands down the best way
[00:17:47] to learn because you also get paid for
[00:17:50] it and to do this effectively you must
[00:17:52] productize your service you must reuse
[00:17:54] as much of the previous code as possible
[00:17:56] you should create templates for each
[00:17:58] step of the process like deploying
[00:18:00] agents creating tools or even creating
[00:18:02] agent templates sometimes that could be
[00:18:04] helpful although I do not recommend
[00:18:05] using it all the time after that you
[00:18:07] need to find your first client there are
[00:18:09] three means you can find your first
[00:18:11] client number one is freelance platforms
[00:18:13] this is the easiest and the fastest way
[00:18:15] to find a client without making
[00:18:17] significant time and money Investments I
[00:18:19] think AI agent development fits quite
[00:18:21] well with freelancing because the
[00:18:23] projects are relatively shortterm
[00:18:25] besides There is almost no competition
[00:18:27] for a agent deps on these platforms yet
[00:18:29] this is how I personally got started I
[00:18:31] used to work as an eii freelancer on upw
[00:18:33] work which gave me a ton of experience
[00:18:35] because I was working with many
[00:18:37] different companies on various projects
[00:18:40] across all modalities like audio Vision
[00:18:43] NLP and so on my tip for you here is to
[00:18:45] create your own project offers and let
[00:18:47] your clients find you instead of sending
[00:18:49] proposals number two cold Outreach cold
[00:18:52] Outreach involves sending code emails
[00:18:54] and DMS to companies offering your
[00:18:56] service this method requires a lot more
[00:18:59] effort but it can also lead to higher
[00:19:01] paying clients I don't have much
[00:19:02] experience doing cold Outreach but my
[00:19:05] tip for you is to always schedule a call
[00:19:07] instead of trying to sell your solution
[00:19:09] via emails and finally you can find a
[00:19:12] full-time job you'd be surprised how
[00:19:14] many companies are actually looking for
[00:19:16] a agent developers right now and the
[00:19:18] best way to find such a company is to
[00:19:20] look for startups that recently received
[00:19:22] funding our team is also currently on
[00:19:24] the lookout for agent developers so if
[00:19:26] you have already completed all of the
[00:19:28] previous steps you can reach out to us
[00:19:30] on our Discord remember the goal is not
[00:19:32] just to make money but to learn and grow
[00:19:34] as you go and to wrap this up I just
[00:19:36] wanted to share a bonus tip with you
[00:19:38] which is to build your own community
[00:19:40] building a community requires a
[00:19:42] substantial time investment however if
[00:19:44] you have a community and if you
[00:19:46] understand the needs and challenges that
[00:19:47] your community is currently facing you
[00:19:49] can tailor your services specifically
[00:19:51] for them this will not only help you
[00:19:53] stand out but will also provide you with
[00:19:55] extremely valuable feedback so as I said
[00:19:57] I personally started as as a freelancer
[00:19:59] on upwork yet about a year ago I decided
[00:20:01] to start this YouTube channel I thought
[00:20:03] that maybe by this time I would get my
[00:20:06] first client from YouTube however
[00:20:07] believe it or not my first client found
[00:20:10] me on my second video when I had only
[00:20:12] about 100 subscribers or so so I
[00:20:15] definitely recommend considering
[00:20:16] platforms like Twitter Youtube Youtube
[00:20:18] shorts medium or even your own open
[00:20:20] source project with a dedicated Discord
[00:20:22] server it will take some time to grow
[00:20:24] your audience but if you stick the
[00:20:26] investment will totally be worth it so
[00:20:28] yeah that's it for this video guys if
[00:20:30] you want to grab this whole road map and
[00:20:32] my AI agent scoping template for notion
[00:20:35] make sure to use the link below it's
[00:20:36] going to ask you for your email because
[00:20:38] I'm currently working on a complete
[00:20:40] course that will include a lot more
[00:20:42] information that I couldn't fit into a
[00:20:43] single video here we are actually one of
[00:20:45] the very few companies in the world that
[00:20:47] productized AI agent development at
[00:20:50] scale so we have a lot more to share
[00:20:52] however before we do that I want to make
[00:20:54] sure that this course is as good as it
[00:20:56] can be so it will probably take me a
[00:20:58] couple months or so to make it thank you
[00:21:00] guys for watching and don't forget to
[00:21:02] subscribe
