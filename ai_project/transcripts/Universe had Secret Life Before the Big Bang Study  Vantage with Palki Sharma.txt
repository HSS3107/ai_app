Description: Universe had Secret Life Before the Big Bang: Study | Vantage with Palki Sharma

A new study says that the universe had a secret life before the Big Bang. According to the study, the Big Bang may not have been the beginning of the universe. Astronomers say the Big Bang birthed the universe with an explosion when, about 14 billion years ago, universe grew from a single point. But new research claims that the Big Bang was not a birthing point but a transition phase. Scientists argue that a different theory called the Big Crunch may have birthed the universe. Palki Sharma brings you the report.

Transcript:

[00:00:04] what was God doing before he created the
[00:00:07] world back in the 4th Century
[00:00:09] philosopher Augustine of Hippo asked
[00:00:11] this question and then he answered it
[00:00:13] himself he said before God created the
[00:00:16] world there was no time there was no
[00:00:18] before the question is
[00:00:21] invalid when it comes to the universe
[00:00:24] you could repeat the same annoying
[00:00:25] process and ask what came before the Big
[00:00:29] Bang and most astronomers would say
[00:00:31] nothing time space matter they all began
[00:00:35] with a sudden explosion what we call the
[00:00:37] big bang but a new study is challenging
[00:00:40] this Theory it says there was a secret
[00:00:42] life before the bang our next report
[00:00:45] tells you
[00:00:46] more the big
[00:00:48] yarn the big scam or the big sham ignore
[00:00:54] us we're coming up with alternate lingo
[00:00:56] for the theory that has so far told us
[00:00:58] how the universe began
[00:01:00] we're talking about the Big Bang
[00:01:03] Theory that's what astronomers say
[00:01:05] birthed the universe they say it all
[00:01:08] started with a single point about 14
[00:01:10] billion years ago the universe was
[00:01:12] trapped inside a bubble just hot tiny
[00:01:15] particles mixed with light and energy
[00:01:18] all of this thousands of times smaller
[00:01:20] than a pin head it was super cramped so
[00:01:23] the bubble was dense and hot doesn't
[00:01:26] sound very healthy so like most people
[00:01:29] in toxic relationships the universe was
[00:01:32] in desperate need for space within a
[00:01:35] fraction of a second it suddenly
[00:01:38] exploded this is called the Big Bang and
[00:01:41] the universe we know today was born and
[00:01:44] it began growing stretching in all
[00:01:47] directions tiny particles came together
[00:01:49] to form atoms then more atoms came
[00:01:52] together and we got stars planets
[00:01:55] asteroids galaxies and even black holes
[00:01:58] the universe grew at a rapid rate and it
[00:02:01] never stopped billions of years later
[00:02:04] it's still expanding that's quite the
[00:02:07] growth spurt but what if none of this is
[00:02:09] true after all the big bang is just a
[00:02:12] theory there's no proof so what if the
[00:02:16] Big Bang was not the birth of the
[00:02:18] universe what if there was life before
[00:02:20] the Big Bang this is what a new study
[00:02:23] says that our universe may have had a
[00:02:26] secret life before the Big Bang
[00:02:28] according to the study black black holes
[00:02:30] already existed they contracted to form
[00:02:33] the little bubble that eventually
[00:02:34] exploded so technically atoms existed
[00:02:37] even before the Big Bang but it's not
[00:02:40] alone in coming up with the theory in
[00:02:43] modern astronomy many scientists have
[00:02:45] said something similar they say the Big
[00:02:48] Bang was not a birth but a transition
[00:02:50] phase they call this Theory the Big
[00:02:53] Crunch let's explain have you heard of a
[00:02:56] sule normally it's cool and small
[00:03:00] but if you heat it up as you should it
[00:03:02] expands eventually the sule cools and
[00:03:06] then it collapses now imagine that the
[00:03:08] sule is our universe the Big Crunch says
[00:03:12] something similar happens to our
[00:03:13] universe it's expanding now but thanks
[00:03:16] to gravity one day everything will begin
[00:03:19] to contract it will fall inwards and
[00:03:22] collapse much like a fallen sule now no
[00:03:26] one is going to like a collapsing
[00:03:27] Universe this will spell the Doom of of
[00:03:30] everything every Galaxy every planet
[00:03:33] every ex-boyfriend's t-shirt you still
[00:03:35] cherish every comic you hold dear all of
[00:03:38] it gone and the universe will turn into
[00:03:42] a super hot super dense bubble awaiting
[00:03:45] its next big bang so these are the two
[00:03:48] camps the big bang and the Big Crunch
[00:03:51] this is kind of like Team Edward versus
[00:03:53] Team Jacob if you know what we mean but
[00:03:55] scientists have picked their favorite
[00:03:57] Theory so far no one has any proof but
[00:04:01] for ordinary Souls like us do you know
[00:04:03] the best part it will be billions of
[00:04:06] years before the sule will collapse if
