In this video, I learned that elite speakers have a distinct verbal brand, which is essentially a unique way of expressing themselves that reflects their values and goals. This is how you become articulate with speaking. I discovered that building my own verbal brand involves choosing words and phrases that align with how I want to be perceived, avoiding overused or awkward expressions. I also need to address "lexical gaps"—the moments when I'm unsure of the right words—by learning new, clear ways to express complex ideas. Practicing these phrases aloud and embedding them into my subconscious will help me communicate more naturally and effectively like the elite 1%.

[00:00:00] every influential person has a verbal
[00:00:02] brand here is Steve Jobs verbal brand
[00:00:05] here is Muhammad Ali's and here is yours
[00:00:08] what is a verbal brand the boundaries
[00:00:11] set around the words and phrases someone
[00:00:13] will and will not use building your
[00:00:16] verbal brand is the first of three
[00:00:18] stages to help articulate yourself like
[00:00:20] 1% communicators I'll also give you some
[00:00:23] of my personal resources that have aided
[00:00:25] me so let's begin building your verbal
[00:00:27] brand 1% communicators of taken ordinary
[00:00:30] phrases and found a preferred personal
[00:00:33] way of saying them with creativity
[00:00:35] instead of saying getting super popular
[00:00:37] they might say on the ascendancy right
[00:00:39] now instead of saying a certain way of
[00:00:41] thinking they might say schools of
[00:00:43] thought Big Challenge might be described
[00:00:45] as a thorny problem unfortunately few
[00:00:48] people today pay any attention to their
[00:00:50] verbal brand we say anything and
[00:00:52] everything which is usually the same
[00:00:54] thing as everyone else usually some
[00:00:56] combination of these words we do have
[00:00:58] some unique words and phrases that we've
[00:01:00] picked up from friends and family but
[00:01:02] the constant use of stale Expressions
[00:01:04] lots of fillers and using vulgarity like
[00:01:07] a comma makes us all sound like a colony
[00:01:09] of Seagulls we need to make an agreement
[00:01:11] with ourselves about the type of words
[00:01:13] we want and don't want to use our choice
[00:01:15] of words should depend on the goals we
[00:01:17] are striving towards what goals well if
[00:01:20] we have ourselves a cup of Honest Tea
[00:01:22] most people want to speak well in order
[00:01:24] to impact wealth status or understanding
[00:01:27] once you know what you're after you can
[00:01:29] begin building a verbal brand around the
[00:01:31] set of events ahead of you ask yourself
[00:01:33] in what situations do I not have verbal
[00:01:36] confidence where I may be lacking the
[00:01:38] right words or phrases here's a list of
[00:01:40] the common scenarios start researching
[00:01:43] one of those environments find movie
[00:01:45] clips Reddit posts or articles what are
[00:01:48] the words and phrases most effective in
[00:01:51] those environments you're not going to
[00:01:52] remember them so write them down your
[00:01:54] goal is to make a list of the words and
[00:01:56] phrases that resonate with you and your
[00:01:59] comfortable using and avoid words that
[00:02:01] are stiff and showy no one knows what
[00:02:04] you mean by procuring a burger words
[00:02:07] like procure extrapolate or
[00:02:10] indefatigable may look articulate on
[00:02:12] paper but saying them will make you
[00:02:14] sound like a child trying to cuss for
[00:02:15] the first time you don't need fancy
[00:02:17] words to have a good verbal brand in
[00:02:19] fact the reason the 1% speak with such
[00:02:22] surgical Precision is not because
[00:02:24] they've swallowed the dictionary it's
[00:02:26] because they've removed verbal discords
[00:02:30] like a bad chord in a beautiful Melody
[00:02:32] verbal discords are words and phrases
[00:02:35] that just sound out of place Joe Rogan
[00:02:38] would never use flowery words like ulent
[00:02:41] or splendent Martin Luther King would
[00:02:43] never use juvenile language like dozy or
[00:02:46] flap doodle and Gandalf would certainly
[00:02:49] never say these robes be busting for me
[00:02:52] I used to hate using the word bucket
[00:02:54] let's bucket everything into one group
[00:02:56] it's like a bucket of different ideas to
[00:02:58] me it always sounded well well cheap and
[00:03:01] juvenile and that's the frustration with
[00:03:03] verbal discords is they don't align with
[00:03:05] how we want to sound but it's the only
[00:03:07] way we know how to say something bucket
[00:03:09] was the clumsy way I described many
[00:03:12] things grouped together using a method
[00:03:14] we'll reveal later in this video I found
[00:03:16] the alternative word assemble that word
[00:03:19] is now part of my verbal brand and every
[00:03:21] time my mouth is tempted to say bucket
[00:03:23] my mind remembers to use the replacement
[00:03:26] now that we've refined our verbal brand
[00:03:28] we can start solving lexical gaps your
[00:03:31] Lexicon are the words you know a lexical
[00:03:35] Gap is when it takes you 5 minutes to
[00:03:37] say something that can be said in 10
[00:03:39] seconds so it's like uh you know when
[00:03:40] you're talking to someone right and
[00:03:41] you're both there physically but you're
[00:03:44] also kind of not there you know like
[00:03:46] your mind is totally somewhere else but
[00:03:48] you're also talking without not really
[00:03:50] talking and it makes everything kind of
[00:03:52] feel sort of
[00:03:53] empty you mean not being present these
[00:03:57] lexical gaps make our speech muddle the
[00:04:00] path from the beginning of our thought
[00:04:01] to the endend is long and winding now
[00:04:04] this Gap exists for two reasons one the
[00:04:08] idea you're trying to communicate is
[00:04:10] unclear in your mind in which case you
[00:04:13] need to learn more I'm going to find
[00:04:14] lexical gaps in my speech pretty quickly
[00:04:16] if I start talking about something I
[00:04:18] know nothing about like neuroplasticity
[00:04:21] in gorilla brains number two your choice
[00:04:24] of words is vague vague words lead to
[00:04:27] speech that feels inarticulate most of
[00:04:30] society speaks this way can you
[00:04:32] communicate this way absolutely in fact
[00:04:35] it's ideal for casual conversation but
[00:04:38] let's be honest no one is remembering
[00:04:39] what you say and no amount of Han Zimmer
[00:04:42] soundtracks blaring behind your words
[00:04:44] will make them articulate see what we
[00:04:47] perceive as articulate is usually
[00:04:49] hearing something we expect to be said
[00:04:51] in drawn out and vague words said in
[00:04:54] simple and precise words why is that
[00:04:57] because that person speaking has spent
[00:05:00] time thinking it through intelligence is
[00:05:03] compression of information your favorite
[00:05:06] podcaster is your favorite podcaster
[00:05:08] because they have solved most lexical
[00:05:10] gaps related to the ideas in their
[00:05:12] domain of knowledge their explanations
[00:05:14] therefore are lean and concise listen to
[00:05:18] how clearly the American investor Nal
[00:05:20] ravot speaks the only true test of
[00:05:22] intelligence is if you get what you want
[00:05:24] out of life and that triggers a lot of
[00:05:26] people but how else do you know how else
[00:05:28] do you know if you're smart if you're
[00:05:29] not getting what you want lot out of
[00:05:31] life how smart are you really okay you
[00:05:33] might have had bad luck once upon a time
[00:05:34] but consistently every time I doubt it
[00:05:37] and there's two parts to that one is
[00:05:39] actually testing yourself against the
[00:05:40] world to see if you get what you want
[00:05:42] the other is wanting the right things in
[00:05:43] the first place this man breathes
[00:05:46] Clarity with every sentence if you want
[00:05:48] to speak clearly you need to First think
[00:05:51] clearly and thinking clearly Begins by
[00:05:54] logging the lexical gaps in your
[00:05:56] speaking there are apps that allow you
[00:05:58] to easily do this or you can can do this
[00:06:00] with any note-taking application here's
[00:06:02] what this looks like in my Apple notes
[00:06:04] write down just one phrase today that is
[00:06:06] long- winded most people will never do
[00:06:08] this because it's not fun digging up
[00:06:11] your verbal corpses but you're not going
[00:06:13] to find a better combination of words
[00:06:15] next time if you don't make the effort
[00:06:17] to bridge the lexical Gap now before I
[00:06:20] introduce the solution for solving
[00:06:22] lexical gaps if you're like me and you
[00:06:24] are in a season of articulacy I recently
[00:06:27] launched a two-e master class detailing
[00:06:29] my articulation Journey along with every
[00:06:31] resource exercise and framework that has
[00:06:34] helped me develop a natural articulacy
[00:06:38] better speak is designed to implement
[00:06:40] everything I discuss here on YouTube and
[00:06:42] give you the steps needed to acquire
[00:06:44] that lost art and superpower of good
[00:06:48] speaking check out the trailer below so
[00:06:50] to solve your lexical gaps the three
[00:06:52] solutions are one download this book and
[00:06:55] locate articulate alternatives for any
[00:06:57] immature or overused phrases in your
[00:07:00] speech such as my word bucket you can
[00:07:03] also use these chat GPT prompts I wrote
[00:07:05] that will take your lexical gaps and
[00:07:07] provide a more concise and clearer way
[00:07:10] of phrasing them three one incredibly
[00:07:13] easy way to solve for lexical gaps is to
[00:07:16] interact with speech where the lexical
[00:07:18] gaps are already solved where do we find
[00:07:20] these sentences in speeches this site
[00:07:23] here will allow you to find the
[00:07:24] transcript for any speech from a movie
[00:07:26] or historical event read the transcripts
[00:07:29] loud along with watching the video
[00:07:32] speeches are the green smoothies the
[00:07:35] wheat grass shots of language they are
[00:07:38] packed with such nutritious word
[00:07:40] combinations here's a list of the best
[00:07:42] speeches to begin with listen to these
[00:07:44] speeches for a few days and you'll
[00:07:46] immediately notice your mind will be
[00:07:48] better calibrated to start solving
[00:07:50] lexical gaps in advance this is the
[00:07:52] secret to speaking like the 1% in
[00:07:55] conversation learning to do some kind of
[00:07:57] word processing in advance
[00:08:00] this is also why many great speakers
[00:08:02] usually first were writers writing
[00:08:05] provides many opportunities to solve for
[00:08:07] lexical gaps hey Neil degrass Tyson how
[00:08:10] do you speak with Precision every time
[00:08:12] you open your mouth I've thought out
[00:08:14] those words before hardly any sentence
[00:08:17] in public comes out of my mouth unless
[00:08:20] I've written it down once before so
[00:08:22] we've tamed our verbal brand and we know
[00:08:24] how to find and fix lexical gaps however
[00:08:28] none of this matter is if we can't
[00:08:30] retrieve these changes in the moment
[00:08:33] great speakers know how to plant this
[00:08:35] information in their subconscious so
[00:08:37] that it influences their speech without
[00:08:39] much thought required because if we're
[00:08:42] excessively choosing every single word
[00:08:46] that comes out of our mouth we filter
[00:08:49] out our genuine self we need to speak
[00:08:52] freely and feel opportunities where
[00:08:55] clear and creative language can be used
[00:08:57] kind of like when you're listening to a
[00:08:58] playlist on Spotify and approaching the
[00:09:01] ending of a song and you can sense the
[00:09:03] beginning of the next song before it
[00:09:05] even starts why is that because the
[00:09:08] transition between those two songs has
[00:09:10] been reinforced many times language is
[00:09:13] much the same we need to reinforce
[00:09:15] hearing articulate language so that we
[00:09:17] develop a sense for when it can best be
[00:09:19] used this is done with lexical
[00:09:22] simulations where you practice using a
[00:09:25] word or phrase in a simulated scenario
[00:09:28] say you have a friend who believes that
[00:09:30] rocks are soft until touched and let's
[00:09:32] also say that you've recently added the
[00:09:34] phrase schools of thought to your verbal
[00:09:36] brand you'd like to use the phrase more
[00:09:38] often so you simulate talking to your
[00:09:41] friend about his questionable beliefs I
[00:09:44] think there are two schools of thought
[00:09:45] on this topic well I think rocks are
[00:09:48] soft I think you might want to
[00:09:50] reconsider that school of thought
[00:09:52] remember that it takes using a phrase or
[00:09:54] a word roughly 38 unique times in order
[00:09:57] to commit it to subconscious memory
[00:09:59] where you don't have to think about it
[00:10:01] to use it a word is five times more
[00:10:04] likely to be used when you say it aloud
[00:10:06] than if you read it or hear it you can
[00:10:09] glue yourself to Tik Tok and watch
[00:10:11] compilations of powerful quotes all day
[00:10:13] but that isn't going to do anything to
[00:10:15] influence your speech if you don't
[00:10:17] activate your speaking apparatus say
[00:10:19] great words aloud enough times and who
[00:10:23] knows you may receive an invite on to
[00:10:25] your favorite podcast
