Drifting into the President’s private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his secretaries, “That’s a\npretty dress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very attractive young woman.”\n\nThat was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever bestowed upon a secretary in his life. It\nwas so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, “Now, don’t get\nstuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you would be a little bit more careful with\nyour punctuation.”\n\nHis method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to listen to\nunpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.\n\nA barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what McKinley did back in 1896,\nwhen he was running for President. One of the prominent Republicans of that day had written a campaign\nspeech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster all rolled into one.\nWith great glee, this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley. The speech had its fine points, but it just\nwouldn’t do. It would have raised a tornado of criticism. McKinley didn’t want to hurt the man’s feelings. He\nmust not kill the man’s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say ‘no’. Note how adroitly he did it.\n\n“My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,” McKinley said. “No one could have\nprepared a better one. There are many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say, but is it\nquite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your standpoint, I must consider its\neffect from the party’s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech along the lines I indicate, and send me\na copy of it.”\n\nHe did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his second speech, and he became one\nof the effective speakers of the campaign.\n\nHere is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was\nwritten to Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln\nprobably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars,\nand that, by the way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard work. The\nletter was written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For\neighteen months, Lincoln’s generals had been leading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another.\nNothing but futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers had deserted from\nthe army, and then the Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the\nWhite House. “We are now on the brink of destruction,” Lincoln said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is\nagainst us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.” Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter came.\n\nI am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to change an obstreperous general\nwhen the very fate of the nation could have depended upon the general’s action.\n\nThis is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became President; yet you will note that\nhe praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave faults.\n\nYes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn’t call them that. Lincoln was more conservative, more\ndiplomatic. Lincoln wrote, “There are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.” Talk\nabout tact! And diplomacy!\n\nHere is the letter addressed to General Hooker:\n\nI have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac.\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for\nyou to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.\n\nI believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix\npolitics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not\nan indispensable quality.\n\nYou are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm, But I think that\nduring General Burnside’s command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as\nmuch as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable\nbrother officer.\n\nI have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the\nGovernment needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you command.\n\nOnly those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you is military\nsuccess and I will risk the dictatorship.\n\nThe Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has\ndone and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the army, of\ncriticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as\nfar as I can, to put it down.\n\nNeither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such spirit\nprevails in it, and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go\nforward and give us victories.\n\nYou are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know whether this philosophy will\noperate for you in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let’s see. Let’s take the case of W. P. Gaw of the Wark\nCompany, Philadelphia.\n\nThe Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large office building in Philadelphia by a\ncertain specified date. Everything was going along well; the building was almost finished, when suddenly the\nsub-contractor making the ornamental bronze work to go on the exterior of this building declared that he\ncouldn’t make delivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All\nbecause of one man!\n\nLong-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent\nto New York to beard the bronze lion in his den.\n\n“Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name?” Mr Gaw asked the president of\nthe subcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced. The president was surprised. “No, I didn’t know\nthat.”\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Gaw, “when I got off the train this morning, I looked in the telephone book to get\nyour address, and you’re the only person in the Brooklyn phone book with your name.”",

        "page_content": "## Preface To Revised Edition\n\nOpera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said, “My wife and I made a pact\na long time ago, and we’ve kept it no matter how angry we’ve grown with each other. When one yells, the other\nshould listen, because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it._**\n\n\n-----\n\n## 11\n\n###### “A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIES—AND HOW TO AVOID IT.”\n\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed that if he could be right 75 percent of\nthe time, he would reach the highest measure of his expectation.\n\nIf that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men of the twentieth century could\nhope to obtain, what about you and me?\n\nIf you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make\na million dollars a day. If you can’t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other\npeople they are wrong?\n\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can\nin words—and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have\nstruck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike\nback. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato\nor an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.\n\nNever begin by announcing “I am going to prove so-and-so to you.” That’s bad. That’s tantamount to\nsaying, “I’m smarter than you are, I’m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.”\n\nThat is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before you\neven start.\n\nIt is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change people’s minds. So why make it\nharder? Why handicap yourself?\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one\nwill feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you\ntaught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot.\n\nOver three hundred years ago Galileo said, “You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him\nto find it within himself.”\n\nAs Lord Chesterfield said to his son, “Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.”\n\nSocrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens, “One thing only I know, and that is that I know\nnothing.”\n\nWell, I can’t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling people they are wrong. And I\nfind that it pays.\n\nIf a person makes a statement that you think is wrong—yes, even that you know is wrong—isn’t it\nbetter to begin by saying, “Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I\nam wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\nThere’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as, “I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the\nfacts.”\n\nNobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to\nyour saying, “I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of our class members who used this approach in dealing with customers was Harold Reinke, a\nDodge dealer in Billings, Montana. He reported that because of the pressures of the automobile business, he was\noften hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers’ complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of\nbusiness and general unpleasantness.\n\nHe told his class, “Recognizing that this was getting me nowhere fast, I tried a new tack. I would say\nsomething like this, ‘Our dealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently ashamed. We may have\nerred in your case. Tell me about it.’\n\n“This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the customer releases his feelings, he is\nusually much more reasonable when it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers have thanked me\nfor having such an understanding attitude. And two of them have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In\nthis highly competitive market, we need more of this type of customer, and I believe that showing respect for all\ncustomers’ opinions and treating them diplomatically and courteously will help beat the competition.”\n\nYou will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and\ninspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit\nthat he, too, may be wrong.\n\nIf you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell him or her so, what happens? Let me\nillustrate. Mr. S---- a young New York attorney, once argued a rather important case before the United States\nSupreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280 U.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of money\nand an important question of law. During the argument, one of the Supreme Court justices said to him, “The\nstatute of limitations in admiralty law is six years, is it not?”\n\nMr. S---- stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment, and then said bluntly, “Your Honor, there is no\nstatute of limitations in admiralty.”\n\n“A hush fell on the court,” said Mr. S---- as he related his experience to one of the author’s classes,\n“and the temperature in the room seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice—was wrong. And I had told him\nso. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke\nbetter than I ever spoke before. But I didn’t persuade. I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and\nfamous man that he was wrong.”\n\nFew people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with\npreconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don’t want to change\ntheir minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star. So, if you are\ninclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast. It is\nfrom James Harvey Robinson’s enlightening book The Mind in the Making.\n\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we\nare told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the\nformation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob\nus of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which\nis threatened…The little word ‘my’ is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is\nthe beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is ‘my’ dinner, ‘my’ dog, and ‘my’ house, or ‘my’\nfather, ‘my’ country, and ‘my’ God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car\nshabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of “Epictetus”, of the medicinal\nvalue of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have\nbeen accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions\nleads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning\nconsists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.\n\nCarl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On Becoming a Person:",

Of course, you might have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or because a\ncustomer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution because you wanted something.\n\nHarry A. Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human Behavior said, “Action springs out of\nwhat we fundamentally desire, and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether\nin business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who\ncan do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”\n\nAndrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally\ngave away $365 million, learned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the\nother person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he learned how to handle people.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys. They were at Yale, and they were\nso busy with their own affairs that they neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their mother’s\nfrantic letters.\n\nThen Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an answer by return mail, without\neven asking for it. Someone called his bet, so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a\npost-script that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.\n\nHe neglected, however, to enclose the money.\n\nBack came replies by return mail thanking “Dear Uncle Andrew” for his kind note and…you can finish\nthe sentence yourself.\n\nAnother example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our\ncourse. Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the\nliving room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s\nnormal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind\nto go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the\nbest frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to\nkindergarten?” He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing\nsongs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started finger-painting on the kitchen\ntable—my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner.\nNext he was begging to participate. ‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’\nWith all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand, telling him\nall the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs\nand found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to\ngo to kindergarten. I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager\nwant that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.”\n\nTomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask\nyourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?”\n\nThat question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.\n\nAt one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in\norder to hold a series of lectures.\n\nAt the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times\nas much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all\nannouncements had been made.\n\nNaturally, I didn’t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I\nwanted? They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager.\n\n“I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,” I said, “but I don’t blame you at all. If I had been in your\nposition, I should probably have written a similar letter myself. Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make\nall the profit possible. If you don’t do that, you will be fired and you ought to be fired. Now, let’s take a piece of\npaper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase\nin rent.”\n\nThen I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and headed one column ‘Advantages’ and the\nother column ‘Disadvantages’.\n\nI wrote down under the head ‘Advantages’ these words: “Ballroom free”. Then I went on to say, “You\nwill have the advantage of having the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage,\nfor affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for\ntwenty nights during the course of the season, it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you.\n\n\n-----\n\n“Now, let’s consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing your income from me, you are\ngoing to decrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be\nforced to hold these lectures at some other place.\n\n“There’s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract crowds of educated and cultured\npeople to your hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn’t it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars\nadvertising in the newspapers, you couldn’t bring as many people to look at your hotel as I can bring by these\nlectures. That is worth a lot to a hotel, isn’t it?”\n\nAs I talked, I wrote these two ‘disadvantages’ under the proper heading, and handed the sheet of paper\nto the manager, saying, “I wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages that are\ngoing to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.”\n\nI received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be increased only 50 percent instead\nof 300 percent.\n\nMind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time about\nwhat the other person wanted and how he could get it.\n\nSuppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had stormed into his office and said, “What do\nyou mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been printed and the\nannouncements made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous! Absurd! I won’t pay it!”\n\nWhat would have happened then? An argument would have begun to steam and boil and sputter, and\nyou know how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have made it\ndifficult for him to back down and give in.\n\nHere is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships. “If there is\nany one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see\nthings from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”\n\nThat is so good, I want to repeat it: \"If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the\n_other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”_\n\nThat is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of it at a glance; yet 90 percent of the\npeople on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.\n\nAn example? Look at the letters that come across your desk tomorrow morning, and you will find that\nmost of them violate this important canon of common sense. Take this one, a letter written by the head of the\nradio department of an advertising agency with offices scattered across the continent. This letter was sent to the\nmanagers of local radio stations throughout the country (I have set down, in brackets, my reactions to each\nparagraph).",

He told how he had worked in an office all day, and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief\nnaps while the chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two hours at\na stretch.\n\nJames Adamson had been ushered into Eastman’s office at ten-fifteen and had been warned that he\nmust not take more than five minutes; but an hour had passed, then two hours passed. And they were still\ntalking. Finally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said, “The last time I was in Japan I bought some\nchairs, brought them home, and put them in my sun porch. But the sun peeled the paint, so I went downtown the\nother day and bought some paint and painted the chairs myself. Would you like to see what sort of a job I can do\npainting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have lunch with me and I’ll show you.”\n\nAfter lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had brought from Japan. They weren’t worth\nmore than a few dollars, but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them because he himself\nhad painted them.\n\nThe order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do you suppose got the order—James Adamson or\none of his competitors?\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the time of this story until Mr. Eastman’s death, he and James Adamson were close friends.\n\nClaude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France, used this principle and saved his restaurant the\nloss of a key employee. This woman had been in his employ for five years and was a vital link between M.\nMarais and his staff of twenty-one people. He was shocked to receive a registered letter from her advising him\nof her resignation.\n\nM. Marais reported, “I was very surprised and, even more, disappointed, because I was under the\nimpression that I had been fair to her and receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend as well as an\nemployee, I probably had taken her too much for granted and maybe was even more demanding of her than of\nother employees.\n\n“I could not, of course, accept this resignation without some explanation. I took her aside and said,\n‘Paulette, you must understand that I cannot accept your resignation. You mean a great deal to me and to this\ncompany, and you are as important to the success of this restaurant as I am.’ I repeated this in front of the entire\nstaff, and I invited her to my home and reiterated my confidence in her with my family present.\n\n“Paulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as never before. I frequently reinforce\nthis by expressing my appreciation for what she does and showing her how important she is to me and to the\nrestaurant.”\n\n“Talk to people about themselves,” said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British\nEmpire. “Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 6**\n**_Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_Become genuinely interested in other people._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n\n**_Smile._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**_Be a good listener.

I was\nmanager at the time for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace out in Palestine;\nand shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the world by flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such\nfeat had ever been attempted before. It created a tremendous sensation. The Australian government awarded him\nfifty thousand dollars; the King of England knighted him; and, for a while, he was the most talked-about man\nunder the Union Jack. I was attending a banquet one night given in Sir Ross’s honor; and during the dinner, the\nman sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation “There’s a divinity that shapes our\nends, rough-hew them how we will.”\n\nThe raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He was wrong. I knew that, I knew it\npositively. There couldn’t be the slightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and display my\nsuperiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee of one to correct him. He stuck to\nhis guns. What? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it.\n\nThe storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank Gammond, an old friend of mine, was seated at my\nleft. Mr. Gammond had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare, So the storyteller and I agreed to submit the\nquestion to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked me under the table, and then said: “Dale, you are\nwrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.”\n\nOn our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond, “Frank, you knew that quotation was from\nShakespeare,”\n\n“Yes, of course,” he replied, “Hamlet, Act Five, Scene Two. But we were guests at a festive occasion,\nmy dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his\nface? He didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle.”\nThe man who said that taught me a lesson I’ll never forget. I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable,\nbut had put my friend in an embarrassing situation. How much better it would have been had I not become\nargumentative.\n\nIt was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued\nwith my brother about everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied logic and\nargumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk about being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be\nshown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to\nwrite a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of\narguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to\nget the best of an argument—and that is to avoid it.\n\nAvoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.\n\nNine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever\nthat he is absolutely right.\n\nYou can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it.\nWhy? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is\n_non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You_\nhave hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And…\n\n_A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still._\n\nYears ago Patrick J. O’Haire joined one of my classes. He had had little education, and how he loved a\nscrap! He had once been a chauffeur, and he came to me because he had been trying, without much success, to\nsell trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he was continually scrapping with and antagonizing the\n\n\n-----",

House practically told Bryan that he was too important for the job—and Bryan\nwas satisfied.\n\nColonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the world, was following one of the important rules\nof human relations: Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.\n\nWoodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting William Gibbs McAdoo to become a\nmember of his cabinet. That was the highest honor he could confer upon anyone, and yet Wilson extended the\ninvitation in such a way as to make McAdoo feel doubly important. Here is the story in McAdoo's own words:\n“He [Wilson] said that he was making up his cabinet and that he would be very glad if I would accept a place in\nit as Secretary of the Treasury. He had a delightful way of putting things; he created the impression that by\naccepting this great honor I would be doing him a favor.”\n\nUnfortunately, Wilson didn’t always employ such taut. If he had, history might have been different. For\nexample, Wilson didn’t make the Senate and the Republican Party happy by entering the United States in the\nLeague of Nations. Wilson refused to take such prominent Republican leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans\nHughes or Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with him. Instead, he took along unknown men from his\nown party. He snubbed the Republicans, refused to let them feel that the League was their idea as well as his,\nrefused to let them have a finger in the pie; and, as a result of this crude handling of human relations, wrecked\nhis own career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused America to stay out of the League, and altered the\nhistory of the world.\n\nStatesmen and diplomats aren’t the only ones who use this make-a-person-happy-yo-do-things-youwant-them-to-do approach. Dale O. Ferrier of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told how he encouraged one of his young\nchildren to willingly do the chore he was assigned.\n\n“One of Jeff’s chores was to pick up pears from under the pear tree so the person who was mowing\nunderneath wouldn’t have to stop to pick them up. He didn’t like this chore, and frequently it was either not\ndone at all or it was done so poorly that the mower had to stop and pick up several pears that he had missed.\nRather than have an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it, one day I said to him, ‘Jeff, I’ll make a deal with\nyou. For every bushel basket full of pears you pick up, I’ll pay you one dollar. But after you are finished, for\nevery pear I find left in the yard, I’ll take away a dollar. How does that sound?’ As you would expect, he not\nonly picked up all of the pears, but I had to keep an eye on him to see that he didn’t pull a few off the trees to fill\nup some of the baskets.”\n\n\n-----\n\nI knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations extended by friends, invitations\ncoming from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least\ncontented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and toothis and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it,\nhe suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about\nthe refusal, He immediately changed the other person’s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the\ninvitation.\n\nGunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an employee in the food store he\nmanaged who was negligent about putting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were displayed.\nThis caused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders, admonitions, confrontations, with her about this\ndid not do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his office and told her he was appointing her\nSupervisor of Price Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the shelves\nproperly tagged. This new responsibility and title changed her attitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties\nsatisfactorily from then on.\n\nChildish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he created the Legion of Honor and\ndistributed 15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made eighteen of his generals “Marshals of France” and called his\ntroops the “Grand Army.” Napoleon was criticized for giving “toys” to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon\nreplied, “Men are ruled by toys.”\n\nThis technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and it will work for you. For\nexample, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running across and\ndestroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither worked. Then she tried giving the worst\nsinner in the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him her “detective” and put him in charge of\nkeeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her problem. Her “detective” built a bonfire in the backyard,\nheated an iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the lawn.\n\nThe effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change\nattitudes or behavior:\n\n1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and\nconcentrate on the benefits to the other person.\n\n2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.\n\n3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.\n\n4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.\n\n5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.\n\n_6._ When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he\npersonally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: “John, we have customers coming in tomorrow\nand I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish\nthe counter.” Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the\ntask: “John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it\n_later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the_\nstockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and\npolish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good\n_company image.”_\n\nWill John be happy about doing what you suggest? Probably not very happy, but happier than if you\nhad not pointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is\ninterested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been\npointed out to John that the job would have to be done eventually and by doing it now, he won’t be faced with it\nlater.\n\nIt is naive to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these\napproaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this way than\n\n\n-----\n\nby not using these principles—and if you increase your successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become\n10 percent more effective as a leader than you were before—and that is your benefit.\n\nPeople are more likely to do what you would like them to do when you use…\n\n**PRINCIPLE 9**\n**_Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**BE A LEADER**\n\n**A leader’s job often includes changing your people’s attitudes and behavior.

        "page_content": "## Preface To Revised Edition\n\n_How to Win Friends and Influence People was first published in 1937 in an edition of only five_\nthousand copies. Neither Dale Carnegie nor the publishers, Simon and Schuster, anticipated more than this\nmodest sale. To their amazement, the book became an overnight sensation, and edition after edition rolled off\nthe presses to keep up with the increasing public demand. How to Win Friends and Influence People took its\nplace in publishing history as one of the all-time international bestsellers. It touched a nerve and filled a human\nneed that was more than a faddish phenomenon of post-Depression days, as evidenced by its continued and\nuninterrupted sales into the eighties, almost half a century later.\n\nDale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a million dollars than to put a phrase into the\nEnglish language. How to Win Friends and Influence People became such a phrase, quoted, paraphrased,\nparodied, used in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to novels. The book itself was translated into\nalmost every known written language. Each generation has discovered it anew and has found it relevant.\n\nWhich brings us to the logical question: Why revise a book that has proven and continues to prove its\nvigorous and universal appeal? Why tamper with success?\n\nTo answer that, we must realize that Dale Carnegie himself was a tireless reviser of his own work\nduring his lifetime. How to Win Friends and Influence People was written to be used as a textbook for his\ncourses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations and is still used in those courses today. Until his death in\n1955 he constantly improved and revised the course itself to make it applicable to the evolving needs of an evergrowing public. No one was more sensitive to the changing currents of present-day life than Dale Carnegie. He\nconstantly improved and refined his methods of teaching; he updated his book on Effective Speaking several\ntimes. Had he lived longer, he himself would have revised How to Win Friends and Influence People to better\nreflect the changes that have taken place in the world since the thirties.\n\nMany of the names of prominent people in the book, well known at the time of first publication, are no\nlonger recognized by many of today’s readers. Certain examples and phrases seem as quaint and dated in our\nsocial climate as those in a Victorian novel. The important message and overall impact of the book is weakened\nto that extent.\n\nOur purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify and strengthen the book for a modern reader\nwithout tampering with the content. We have not “changed” How _to Win Friends and Influence People except to_\nmake a few excisions and add a few more contemporary examples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact—\neven the thirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote as he spoke, in an intensively exuberant, colloquial,\nconversational manner.\n\nSo his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the book and in his work. Thousands of people all over\nthe world are being trained in Carnegie courses in increasing numbers each year. And other thousands are\nreading and studying How to Win Friends and lnfluence People and being inspired to use its principles to better\ntheir lives. To all of them, we offer this revision in the spirit of the honing and polishing of a finely made tool.\n\n– Dorothy Carnegie\n(Mrs. Dale Carnegie)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How This Book Was Written—And Why\n\nDuring the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the publishing houses of America printed\nmore than a fifth of a million different books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many were financial failures.\n“Many,” did I say? The president of one of the largest publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his\ncompany, after seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost money on seven out of every eight books it\npublished.\n\nWhy, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after I had written it, why should you\nbother to read it?\n\nFair questions, both; and I’ll try to answer them.\n\nI have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for business and professional men and women\nin New York. At first, I conducted courses in public speaking only—courses designed to train adults, by actual\nexperience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise,\nboth in business interviews and before groups.\n\nBut gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective\nspeaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and\nsocial contacts.\n\nI also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of such training myself. As I look back across the\nyears, I am appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a book such as this had\nbeen placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a priceless boon it would have been.\n\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face, especially if you are in business. Yes,\nand that is also true if you are a housewife, architect or engineer. Research done a few years ago under the\nauspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching uncovered a most important and\nsignificant fact—a fact later confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute of Technology.\nThese investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one’s\nfinancial success is due to one’s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering,\nto personality and the ability to lead people.\n\nFor many years, I conducted courses each season at the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia, and also\ncourses for the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of probably more\nthan fifteen hundred engineers have passed through my classes. They came to me because they had finally\nrealized, after years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently\nnot those who know the most about engineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in\nengineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has\ntechnical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among\npeople—that person is headed for higher earning power.\n\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that “the ability to deal with people is as\npurchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay more for that ability,” said John D., “than for any\nother under the sun.”\n\nWouldn’t you suppose that every college in the land would conduct courses to develop the highestpriced ability under the sun? But if there is just one practical, commonsense course of that kind given for adults\nin even one college in the land, it has escaped my attention up to the present writing.\n\nThe University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted a survey to determine what\nadults want to study.\n\nThat survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the survey was made in Meriden,\nConnecticut. It had been chosen as a typical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and\nrequested to answer 156 questions—questions such as “What is your business or profession? Your education?\nHow do you spend your spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions? Your problems?\nWhat subjects are you most interested in studying?” And so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime\n\n\n-----\n\ninterest of adults and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to\nmake people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.",

        "page_content": "## Preface To Revised Edition\n\nNo one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old to react to the viewpoint of a\nfather thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father had expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that.\nSo he said to himself, “What does that boy want? How can I tie up what I want to what he wants?”\n\nIt was easy for the father when he starting thinking about it. His boy had a tricycle that he loved to ride\nup and down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn. A few doors down the street lived a bully—a\nbigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it himself.\n\n\n-----\n\nNaturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she would have to come out and take\nthe bully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again. This happened almost every day.\n\nWhat did the little boy want? It didn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to answer that one. His pride, his anger,\nhis desire for a feeling of importance—all the strongest emotions in his makeup—goaded him to get revenge, to\nsmash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights\nout of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat—when his father\npromised him that—there was no longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach,\nsauerkraut, salt mackerel—anything in order to be big enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so\noften.\n\nAfter solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little boy had the unholy habit of wetting\nhis bed.\n\nHe slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother would wake up and feel the sheet and\nsay, “Look, Johnny, what you did again last night.”\n\nHe would say, “No, I didn’t do it. You did it.”\n\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t want him to do it—none of these\nthings kept the bed dry. So the parents asked, “How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”\n\nWhat were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like\nGrandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a\npair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object.\n\nHis mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said, “Here is a\nlittle gentleman who would like to do some shopping.”\n\nThe salesgirl made him feel important by saying, “Young man, what can I show you?”\n\nHe stood a couple of inches taller and said, “I want to buy a bed for myself.”\n\nWhen he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was\npersuaded to buy it.\n\nThe bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to the\ndoor shouting, “Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!”\n\nThe father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab’s injunction: he was “hearty in his approbation\nand lavish in his praise.”\n\n“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father said. “Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this\nbed.” The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it.\nAnd he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.\n\nAnother father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn’t get his threeyear-old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility.\nSo the parents asked themselves, “How can we make her want to do it?”\n\nThe little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a\nchair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen\nwhile she was stirring the cereal and she said, “Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.”\n\nShe ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She had\nachieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.\n\nWilliam Winter once remarked that “self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why\ncan’t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making\n\n\n-----\n\nothers think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves.

You knew by some divine instinct\nthat you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in\ntwo years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that. You can make more friends in two\nmonths by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested\nin you.\n\nYet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into\nbecoming interested in them.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are\ninterested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.\n\nThe New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out\nwhich word is the most frequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun “I.” “I.” “I.” It was used\n3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. “I.” “I.” “I.” “I.” When you see a group photograph that you are in,\nwhose picture do you look for first?\n\nIf we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true,\nsincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.\n\nNapoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said, “Josephine, I have been as fortunate\nas any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can\nrely.” And historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.",

        "page_content": "## A Shortcut To Distinction\n\nby Lowell Thomas\n\n_This biographical information about Dale Carnegie was written as an introduction to the original edition of_\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People. It is reprinted in this edition to give the readers additional\n_background on Dale Carnegie._\n\nIt was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather couldn’t keep them away. Two thousand five\nhundred men and women thronged into the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every\navailable seat was filled by half-past seven. At eight o’clock, the eager crowd was still pouring in. The spacious\nbalcony was soon jammed. Presently even standing space was at a premium, and hundreds of people, tired after\nnavigating a day in business, stood up for an hour and a half that night to witness—what?\n\nA fashion show?\n\nA six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by Clark Gable?\n\nNo. These people had been lured there by a newspaper ad. Two evenings previously, they had seen this\nfull-page announcement in the New York _Sun staring them in the face:_\n\nLearn to Speak Effectively Prepare for Leadership\n\nOld stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated town on earth, during a depression with\n20 percent of the population on relief, twenty-five hundred people had left their homes and hustled to the hotel\nin response to that ad.\n\nThe people who responded were of the upper economic strata—executives, employers and\nprofessionals.\n\nThese men and women had come to hear the opening gun of an ultramodern, ultrapractical course in\n“Effective Speaking and Influencing Men in Business”—a course given by the Dale Carnegie Institute of\nEffective Speaking and Human Relations.\n\nWhy were they there, these twenty-five hundred business men and women?\n\nBecause of a sudden hunger for more education because of the depression?\n\nApparently not, for this same course had been playing to packed houses in New York City every season\nfor the preceding twenty-four years. During that time, more than fifteen thousand business and professional\npeople had been trained by Dale Carnegie. Even large, skeptical, conservative organizations such as the\nWestinghouse Electric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company,\nthe Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the New York\nTelephone Company have had this training conducted in their own offices for the benefit of their members and\nexecutives.\n\nThe fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade school, high school or college, come\nand take this training is a glaring commentary on the shocking deficiencies of our educational system.\n\nWhat do adults really want to study? That is an important question; and in order to answer it, the\nUniversity of Chicago, the American Association for Adult Education, and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools made\na survey over a two-year period.\n\nThat survey revealed that the prime interest of adults is health. It also revealed that their second interest\nis in developing skill in human relationships—they want to learn the technique of getting along with and\ninfluencing other people. They don’t want to become public speakers, and they don’t want to listen to a lot of\nhigh-sounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions they can use immediately in business, in social\ncontacts and in the home.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo that was what adults wanted to study, was it?\n\n“All right,” said the people making the survey. “Fine. If that is what they want, we’ll give it to them.”\n\nLooking around for a textbook, they discovered that no working manual had ever been written to help\npeople solve their daily problems in human relationships.\n\nHere was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years, learned volumes had been written on Greek and\nLatin and higher mathematics—topics about which the average adult doesn’t give two hoots. But on the one\nsubject on which he has a thirst for knowledge, a veritable passion for guidance and help—nothing!\n\nThis explained the presence of twenty-five hundred eager adults crowding into the grand ballroom of\nthe Hotel Pennsylvania in response to a newspaper advertisement. Here, apparently, at last was the thing for\nwhich they had long been seeking.\n\nBack in high school and college, they had pored over books, believing that knowledge alone was the\nopen sesame to financial—and professional rewards.\n\nBut a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business and professional life had brought sharp\ndisillusionment. They had seen some of the most important business successes won by men who possessed, in\naddition to their knowledge, the ability to talk well, to win people to their way of thinking, and to \"sell\"\nthemselves and their ideas.\n\nThey soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the captain’s cap and navigate the ship of business,\npersonality and the ability to talk are more important than a knowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin from\nHarvard.\n\nThe advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting would be highly entertaining. It was.\nEighteen people who had taken the course were marshaled in front of the loudspeaker—and fifteen of them were\ngiven precisely seventy-five seconds each to tell his or her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then “bang”\nwent the gavel, and the chairman shouted, “Time! Next speaker!”\n\nThe affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo thundering across the plains. Spectators stood for\nan hour and a half to watch the performance.\n\nThe speakers were a cross section of life: several sales representatives, a chain store executive, a baker,\nthe president of a trade association, two bankers, an insurance agent, an accountant, a dentist, an architect, a\ndruggist who had come from Indianapolis to New York to take the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana\nin order to prepare himself to give one important three-minute speech.\n\nThe first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J. O'Haire. Born in Ireland, he attended school for only\nfour years, drifted to America, worked as a mechanic, then as a chauffeur.\n\nNow, however, he was forty, he had a growing family and needed more money, so he tried selling\ntrucks. Suffering from an inferiority complex that, as he put it, was eating his heart out, he had to walk up and\ndown in front of an office half a dozen times before he could summon up enough courage to open the door. He\nwas so discouraged as a salesman that he was thinking of going back to working with his hands in a machine\nshop, when one day he received a letter inviting him to an organization meeting of the Dale Carnegie Course in\nEffective Speaking.\n\nHe didn’t want to attend. He feared he would have to associate with a lot of college graduates, that he\nwould be out of place.\n\nHis despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, “It may do you some good, Pat. God knows you need\nit.” He went down to the place where the meeting was to be held and stood on the sidewalk for five minutes\nbefore he could generate enough self-confidence to enter the room.\n\nThe first few times he tried to speak in front of the others, he was dizzy with fear. But as the weeks\ndrifted by, he lost all fear of audiences and soon found that he loved to talk—the bigger the crowd, the better.\nAnd he also lost his fear of individuals and of his superiors. He presented his ideas to them, and soon he had\n\n\n-----\n\nbeen advanced into the sales department. He had become a valued and much liked member of his company. This\nnight, in the Hotel Pennsylvania, Patrick O'Haire stood in front of twenty-five hundred people and told a gay,\nrollicking story of his achievements. Wave after wave of laughter swept over the audience. Few professional\nspeakers could have equaled his performance.\n\nThe next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray-headed banker, the father of eleven children. The first\ntime he had attempted to speak in class, he was literally struck dumb. His mind refused to function. His story is\na vivid illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person who can talk.",

        "page_content": "## Preface To Revised Edition\n\nAdolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile showroom and a student in one of my\ncourses, suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a discouraged and\ndisorganized group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly\nwhat they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the blackboard. He then said, “I’ll give\nyou all these qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to tell me what I have a right to expect from you.”\nThe replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of\nenthusiastic work. The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration—one salesperson volunteered to\nwork fourteen hours a day—and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.\n\n“The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me,” said Mr. Seltz, “and as long as I lived up to\nmy part in it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes and desires was just\nthe shot in the arm they needed.”\n\nNo one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel\nthat we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our\nwants, our thoughts.\n\nTake the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of dollars in commissions before he\nlearned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile\nmanufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in New York once a week, every week for\nthree years. “He never refused to see me,” said Mr. Wesson, “but he never bought. He always looked over my\nsketches very carefully and then said, ‘No, Wesson, I guess we don’t get any today.’”\n\nAfter 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so he resolved to devote one evening a\nweek to the study of influencing human behavior, to help him develop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.\n\nHe decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished artists’ sketches under his arm, he\nrushed over to the buyer’s office. “I want you to do me a little favor, if you will,” he said. “Here are some\nuncompleted sketches. Won’t you please tell me how we could finish them up in such a way that you could use\nthem?”\n\nThe buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word. Finally he said, “Leave these with\nme for a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see me.”\n\nWesson returned three days later, got his suggestions, took the sketches back to the studio and had\nthem finished according to the buyer’s ideas. The result? All accepted.\n\nAfter that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson, all drawn according to the buyer’s\nideas. “I realized why I had failed for years to sell him,” said Mr. Wesson. “I had urged him to buy what I\nthought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach completely. I urged him to give me his ideas. This made\nhim feel that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn’t have to sell him. He bought.”\n\nLetting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and politics, it works\nin family life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this principle:\n\n“My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing vacation trips we have ever taken. I\nhad long dreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall in\n\n\n-----\n\nPhiladelphia, and our nation’s capital. Valley Forge, Jamestown and the restored colonial village of\nWilliamsburg were high on the list of things I wanted to see.\n\n“In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our summer vacation which included a\ntour of the western states, visiting points of interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had\nwanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn’t obviously make both trips.\n\n“Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U.S. history in junior high school and had become\nvery interested in the events that had shaped our country’s growth. I asked her how she would like to visit the\nplaces she had learned about on our next vacation. She said she would love to.\n\n“Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy announced that if we all agreed, the\nsummer’s vacation would be to the eastern states, that it would he a great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of us.\nWe all concurred.”\n\nThis same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his equipment to one of the largest\nhospitals in Brooklyn This hospital was building an addition and preparing to equip it with the finest X-ray\ndepartment in America. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray department, was overwhelmed with sales\nrepresentatives, each caroling the praises of his own company’s equipment.\n\nOne manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more about handling human nature than\nthe others did. He wrote a letter something like this:\n\n“Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment. The first shipment of these\nmachines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So\nwe should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how\nthey can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send\nmy car for you at any hour you specify.\n\n“I was surprised to get that letter,” Dr. L ---- said as he related the incident before the class. “I was both\nsurprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel\nimportant. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the\nequipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I liked it.\n\n“Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that equipment for the hospital was my\nown. I sold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.”\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance” stated, “In every work of genius we recognize our\nown rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”\n\nColonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in national and international affairs while\nWoodrow Wilson occupied the White House. Wilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice\nmore than he did upon even members of his own cabinet.\n\nWhat method did the Colonel use in influencing the President? Fortunately, we know, for House\nhimself revealed it to Arthur D. Howden Smith, and Smith quoted House in an article in The Saturday Evening\n_Post:_\n\n“‘After I got to know the President,’ House said, ‘I learned the best way to convert him to an idea was\nto plant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in it—so as to get him thinking about it on his own\naccount. The first time this worked it was an accident. I had been visiting him at the White House and urged a\npolicy on him which he appeared to disapprove. But several days later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear\nhim trot out my suggestion as his own.’”\n\nDid House interrupt him and say, “That’s not your idea. That’s mine”? Oh, no. Not House. He was too\nadroit for that. He didn’t care about credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea was\nhis. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson public credit for these ideas.\n\nLet’s remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So let’s\nuse Colonel House’s technique.\n\n\n-----",

        "page_content": "## Preface To Revised Edition\n\nI have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand the other person. The way in\nwhich I have worded this statement may seem strange to you. Is it necessary to permit oneself to understand\nanother? I think it is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we hear from other people) is an\nevaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of it. When someone expresses some feeling, attitude or\nbelief, our tendency is almost immediately to feel “that’s right,” or “that’s stupid,” “that’s abnormal,” “that’s\n\n\n-----\n\nunreasonable,” “that’s incorrect,” “that’s not nice.” Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely\nwhat the meaning of the statement is to the other person.*\n\n- Adapted from Carl R. Rogers, On Becoming a Person (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1961), pp. 18ff.\n\nI once employed an interior decorator to make some draperies for my home. When the bill arrived, I\nwas dismayed.\n\nA few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the draperies. The price was mentioned, and she\nexclaimed with a note of triumph, “What? That’s awful. I am afraid he put one over on you.”\n\nTrue? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like to listen to truths that reflect on their judgment.\nSo, being human, I tried to defend myself. I pointed out that the best is eventually the cheapest, that one can’t\nexpect to get quality and artistic taste at bargain-basement prices, and so on and on.\n\nThe next day another friend dropped in, admired the draperies, bubbled over with enthusiasm, and\nexpressed a wish that she could afford such exquisite creations for her home. My reaction was totally different.\n“Well, to tell the truth,” I said, “I can’t afford them myself. I paid too much. I’m sorry I ordered them,”\n\nWhen we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may\nadmit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying\nto ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.\n\nHorace Greeley, the most famous editor in America during the time of the Civil War, disagreed\nviolently with Lincoln’s policies. He believed that he could drive Lincoln into agreeing with him by a campaign\nof argument, ridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter campaign month after month, year after year. In fact, he\nwrote a brutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on President Lincoln the night Booth shot him.\n\nBut did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with Greeley? Not at all. Ridicule and abuse never do. If\nyou want some excellent suggestions about dealing with people and managing yourself and improving your\npersonality, read Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography—one of the most fascinating life stories ever written, one\nof the classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells how he conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and\ntransformed himself into one of the most able, suave and diplomatic men in American history.\n\nOne day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth, an old Quaker friend took him aside and lashed\nhim with a few stinging truths, something like this:\n\nBen, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you. They\nhave become so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find they enjoy themselves better when you\nare not around. You know so much that no man can tell you anything. Indeed, no man is going to try, for the\neffort would lead only to discomfort and hard work. So you are not likely ever to know any more than you do\nnow, which is very little.\n\nOne of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is the way he accepted that smarting rebuke. He\nwas big enough and wise enough to realize that it was true, to sense that he was headed for failure and social\ndisaster. So he made a right-about-face. He began immediately to change his insolent, opinionated ways.\n\n“I made it a rule,” said Franklin, “to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiment of others, and all\npositive assertion of my own, I even forbade myself the use of every word or expression in the language that\nimported a fix’d opinion, such as ‘certainly,’ ‘undoubtedly,’ etc., and I adopted, instead of them, ‘I conceive,’ ‘I\napprehend,’ or ‘I imagine’ a thing to be so or so, or ‘it so appears to me at present.’ When another asserted\nsomething that I thought an error, I deny’d myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing\nimmediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or\ncircumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear’d or seem’d to me some\ndifference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag’d in went on\nmore pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos’d my opinions procur’d them a readier reception and less\ncontradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevaile’d with\nothers to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.\n\n\n-----\n\n“And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at length so\neasy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression\nescape me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had earned so\nmuch weight with my fellow citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much\ninfluence in public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to\nmuch hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.”\n\nHow do Ben Franklin’s methods work in business? Let’s take two examples.\n\nKatherine A, Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, is an industrial engineering supervisor for a\nyarn-processing plant. She told one of our classes how she handled a sensitive problem before and after taking\nour training:\n\n“Part of my responsibility,” she reported, “deals with setting up and maintaining incentive systems and\nstandards for our operators so they can make more money by producing more yarn. The system we were using\nhad worked fine when we had only two or three different types of yarn, but recently we had expanded our\ninventory and capabilities to enable us to run more than twelve different varieties. The present system was no\nlonger adequate to pay the operators fairly for the work being performed and give them an incentive to increase\nproduction. I had worked up a new system which would enable us to pay the operator by the class of yam she\nwas running at any one particular time. With my new system in hand, I entered the meeting determined to prove\nto the management that my system was the right approach. I told them in detail how they were wrong and\nshowed where they were being unfair and how I had all the answers they needed. To say the least, I failed\nmiserably! I had become so busy defending my position on the new system that I had left them no opening to\ngraciously admit their problems on the old one. The issue was dead.\n\n“After several sessions of this course, I realized all too well where I had made my mistakes. I called\nanother meeting and this time I asked where they felt their problems were. We discussed each point, and I asked\nthem their opinions on which was the best way to proceed. With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper\nintervals, I let them develop my system themselves. At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my\nsystem, they enthusiastically accepted it.\n\n“I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a\nperson straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making\nyourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.”",

Suppose he had told them by his tones and insinuations that they were wrong.\nSuppose that, by all the rules of logic, he had proved that they were wrong. What would have happened? More\nanger would have been stirred up, more hatred, more revolt.\n\n\n-----\n\n_If a man's heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you, you can’t win him to your way of_\n_thinking with all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging_\nwives ought to realize that people don’t want to change their minds. They can’t be forced or driven to agree\n_with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly._\n\nLincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his words: “It is an old and true maxim\nthat ‘a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall’. So with men, if you would win a man to your\ncause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which,\nsay what you will, is the great high road to his reason.”\n\nBusiness executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to strikers. For example, when 2,500\nemployees in the White Motor Company’s plant struck for higher wages and a union shop, Robert F. Black, then\npresident of the company, didn’t lose his temper and condemn and threaten and talk of tyranny and Communists.\nHe actually praised the strikers. He published an advertisement in the Cleveland papers, complimenting them on\n“the peaceful way in which they laid down their tools”. Finding the strike pickets idle, he bought them a couple\nof dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited them to play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling,\nhe rented a bowling alley.\n\nThis friendliness on Mr. Black’s part did what friendliness always does: it begot friendliness. So the\nstrikers borrowed brooms, shovels, and rubbish carts, and began picking up matches, papers, cigarette stubs, and\ncigar butts around the factory. Imagine it! Imagine strikers tidying up the factory grounds while battling for\nhigher wages and recognition of the union. Such an event had never been heard of before in the long,\ntempestuous history of American labor wars. That strike ended with a compromise settlement within a weekended without any ill feeling or rancor.\n\nDaniel Webster, who looked like a god and talked like Jehovah, was one of the most successful\nadvocates who ever pleaded a case; yet he ushered in his most powerful arguments with such friendly remarks\nas: “It will be for the jury to consider,” “This may perhaps be worth thinking of,” “Here are some facts that I\ntrust you will not lose sight of,” or “You, with your knowledge of human nature, will easily see the significance\nof these facts.” No bulldozing. No high-pressure methods. No attempt to force his opinions on others. Webster\nused the soft-spoken, quiet, friendly approach, and it helped to make him famous.\n\nYou may never be called upon to settle a strike or address a jury, but you may want to get your rent\nreduced. Will the friendly approach help you then? Let’s see.\n\nO. L. Straub, an engineer, wanted to get his rent reduced. And he knew his landlord was hard-boiled. “I\nwrote him,” Mr. Straub said in a speech before the class, “notifying him that I was vacating my apartment as\nsoon as my lease expired. The truth was, I didn’t want to move. I wanted to stay if I could get my rent reduced.\nBut the situation seemed hopeless. Other tenants had tried—and failed. Everyone told me that the landlord was\nextremely difficult to deal with. But I said to myself, ‘I am studying a course in how to deal with people, so I’ll\ntry it on him—and see how it works.’\n\n“He and his secretary came to see me as soon as he got my letter. I met him at the door with a friendly\ngreeting. I fairly bubbled with good will and enthusiasm. I didn’t begin talking about how high the rent was. I\nbegan talking about how much I liked his apartment house. Believe me, I was ‘hearty in my approbation and\nlavish in my praise.’ I complimented him on the way he ran the building and told him I should like so much to\nstay for another year but I couldn’t afford it.\n\n“He had evidently never had such a reception from a tenant. He hardly knew what to make of it.\n\n“Then he started to tell me his troubles. Complaining tenants. One had written him fourteen letters,\nsome of them positively insulting. Another threatened to break his lease unless the landlord kept the man on the\nfloor above from snoring. ‘What a relief it is,’ he said, ‘to have a satisfied tenant like you.’ And then, without\nmy even asking him to do it, he offered to reduce my rent a little. I wanted more, so I named the figure I could\nafford to pay, and he accepted without a word.\n\n“As he was leaving, he turned to me and asked, ‘What decorating can I do for you?’\n\n\n-----\n\n“If I had tried to get the rent reduced by the methods the other tenants were using, I am positive I\nshould have met with the same failure they encountered. It was the friendly, sympathetic, appreciative approach\nthat won.”\n\nDean Woodcock of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the superintendent of a department of the local electric\ncompany. His staff was called upon to repair some equipment on top of a pole. This type of work had formerly\nbeen performed by a different department and had only recently been transferred to Woodcock’s section.\nAlthough his people had been trained in the work, this was the first time they had ever actually been called upon\nto do it. Everybody in the organization was interested in seeing if and how they could handle it. Mr. Woodcock,\nseveral of his subordinate managers, and members of other departments of the utility went to see the operation.\nMany cars and trucks were there, and a number of people were standing around watching the two lone men on\ntop of the pole.\n\nGlancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the street getting out of his car with a camera. He began\ntaking pictures of the scene. Utility people are extremely conscious of public relations, and suddenly Woodcock\nrealized what this setup looked like to the man with the camera—overkill, dozens of people being called out to\ndo a two-person job. He strolled up the street to the photographer.\n\n“I see you’re interested in our operation.”\n\n“Yes, and my mother will be more than interested. She owns stock in your company. This will be an\neye-opener for her. She may even decide her investment was unwise. I’ve been telling her for years there’s a lot\nof waste motion in companies like yours. This proves it. The newspapers might like these pictures, too.”\n\n“It does look like it, doesn’t it? I’d think the same thing in your position. But this is a unique\nsituation…” and Dean Woodcock went on to explain how this was the first job of this type for his department\nand how everybody from executives down was interested. He assured the man that under normal conditions two\npeople could handle the job. The photographer put away his camera, shook Woodcock’s hand, and thanked him\nfor taking the time to explain the situation to him.\n\nDean Woodcock’s friendly approach saved his company much embarrassment and bad publicity.\n\nAnother member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton, New Hampshire, reported how by\nusing a friendly approach, he obtained a very satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.\n\n“Early in the spring,” he reported, “before the ground had thawed from the winter freezing, there was\nan unusually heavy rainstorm and the water, which normally would have run off to nearby ditches and storm\ndrains along the road, took a new course onto a building lot where I had just built a new home.",

        "page_content": "## Preface To Revised Edition\n\nThere is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into\ntrouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant\nwe break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel\n_important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in_\nhuman nature; and William James said, “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be\nappreciated.” As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge\nthat has been responsible for civilization itself.\n\nPhilosophers have been speculating on the rules of human relationships for thousands of years, and out\nof all that speculation, there has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as old as history.\nZoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China\ntwenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han.\nBuddha preached it on the bank of the Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books of\nHinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries\nago. Jesus summed it up in one thought—probably the most important rule in the world: “Do unto others as you\nwould have others do unto you.”\n\nYou want the approval of those with whom you come in contact. You want recognition of your true\nworth. You want a feeling that you are important in your little world. You don’t want to listen to cheap,\ninsincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends and associates to be, as Charles\nSchwab put it, “hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise.” All of us want that.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo let’s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would have others give unto us, How?\nWhen? Where? The answer is: All the time, everywhere.\n\nDavid G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of our classes how he handled a delicate situation\nwhen he was asked to take charge of the refreshment booth at a charity concert, “The night of the concert I\narrived at the park and found two elderly ladies in a very bad humor standing next to the refreshment stand.\nApparently each thought that she was in charge of this project. As I stood there pondering what to do, me of the\nmembers of the sponsoring committee appeared and handed me a cashbox and thanked me for taking over the\nproject. She introduced Rose and Jane as my helpers and then ran off.\n\n“A great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box was a symbol of authority (of sorts), I gave the box\nto Rose and explained that I might not be able to keep the money straight and that if she took care of it I would\nfeel better. I then suggested to Jane that she show two teenagers who had been assigned to refreshments how to\noperate the soda machine, and I asked her to be responsible for that part of the project.\n\n“The evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily counting the money, Jane supervising the\nteenagers, and me enjoying the concert.”\n\nYou don’t have to wait until you are ambassador to France or chairman of the Clambake Committee of\nyour lodge before you use this philosophy of appreciation. You can work magic with it almost every day.\n\nIf, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes when we have ordered French fries, let’s say,\n“I’m sorry to trouble you, but I prefer French fries.” She’ll probably reply, “No trouble at all” and will be glad\nto change the potatoes, because we have shown respect for her.\n\nLittle phrases such as “I’m sorry to trouble you,” “Would you be so kind as to…?” “Won't you\nplease?” “Would you mind?” “Thank you”—little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of\neveryday life—and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.\n\nLet’s take another illustration. Hall Caine’s novels—The Christian, The Deemster, The Manxman,\namong them—were all best-sellers in the early part of this century. Millions of people read his novels, countless\nmillions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had more than eight years’ schooling in his life; yet when he\ndied he was the richest literary man of his time.\n\nThe story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and ballads; so he devoured all of Dante Gabriel\nRossetti’s poetry. He even wrote a lecture chanting the praises of Rossetti’s artistic achievement and sent a copy\nto Rossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted. “Any young man who has such an exalted opinion of my ability,”\nRossetti probably said to himself, “must be brilliant,” So Rossetti invited this blacksmith’s son to come to\nLondon and act as his secretary. That was the turning point in Hall Caine’s life; for, in his new position, he met\nthe literary artists of the day. Profiting by their advice and inspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a\ncareer that emblazoned his name across the sky.\n\nHis home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became a Mecca for tourists from the far corners of the\nworld, and he left a multimillion-dollar estate. Yet—who knows—he might have died poor and unknown had he\nnot written an essay expressing his admiration for a famous man.\n\nSuch is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt appreciation.\n\nRossetti considered himself important. That is not strange, Almost everyone considers himself\nimportant, very important.\n\nThe life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone would make him feel important.\nRonald J. Rowland, who is one of the instructors of our course in California, is also a teacher of arts and crafts.\nHe wrote to us about a student named Chris in his beginning crafts class:\n\n“Chris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence, the kind of student that often does not\nreceive the attention he deserves. I also teach an advanced class that had grown to be somewhat of a status\nsymbol and a privilege for a student to have earned the right to be in it. On Wednesday, Chris was diligently\nworking at his desk. I really felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked Chris if he would like to be in\n\n\n-----\n\nthe advanced class. How I wish I could express the look in Chris’s face, the emotions in that shy fourteen-yearold boy, trying to hold back his tears.”\n\n“Who me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?”\n\n“Yes, Chris, you are good enough.”\n\nI had to leave at that point because tears were coming to my eyes. As Chris walked out of class that\nday, seemingly two inches taller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and said in a positive voice, “Thank you,\nMr. Rowland.”\n\nChris taught me a lesson I will never forget—our deep desire to feel important. To help me never forget\nthis rule, I made a sign which reads “YOU ARE IMPORTANT.\" This sign hangs in the front of the classroom\nfor all to see and to remind me that each student I face is equally important.\n\nThe unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some\nway, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance,\nand recognize it sincerely.\n\nRemember what Emerson said, “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”\n\nAnd the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the least justification for a feeling of\nachievement bolster up their egos by a show of tumult and conceit which is truly nauseating. As Shakespeare\nput it, “…man, proud man,/Dress in a little brief authority,/…Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven/As\nmake the angels weep.”\n\nI am going to tell you how business people in my own courses have applied these principles with\nremarkable results. Let’s take the case of a Connecticut attorney (because of his relatives he prefers not to have\nhis name mentioned).",

        "page_content": "## Preface To Revised Edition\n\nSo the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such a course for adults in Meriden. They\nsearched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found not one. Finally they approached one of the\nworld’s outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of\nthis group. “No,” he replied, \"I know what those adults want. But the book they need has never been written.”\n\nI knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself had been searching for years to\ndiscover a practical, working handbook on human relations.\n\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope\nyou like it.\n\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on the subject—everything from\nnewspaper columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the\nnew psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to spend one and a half years in various libraries\nreading everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring over hundreds of\nmagazine articles, searching through countless biographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages\nhad dealt with people. We read their biographies; we read the life stories of all great leaders from Julius Caesar\nto Thomas Edison. I recall that we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were\ndetermined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout\nthe ages for winning friends and influencing people.\n\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them world-famous inventors like\nMarconi and Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen\nD. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford, and explorers like Martin Johnson, and tried to\ndiscover the techniques they used in human relations.\n\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. I\nsay “short.” It was short in the beginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty\nminutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.\n\nI gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their business and social contacts, and then\ncome back to class and speak about their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an interesting\nassignment! These men and women, hungry for self-improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a\nnew kind of laboratory—the first and only laboratory of human relationships for adults that had ever existed.\n\nThis book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and\ndeveloped out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands of adults.\n\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger than a postcard. The next season we\nprinted a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen\nyears of experiment and research came this book.\n\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible\nas it sounds, I have seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives of many people.\n\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses. For years, he had driven and\ncriticized and condemned his employees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of appreciation and\nencouragement were alien to his lips. After studying the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply\naltered his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new\nspirit of teamwork. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he proudly said\nin a speech before the class: “When I used to walk through my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees\nactually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But now they are all my friends and even the\njanitor calls me by my first name.”\n\nThis employer gained more profit, more leisure and—what is infinitely more important—he found far\nmore happiness in his business and in his home.\n\n\n-----\n\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales by the use of these principles.\nMany have opened up new accounts—accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been\ngiven increased authority, increased pay. One executive reported a large increase in salary because he applied\nthese truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he\nwas sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This training not\nonly saved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion with increased pay.\n\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at the end of the course have told me\nthat their homes have been much happier since their husbands or wives started this training.\n\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases,\nin their enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn’t wait forty-eight\nhours to report their achievements at the regular session of the course.\n\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into the night discussing them with\nother members of the class. At three o’clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so shaken by a\nrealization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a new and richer world opening before him, that he\nwas unable to sleep. He didn’t sleep that night or the next day or the next night.\n\nWho was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any new theory that came along? No, far\nfrom it. He was a sophisticated, blasé dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three languages\nfluently and was a graduate of two European universities.\n\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the old school, an aristocrat whose\nforebears had served for generations as professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written\nfrom a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.\n\nAnother man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet\nfactory, declared he had learned more in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine art of\ninfluencing people than he had learned about the same subject during his four years in college. Absurd?\nLaughable? Fantastic? Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this statement with whatever adjective you wish.\nI am merely reporting, without comment, a declaration made by a conservative and eminently successful\nHarvard graduate in a public address to approximately six hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the\nevening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.\n\n“Compared to what we ought to be,” said the famous Professor William James of Harvard, “compared\nto what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and\nmental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses\npowers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.”\n\nThose powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover,\ndevelop and profit by those dormant and unused assets.\n\n“Education,” said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton University, “is the ability to meet\nlife’s situations.”",

I will\nbe in Phoenix the week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how I can help your bank\nmeet its goals.\n\nSincerely,\nBarbara L. Anderson\n\nDo you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that letter? Eleven of the twelve banks invited\nher to be interviewed, and she had a choice of which bank’s offer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson did not state\nwhat she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help them, and focused on their wants, not her own.\n\nThousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today, tired, discouraged and underpaid. Why?\nBecause they are always thinking only of what they want. They don’t realize that neither you nor I want to buy\nanything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But both of us are eternally interested in solving our problems.\nAnd if salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won’t\nneed to sell us. We’ll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying, not being sold.\n\nYet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing things from the customer’s angle. For\nexample, for many years I lived in Forest Hills, a little community of private homes in the center of Greater\nNew York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I chanced to meet a real-estate operator who had bought and\nsold property in that area for many years. He knew Forest Hills well, so I hurriedly asked him whether or not my\nstucco house was built with metal lath or hollow tile. He said he didn’t know and told me what I already knew,\nthat I could find out by calling the Forest Hills Garden Association. The following morning, I received a letter\nfrom him. Did he give me the information I wanted? He could have gotten it in sixty seconds by a telephone\ncall. But he didn’t. He told me again that I could get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him handle my\ninsurance.\n\nHe was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in helping himself.\n\nJ. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two salespeople from the same company handled\nthe same type of situation, He reported:\n\n“Several years ago I was on the management team of a small company. Headquartered near us was the\ndistrict office of a large insurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and our company was\nassigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.\n\n“One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that his company had just\nintroduced a new life insurance policy for executives and thought we might be interested later on and he would\nget back to us when he had more information on it.\n\n“The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a coffee break, and he shouted, ‘Hey\nLuke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.’ He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an\nexecutive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day (it was the same policy that Carl had\ncasually mentioned). He wanted us to have one of the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about the\ncoverage and ended saying, ‘The policy is so new, I’m going to have someone from the home office come out\ntomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let’s get the applications signed and on the way so he can have\nmore information to work with.’ His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though we still\ndid not have details. When they were made available to us, they confirmed John’s initial understanding of the\npolicy, and he not only sold each of us a policy, but later doubled our coverage.\n\n“Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us any desire for the policies.”\n\nThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly\ntries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and\none of America’s great business leaders, once said, “People who can put themselves in the place of other people\nwho can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.”\n\n\n-----\n\nIf out of reading this book you get just one thing—an increased tendency to think always in terms of\nother people’s point of view, and see things from their angle—if you get that one thing out of this book, it may\neasily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.\n\nLooking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to\nbe construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his\ndetriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the\nreceiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson\nwon by her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the\nexample of John’s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction.\n\nAnother example in which everybody gains through this principle of arousing an eager want comes\nfrom Michael E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company.\nMike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service station was holding him\nback. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape\nthat sales were declining significantly.\n\nThis manager would not listen to any of Mike’s pleas to upgrade the station. After many exhortations\nand heart-to-heart talks—all of which had no impact—Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest\nShell station in his territory.\n\nThe manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that when Mike visited him the next\ntime, his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to reach the Number One\nspot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn’t helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager,\nby showing him the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.\n\nMost people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of calculus without\never discovering how their own minds function. For instance: I once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the\nyoung college graduates who were entering the employ of the Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner\nmanufacturer. One of the participants wanted to persuade the others to play basketball in their free time, and this\nis about what he said, “I want you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few\ntimes I’ve been to the gymnasium there haven’t been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got to\nthrowing the ball around the other night—and I got a black eye. I wish all of you would come down tomorrow\nnight. I want to play basketball.”\n\nDid he talk about anything you want? You don’t want to go to a gymnasium that no one else goes to,\ndo you? You don’t care about what he wants. You don’t want to get a black eye.\n\nCould he have shown you how to get the things you want by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep.\nKeener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games. Basketball.\n\nTo repeat Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who\n_can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way._\n\nOne of the students in the author’s training course was worried about his little boy. The child was\nunderweight and refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and nagged. “Mother\nwants you to eat this and that.” “Father wants you to grow up to be a big man.”\n\nDid the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as you pay to one fleck of sand on a\nsandy beach.",

Keep notes in the back of this book showing how and when you have applied these principles.\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART ONE\n\n### Fundamental Techniques In Handling People\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1\n\n###### “IF YOU WANT TO GATHER HONEY, DON’T KICK OVER THE BEEHIVE.”\n\nOn May 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New York City had ever known had come to its climax.\nAfter weeks of search, “Two Gun” Crowley—the killer, the gunman who didn’t smoke or drink—was at bay,\ntrapped in his sweetheart’s apartment on West End Avenue.\n\nOne hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his top-floor hideaway. They chopped\nholes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the “cop killer,” with teargas. Then they mounted their\nmachine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New York’s fine residential areas\nreverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an\nover-stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like\nit ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New York.\n\nWhen Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun\ndesperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. “He will kill,”\nsaid the Commissioner, “at the drop of a feather.”\n\nBut how did “Two Gun” Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into\nhis apartment, he wrote a letter addressed “To whom it may concern, ” and, as he wrote, the blood flowing from\nhis wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter Crowley said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a\nkind one—one that would do nobody any harm.”\n\nA short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girlfriend on a country road\nout on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said, “Let me see your license.”\n\nWithout saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As\nthe dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer’s revolver, and fired another bullet into\nthe prostrate body. And that was the killer who said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one—one that\nwould do nobody any harm.’\n\nCrowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he\nsay, “This is what I get for killing people”? No, he said, “This is what I get for defending myself.”\n\nThe point of the story is this: “Two Gun” Crowley didn’t blame himself for anything.\n\nIs that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this:\n\n“I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good\ntime, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.”\n\nThat’s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America’s most notorious Public Enemy—the most sinister gang\nleader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn’t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public\nbenefactor—an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.\n\nAnd so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one\nof New York’s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he\nbelieved it.\n\nI have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York’s\ninfamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that “few of the criminals in Sing\nSing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They\ncan tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of\n\n\n-----\n\nreasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their anti-social acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly\nmaintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.”\n\nIf Al Capone, “Two Gun” Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison\nwalls don’t blame themselves for anything—what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?\n\nJohn Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed, “I learned thirty years ago\nthat it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact\nthat God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.”\n\nWanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for a third\nof a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize\nthemselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.\n\nCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify\nhimself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and\narouses resentment.\n\nB. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded\nfor good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal\npunished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not\nmake lasting changes and often incur resentment.\n\nHans Selye, another great psychologist, said, “As much as we thirst for approval, we dread\ncondemnation.”\n\nThe resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and\nstill not correct the situation that has been condemned.\n\nGeorge B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company. One of\nhis responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He\nreported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of\nauthority of the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after\nhe left, the workers would remove the hats.\n\nHe decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their\nhard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant\ntone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the\njob. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.",

  "response": "Part Three of the document is titled **\"How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking.\"** This section focuses on strategies and principles that can help individuals persuade others and effectively communicate their ideas. Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts and chapters within this part:\n\n### Overview of Part Three\n- **Objective**: The main goal of this section is to provide readers with techniques to influence others positively and to win them over to their perspectives without causing conflict or resentment.\n- **Emphasis on Understanding**: The principles outlined in this part stress the importance of empathy, respect, and tact when engaging with others, aiming to foster cooperation and agreement.\n\n### Key Chapters and Principles\n1. **Chapter 10: You can’t win an argument**  \n   - **Principle**: Avoid arguments as they often lead to entrenched positions rather than agreement. Winning an argument may alienate the other person.\n  \n2. **Chapter 11: A sure way of making enemies—and how to avoid it**  \n   - **Principle**: Criticism and condemnation can create enemies. Instead, approach disagreements with understanding and respect for differing opinions.\n\n3. **Chapter 12: If you're wrong, admit it**  \n   - **Principle**: Acknowledging your mistakes quickly and sincerely can disarm opposition and foster goodwill.\n\n4. **Chapter 13: A drop of honey**  \n   - **Principle**: Use kindness and positive reinforcement to influence others, as a friendly approach is more effective than a harsh one.\n\n5. **Chapter 14: The secret of Socrates**  \n   - **Principle**: Encourage others to arrive at their conclusions by asking questions rather than making statements, which helps them feel involved in the process.\n\n6. **Chapter 15: The safety valve in handling complaints**  \n   - **Principle**: Allow others to express their grievances and frustrations. Listening can help diffuse tension and lead to constructive solutions.\n\n7. **Chapter 16: How To Get Cooperation**  \n   - **Principle**: Foster cooperation by appealing to shared interests and mutual benefits rather than imposing demands.\n\n8. **Chapter 17: A formula that will work wonders for you**  \n   - **Principle**: Use a structured approach to communication that emphasizes understanding the other person's perspective.\n\n9. **Chapter 18: What everybody wants**  \n   - **Principle**: Recognize that everyone has a desire for appreciation and respect. Addressing these needs can help in persuading others.\n\n10. **Chapter 19: An appeal that everybody likes**  \n    - **Principle**: Frame your requests in a way that appeals to the other person's values and desires.\n\n11. **Chapter 20: The movies do it. TV does it. Why don't you do it?**  \n    - **Principle**: Use storytelling and engaging narratives to communicate your ideas effectively, as people are naturally drawn to stories.\n\n12. **Chapter 21: When nothing else works, try this**  \n    - **Principle**: In difficult situations, employing a unique or unexpected approach can capture attention and foster agreement.\n\n### Conclusion of Part Three\nPart Three emphasizes that successful persuasion is not about manipulation but rather about understanding, respect, and genuine engagement with others. By applying these principles, individuals can improve their ability to influence others positively, fostering better relationships and achieving desired outcomes without causing resentment or conflict. The overall message is that effective communication is rooted in empathy and the ability to see things from the other person's perspective.",
