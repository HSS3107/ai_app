How did he do it? Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and toothis and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it,\nhe suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about\nthe refusal, He immediately changed the other person’s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the\ninvitation.\n\nGunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an employee in the food store he\nmanaged who was negligent about putting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were displayed.\nThis caused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders, admonitions, confrontations, with her about this\ndid not do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his office and told her he was appointing her\nSupervisor of Price Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the shelves\nproperly tagged. This new responsibility and title changed her attitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties\nsatisfactorily from then on.\n\nChildish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he created the Legion of Honor and\ndistributed 15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made eighteen of his generals “Marshals of France” and called his\ntroops the “Grand Army.” Napoleon was criticized for giving “toys” to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon\nreplied, “Men are ruled by toys.”\n\nThis technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and it will work for you. For\nexample, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running across and\ndestroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither worked. Then she tried giving the worst\nsinner in the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him her “detective” and put him in charge of\nkeeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her problem. Her “detective” built a bonfire in the backyard,\nheated an iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the lawn.\n\nThe effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change\nattitudes or behavior:\n\n1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and\nconcentrate on the benefits to the other person.\n\n2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.\n\n3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.\n\n4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.\n\n5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.\n\n_6._ When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he\npersonally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: “John, we have customers coming in tomorrow\nand I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish\nthe counter.” Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the\ntask: “John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it\n_later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the_\nstockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and\npolish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good\n_company image.”_\n\nWill John be happy about doing what you suggest? Probably not very happy, but happier than if you\nhad not pointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is\ninterested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been\npointed out to John that the job would have to be done eventually and by doing it now, he won’t be faced with it\nlater.\n\nIt is naive to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these\napproaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this way than\n\n-----\n\nby not using these principles—and if you increase your successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become\n10 percent more effective as a leader than you were before—and that is your benefit.\n\nPeople are more likely to do what you would like them to do when you use…\n\n**PRINCIPLE 9**\n**_Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**BE A LEADER**\n\n**A leader’s job often includes changing your people’s attitudes and behavior. Some suggestions to**\n**accomplish this:**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**Begin with praise and honest appreciation.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 5**\n**Let the other person save face.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 6**\n**Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.

They approached it with a\n“We can do it” attitude, and the order was accepted, produced and delivered on time.\n\n-----\n\nAn effective leader will use…\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**_Ask questions instead of giving direct orders._**\n\n-----\n\n## 26\n\n###### “LET THE OTHER PERSON SAVE FACE.”\n\nYears ago the General Electric Company was faced with the delicate task of removing Charles\nSteinmetz from the head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came to electricity,\nwas a failure as the head of the calculating department. Yet the company didn’t dare offend the man. He was\nindispensable—and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They made him Consulting Engineer of the\nGeneral Electric Company—a new title for work he was already doing—and let someone else head up the\ndepartment.\n\nSteinmetz was happy.\n\nSo were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered their most temperamental star, and they had\ndone it without a storm—by letting him save face.\n\nLetting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop to\nthink of it! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats,\ncriticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person’s pride.\nWhereas a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person’s\nattitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting!\n\nLet’s remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful necessity of discharging or\nreprimanding an employee.\n\n“Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun.” (I’m quoting now from a letter\nwritten me by Marshall A. Granger, a certified public accountant.) “Our business is mostly seasonal. Therefore\nwe have to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush is over.\n\nIt’s a byword in our profession that no one enjoys wielding the ax. Consequently, the custom has\ndeveloped of getting it over as soon as possible, and usually in the following way: ‘Sit down, Mr. Smith. The\nseason’s over, and we don’t seem to see any more assignments for you. Of course, you understood you were\nonly employed for the busy season anyhow, etc., etc.’\n\n“The effect on these people is one of disappointment and a feeling of being ‘let down.’ Most of them\nare in the accounting field for life, and they retain no particular love for the firm that drops them so casually.\n\n“I recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go with a little more tact and consideration. So I call\neach one in only after carefully thinking over his or her work during the winter. And I’ve said something like\nthis: ‘Mr. Smith, you’ve done a fine job (if he has). That time we sent you to Newark, you had a tough\nassignment. You were on the spot, but you came through with flying colors, and we want you to know the firm\nis proud of you. You’ve got the stuff—you’re going a long way, wherever you’re working. This firm believes in\nyou, and is rooting for you, and we don’t want you to forget it.’\n\n“Effect? The people go away feeling a lot better about being fired. They don’t feel ‘let down.’ They\nknow if we had work for them, we’d keep them on. And when we need them again, they come to us with a keen\npersonal affection.”\n\nAt one session of our course, two class members discussed the negative effects of faultfinding versus\nthe positive effects of letting the other person save face.\n\nFred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that occurred in his company: “At one of\nour production meetings, a vice president was asking very pointed questions of one of our production\nsupervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was aggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty\nperformance on the part of the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed in front of his peers, the supervisor\n\n-----\n\nwas evasive in his responses. This caused the vice president to lose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse\nhim of lying.\n\n“Any working relationship that might have existed prior to this encounter was destroyed in a few brief\nmoments. This supervisor, who was basically a good worker, was useless to our company from that time on. A\nfew months later he left our firm and went to work for a competitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job.”\n\nAnother class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a similar incident had occurred at her job - but\nwhat a difference in approach and results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing specialist for a food packer, was given her\nfirst major assignment—the test-marketing of a new product. She told the class: “When the results of the test\ncame in, I was devastated. I had made a serious error in my planning, and the entire test had to be done all over\nagain. To make this worse, I had no time to discuss it with my boss before the meeting in which I was to make\nmy report on the project.\n\n“When I was called on to give the report, I was shaking with fright. I had all I could do to keep from\nbreaking down, but I resolved I would not cry and have all those men make remarks about women not being\nable to handle a management job because they are too emotional. I made my report briefly and stated that due to\nan error I would repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat down, expecting my boss to blow up.\n\n“Instead, he thanked me for my work and remarked that it was not unusual for a person to make an\nerror on a new project and that he had confidence that the repeat survey would be accurate and meaningful to\nthe company. He assured me, in front of all my colleagues, that he had faith in me and I knew I had done my\nbest, and that my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was the reason for the failure.\n\nI left that meeting with my head in the air and with the determination that I would never let that boss of\nmine down again.”\n\nEven if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone\nto lose face. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote: \"I have no right\nto say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what\nhe thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.”\n\nA real leader will always follow…\n\n**PRINCIPLE 5**\n**_Let the other person save face._**\n\n-----\n\n## 27\n\n###### “HOW TO SPUR PEOPLE ON TO SUCCESS.”\n\nPete Barlow was an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and-pony act and spent his life traveling with\ncircuses and vaudeville shows. I loved to watch Pete train new dogs for his act. I noticed that the moment a dog\nshowed the slightest improvement, Pete patted and praised him and gave him meat and made a great to-do about\nit.\n\nThat’s nothing new. Animal trainers have been using that same technique for centuries.\n\nWhy, I wonder, don’t we use the same common sense when trying to change people that we use when\ntrying to change dogs? Why don’t we use meat instead of a whip? Why don’t we use praise instead of\ncondemnation? Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on\nimproving.\n\nIn his book I Ain’t Much, Baby—But I’m All I _Got, the psychologist Jess Lair comments, “Praise is like_\nsunlight to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too\nready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm\nsunshine of praise.” *\n\n_* Jess Lair, I Ain’t Much, Baby—But I’m All I Got (Greenwich, Conn.: Fawcett, 1976), p . 248._",

Let the\nother people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do. So ask them\nquestions. Let them tell you a few things.\n\nIf you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But don’t. It is dangerous. They won’t pay\nattention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen patiently and\nwith an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.\n\nDoes this policy pay in business? Let’s see. Here is the story of a sales representative who was forced\nto try it.\n\nOne of the largest automobile manufacturers in the United States was negotiating for a year’s\nrequirements of upholstery fabrics. Three important manufacturers had worked up fabrics in sample bodies.\nThese had all been inspected by the executives of the motor company, and notice had been sent to each\nmanufacturer saying that, on a certain day, a representative from each supplier would be given an opportunity to\nmake a final plea for the contract.\n\nG.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived in town with a severe attack of laryngitis. “When\nit came my turn to meet the executives in conference,” Mr. R---- said as he related the story before one of my\nclasses, “I had lost my voice. I could hardly whisper. I was ushered into a room and found myself face to face\nwith the textile engineer, the purchasing agent, the director of sales and the president of the company. I stood up\nand made a valiant effort to speak, but I couldn’t do anything more than squeak.\n\n“They were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper: ‘Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I\nam speechless.’\n\n“‘I’ll do the talking for you,’ the president said. He did. He exhibited my samples and praised their\ngood points. A lively discussion arose about the merits of my goods. And the president, since he was talking for\nme, took the position I would have had during the discussion. My sole participation consisted of smiles, nods\nand a few gestures.\n\n“As a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract, which called for over half a million\nyards of upholstery fabrics at an aggregate value of $1,600,000—the biggest order I had ever received.\n\n“I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn’t lost my voice, because I had the wrong idea about the\nwhole proposition. I discovered, quite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to let the other person do the\ntalking.’\n\nLetting the other person do the talking helps in family situations as well as in business. Barbara\nWilson’s relationship with her daughter, Laurie, was deteriorating rapidly. Laurie, who had been a quiet,\ncomplacent child, had grown into an uncooperative, sometimes belligerent teenager. Mrs. Wilson lectured her,\nthreatened her and punished her, but all to no avail.\n\n“One day,” Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, “I just gave up. Laurie had disobeyed me and had left\nthe house to visit her girl friend before she had completed her chores. When she returned I was about to scream\nat her for the ten-thousandth time, but I just didn’t have the strength to do it. I just looked at her and said sadly,\n‘Why, Laurie, Why?’\n\n“Laurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked, ‘Do you really want to know?’ I nodded and\nLaurie told me, first hesitantly, and then it all flowed out. I had never listened to her. I was always telling her to\ndo this or that. When she wanted to tell me her thoughts, feelings, ideas, I interrupted with more orders. I began\n\n-----\n\nto realize that she needed me—not as a bossy mother, but as a confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about\ngrowing up. And all I had been doing was talking when I should have been listening. I never heard her.\n\n“From that time on I let her do all the talking she wanted. She tells me what is on her mind, and our\nrelationship has improved immeasurably. She is again a cooperative person.”\n\nA large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New York newspaper calling for a person\nwith unusual ability and experience. Charles T. Cubellis answered the advertisement, sending his reply to a box\nnumber. A few days later, he was invited by letter to call for an interview. Before he called, he spent hours in\nWall Street finding out everything possible about the person who had founded the business. During the\ninterview, he remarked, “I should be mighty proud to be associated with an organization with a record like yours.\nI understand you started twenty-eight years ago with nothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that true?”\n\nAlmost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early struggles. This man was no exception.\nHe talked for a long time about how he had started with $450 in cash and an original idea. He told how he had\nfought against discouragement and battled against ridicule, working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen\nhours a day; how he had finally won against all odds until now the most important executives on Wall Street\nwere coming to him for information and guidance. He was proud of such a record. He had a right to be, and he\nhad a splendid time telling about it. Finally, he questioned Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called\nin one of his vice presidents and said, “I think this is the person we are looking for.”\n\nMr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the accomplishments of his prospective employer.\nHe showed an interest in the other person and his problems. He encouraged the other person to do most of the\ntalking—and made a favorable impression.\n\nRoy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite problem. He listened as a good prospect\nfor a sales position talked himself into a job with Bradley’s firm, Roy reported:\n\n“Being a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits, such as hospitalization, medical insurance\nand pensions. Every representative is an independent agent. We don’t even provide leads for prospects, as we\ncannot advertise for them as our larger competitors do.\n\n“Richard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted for this position, and he was interviewed first by\nmy assistant, who told him about all the negatives related to this job. He seemed slightly discouraged when he\ncame into my office. I mentioned the one benefit of being associated with my firm, that of being an independent\ncontractor and therefore virtually being self-employed.\n\n“As he talked about these advantages to me, he talked himself out of each negative thought he had\nwhen he came in for the interview. Several times it seemed as though he was half talking to himself as he was\nthinking through each thought. At times I was tempted to add to his thoughts; however, as the interview came to\na close I felt he had convinced himself, very much on his own, that he would like to work for my firm.\n\n“Because I had been a good listener and let Dick do most of the talking, he was able to weigh both\nsides fairly in his mind, and he came to the positive conclusion, which was a challenge he created for himself.\nWe hired him and he has been an outstanding representative for our firm.”\n\nEven our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast about\nours. La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said, “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want\nfriends, let your friends excel you.”\n\nWhy is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them,\nthey—or at least some of them—will feel inferior and envious.",

Can’t you say the same thing about your life? History is replete with striking illustrations of the sheer\nwitchery raise.\n\nFor example, many years ago a boy of ten was working in a factory in Naples, He longed to be a singer,\nbut his first teacher discouraged him. “You can’t sing,” he said. “You haven’t any voice at all. It sounds like the\nwind in the shutters.”\n\nBut his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms about him and praised him and told him she knew\nhe could sing, she could already see an improvement, and she went barefoot in order to save money to pay for\nhis music lessons. That peasant mother’s praise and encouragement changed that boy’s life. His name was\nEnrico Caruso, and he became the greatest and most famous opera singer of his age.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to be a writer. But everything seemed\nto be against him. He had never been able to attend school more than four years. His father had been flung in jail\nbecause he couldn’t pay his debts, and this young man often knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job\npasting labels on bottles of blacking in a rat-infested warehouse, and he slept at night in a dismal attic room with\ntwo other boys—guttersnipes from the slums of London. He had so little confidence in his ability to write that\nhe sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript in the dead of night so nobody would laugh at him. Story after\nstory was refused. Finally the great day came when one was accepted. True, he wasn’t paid a shilling for it, but\none editor had praised him. One editor had given him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly\naround the streets with tears rolling down his cheeks.\n\nThe praise, the recognition, that he received through getting one story in print, changed his whole life,\nfor if it hadn’t been for that encouragement, he might have spent his entire life working in rat-infested factories.\nYou may have heard of that boy. His name was Charles Dickens.\n\nAnother boy in London made his living as a clerk in a dry-goods store. He had to get up at five o’clock,\nsweep out the store, and slave for fourteen hours a day. It was sheer drudgery and he despised it. After two years,\nhe could stand it no longer, so he got up one morning and, without waiting for breakfast, tramped fifteen miles\nto talk to his mother, who was working as a housekeeper.\n\nHe was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He swore he would kill himself if he had to remain in\nthe shop any longer. Then he wrote a long, pathetic letter to his old schoolmaster, declaring that he was\n\n-----\n\nheartbroken, that he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster gave him a little praise and assured him that\nhe really was very intelligent and fitted for finer things and offered him a job as a teacher.\n\nThat praise changed the future of that boy and made a lasting impression on the history of English\nliterature. For that boy went on to write innumerable best-selling books and made over a million dollars with his\npen. You’ve probably heard of him. His name: H. G. Wells.\n\nUse of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B. F. Skinner’s teachings. This great\ncontemporary psychologist has shown by experiments with animals and with humans that when criticism is\nminimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will\natrophy for lack of attention.\n\nJohn Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, used this in dealing with his children. It seemed\nthat, as in so many families, mother and dad’s chief form of communication with the children was yelling at\nthem. And, as in so many cases, the children became a little worse rather than better after each such session and so did the parents. There seemed to be no end in sight for this problem.\n\nMr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles he was learning in our course to solve this\nsituation. He reported, “We decided to try praise instead of harping on their faults. It wasn’t easy when all we\ncould see were the negative things they were doing; it was really tough to find things to praise. We managed to\nfind something, and within the first day or two some of the really upsetting things they were doing quit\nhappening. Then some of their other faults began to disappear. They began capitalizing on the praise we were\ngiving them. They even began going out of their way to do things right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course,\nit didn’t last forever, but the norm reached after things leveled off was so much better. It was no longer\nnecessary to react the way we used to. The children were doing far more right things than wrong ones.” All of\nthis was a result of praising the slightest improvement in the children rather than condemning everything they\ndid wrong.\n\nThis works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland Hills, California, applied this principle to a\nsituation in his company. Some material came to him in his print shop which was of exceptionally high quality.\nThe printer who had done this job was a new employee who had been having difficulty adjusting to the job. His\nsupervisor was upset about what he considered a negative attitude and was seriously thinking of terminating his\nservices.\n\nWhen Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he personally went over to the print shop and had a\ntalk with the young man. He told him how pleased he was with the work he had just received and pointed out it\nwas the best work he had seen produced in that shop for some time. He pointed out exactly why it was superior\nand how important the young man’s contribution was to the company,\n\nDo you think this affected that young printer’s attitude toward the company? Within days there was a\ncomplete turnabout. He told several of his co-workers about the conversation and how someone in the company\nreally appreciated good work. And from that day on, he was a loyal and dedicated worker.\n\nWhat Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say, “You’re good.” He specifically\npointed out how his work was superior. Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just\nmaking general flattering remarks, his praise became much more meaningful to the person to whom it was given.\nEverybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere—not something the other\nperson may be saying just to make one feel good.\n\nRemember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But\nnobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.\n\nLet me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am\nnot advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.\n\nTalk about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with whom we come in contact to a\nrealization of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far more than change people. We can literally\ntransform them.\n\n-----\n\nExaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from William James, one of the most distinguished\npsychologists and philosophers America has ever produced: “Compared with what we ought to be, we are only\nhalf awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing\nbroadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he\nhabitually fails to use.”",

You did it.”\n\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t want him to do it—none of these\nthings kept the bed dry. So the parents asked, “How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”\n\nWhat were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like\nGrandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a\npair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object.\n\nHis mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said, “Here is a\nlittle gentleman who would like to do some shopping.”\n\nThe salesgirl made him feel important by saying, “Young man, what can I show you?”\n\nHe stood a couple of inches taller and said, “I want to buy a bed for myself.”\n\nWhen he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was\npersuaded to buy it.\n\nThe bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to the\ndoor shouting, “Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!”\n\nThe father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab’s injunction: he was “hearty in his approbation\nand lavish in his praise.”\n\n“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father said. “Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this\nbed.” The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it.\nAnd he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.\n\nAnother father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn’t get his threeyear-old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility.\nSo the parents asked themselves, “How can we make her want to do it?”\n\nThe little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a\nchair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen\nwhile she was stirring the cereal and she said, “Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.”\n\nShe ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She had\nachieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.\n\nWilliam Winter once remarked that “self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why\ncan’t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making\n\n-----\n\nothers think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own;\nthey will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.\n\nRemember: “First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world\nwith him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.\"\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Arouse in the other person an eager want._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_Don’t criticize, condemn or complain._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Give honest and sincere appreciation._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Arouse in the other person an eager want._**\n\n-----\n\n# PART TWO\n\n### Six Ways To Make People Like You\n\n-----\n\n## 4\n\n###### “DO THIS AND YOU’LL BE WELCOME ANYWHERE.”\n\nWhy read this book to find out how to win friends? Why not study the technique of the greatest winner\nof friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When\nyou get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of\nhis skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there\nare no ulterior motives: he doesn’t want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn’t want to marry you.\n\nDid you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn’t have to work for a living? A hen\nhas to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you\nnothing but love.\n\nWhen I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired pup for fifty cents. He was the light\nand joy of my childhood. Every afternoon about four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes\nstaring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through the\nbuck brush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of sheer\necstasy.\n\nTippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic night—I shall never forget it—he\nwas killed within ten feet of my head, killed by lightning. Tippy’s death was the tragedy of my boyhood.\n\nYou never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn’t need to. You knew by some divine instinct\nthat you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in\ntwo years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that. You can make more friends in two\nmonths by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested\nin you.\n\nYet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into\nbecoming interested in them.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are\ninterested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.\n\nThe New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out\nwhich word is the most frequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun “I.” “I.” “I.” It was used\n3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. “I.” “I.” “I.” “I.” When you see a group photograph that you are in,\nwhose picture do you look for first?\n\nIf we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true,\nsincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.\n\nNapoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said, “Josephine, I have been as fortunate\nas any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can\nrely.” And historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.\n\nAlfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book entitled What Life Should Mean to You.\nIn that book he says, “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties\nin life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures\nspring.”\n\nYou may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming across a statement more\nsignificant for you and for me. Adler’s statement is so rich with meaning that I am going to repeat it in italics: It\n_is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the_\n_greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring._\n\n-----\n\nI once took a course in short-story writing at New York University, and during that course the editor of\na leading magazine talked to our class. He said he could pick up any one of the dozens of stories that drifted\nacross his desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he could feel whether or not the author liked\npeople. “If the author doesn’t like people,” he said, “people won’t like his or her stories.”\n\nThis hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on fiction writing and apologized for\npreaching a sermon. “I am telling you,” he said, “the same things your preacher would tell you, but remember,\nyou have to be interested in people if you want to be a successful writer of stories.”\n\nIf that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing with people face-to-face.",

Drifting into the President’s private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his secretaries, “That’s a\npretty dress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very attractive young woman.”\n\nThat was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever bestowed upon a secretary in his life. It\nwas so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, “Now, don’t get\nstuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you would be a little bit more careful with\nyour punctuation.”\n\nHis method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to listen to\nunpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.\n\nA barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what McKinley did back in 1896,\nwhen he was running for President. One of the prominent Republicans of that day had written a campaign\nspeech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster all rolled into one.\nWith great glee, this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley. The speech had its fine points, but it just\nwouldn’t do. It would have raised a tornado of criticism. McKinley didn’t want to hurt the man’s feelings. He\nmust not kill the man’s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say ‘no’. Note how adroitly he did it.\n\n“My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,” McKinley said. “No one could have\nprepared a better one. There are many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say, but is it\nquite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your standpoint, I must consider its\neffect from the party’s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech along the lines I indicate, and send me\na copy of it.”\n\nHe did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his second speech, and he became one\nof the effective speakers of the campaign.\n\nHere is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was\nwritten to Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln\nprobably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars,\nand that, by the way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard work. The\nletter was written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For\neighteen months, Lincoln’s generals had been leading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another.\nNothing but futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers had deserted from\nthe army, and then the Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the\nWhite House. “We are now on the brink of destruction,” Lincoln said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is\nagainst us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.” Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter came.\n\nI am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to change an obstreperous general\nwhen the very fate of the nation could have depended upon the general’s action.\n\nThis is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became President; yet you will note that\nhe praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave faults.\n\nYes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn’t call them that. Lincoln was more conservative, more\ndiplomatic. Lincoln wrote, “There are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.” Talk\nabout tact! And diplomacy!\n\nHere is the letter addressed to General Hooker:\n\nI have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac.\n\n-----\n\nOf course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for\nyou to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.\n\nI believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix\npolitics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not\nan indispensable quality.\n\nYou are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm, But I think that\nduring General Burnside’s command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as\nmuch as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable\nbrother officer.\n\nI have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the\nGovernment needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you command.\n\nOnly those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you is military\nsuccess and I will risk the dictatorship.\n\nThe Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has\ndone and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the army, of\ncriticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as\nfar as I can, to put it down.\n\nNeither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such spirit\nprevails in it, and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go\nforward and give us victories.\n\nYou are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know whether this philosophy will\noperate for you in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let’s see. Let’s take the case of W. P. Gaw of the Wark\nCompany, Philadelphia.\n\nThe Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large office building in Philadelphia by a\ncertain specified date. Everything was going along well; the building was almost finished, when suddenly the\nsub-contractor making the ornamental bronze work to go on the exterior of this building declared that he\ncouldn’t make delivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All\nbecause of one man!\n\nLong-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent\nto New York to beard the bronze lion in his den.\n\n“Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name?” Mr Gaw asked the president of\nthe subcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced. The president was surprised. “No, I didn’t know\nthat.”\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Gaw, “when I got off the train this morning, I looked in the telephone book to get\nyour address, and you’re the only person in the Brooklyn phone book with your name.”",

Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This_\nonly raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding.\n\n_Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and_\nareas on which you agree.\n\n_Be honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will_\nhelp disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness.\n\n_Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents_\nmay be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and\nfind yourself in a position where your opponents can say, “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.”\n\n_Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is_\ninterested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn\nyour opponents into friends.\n\n_Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be_\nheld later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask\nyourself some hard questions:\n\nCould my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my\nreaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my\nopponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of\nme? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow\nover? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?\n\n- Bits and Pieces, published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J.\n\n-----\n\nOpera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said, “My wife and I made a pact\na long time ago, and we’ve kept it no matter how angry we’ve grown with each other. When one yells, the other\nshould listen, because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it._**\n\n-----\n\n## 11\n\n###### “A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIES—AND HOW TO AVOID IT.”\n\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed that if he could be right 75 percent of\nthe time, he would reach the highest measure of his expectation.\n\nIf that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men of the twentieth century could\nhope to obtain, what about you and me?\n\nIf you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make\na million dollars a day. If you can’t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other\npeople they are wrong?\n\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can\nin words—and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have\nstruck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike\nback. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato\nor an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.\n\nNever begin by announcing “I am going to prove so-and-so to you.” That’s bad. That’s tantamount to\nsaying, “I’m smarter than you are, I’m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.”\n\nThat is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before you\neven start.\n\nIt is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change people’s minds. So why make it\nharder? Why handicap yourself?\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one\nwill feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you\ntaught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot.\n\nOver three hundred years ago Galileo said, “You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him\nto find it within himself.”\n\nAs Lord Chesterfield said to his son, “Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.”\n\nSocrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens, “One thing only I know, and that is that I know\nnothing.”\n\nWell, I can’t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling people they are wrong. And I\nfind that it pays.\n\nIf a person makes a statement that you think is wrong—yes, even that you know is wrong—isn’t it\nbetter to begin by saying, “Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I\nam wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\nThere’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as, “I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the\nfacts.”\n\nNobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to\nyour saying, “I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\n-----\n\nOne of our class members who used this approach in dealing with customers was Harold Reinke, a\nDodge dealer in Billings, Montana. He reported that because of the pressures of the automobile business, he was\noften hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers’ complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of\nbusiness and general unpleasantness.\n\nHe told his class, “Recognizing that this was getting me nowhere fast, I tried a new tack. I would say\nsomething like this, ‘Our dealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently ashamed. We may have\nerred in your case. Tell me about it.’\n\n“This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the customer releases his feelings, he is\nusually much more reasonable when it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers have thanked me\nfor having such an understanding attitude. And two of them have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In\nthis highly competitive market, we need more of this type of customer, and I believe that showing respect for all\ncustomers’ opinions and treating them diplomatically and courteously will help beat the competition.”\n\nYou will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and\ninspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit\nthat he, too, may be wrong.\n\nIf you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell him or her so, what happens? Let me\nillustrate. Mr. S---- a young New York attorney, once argued a rather important case before the United States\nSupreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280 U.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of money\nand an important question of law. During the argument, one of the Supreme Court justices said to him, “The\nstatute of limitations in admiralty law is six years, is it not?”\n\nMr. S---- stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment, and then said bluntly, “Your Honor, there is no\nstatute of limitations in admiralty.”\n\n“A hush fell on the court,” said Mr. S---- as he related his experience to one of the author’s classes,\n“and the temperature in the room seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice—was wrong. And I had told him\nso. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke\nbetter than I ever spoke before. But I didn’t persuade. I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and\nfamous man that he was wrong.”",

The first shipment of these\nmachines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So\nwe should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how\nthey can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send\nmy car for you at any hour you specify.\n\n“I was surprised to get that letter,” Dr. L ---- said as he related the incident before the class. “I was both\nsurprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel\nimportant. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the\nequipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I liked it.\n\n“Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that equipment for the hospital was my\nown. I sold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.”\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance” stated, “In every work of genius we recognize our\nown rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”\n\nColonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in national and international affairs while\nWoodrow Wilson occupied the White House. Wilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice\nmore than he did upon even members of his own cabinet.\n\nWhat method did the Colonel use in influencing the President? Fortunately, we know, for House\nhimself revealed it to Arthur D. Howden Smith, and Smith quoted House in an article in The Saturday Evening\n_Post:_\n\n“‘After I got to know the President,’ House said, ‘I learned the best way to convert him to an idea was\nto plant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in it—so as to get him thinking about it on his own\naccount. The first time this worked it was an accident. I had been visiting him at the White House and urged a\npolicy on him which he appeared to disapprove. But several days later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear\nhim trot out my suggestion as his own.’”\n\nDid House interrupt him and say, “That’s not your idea. That’s mine”? Oh, no. Not House. He was too\nadroit for that. He didn’t care about credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea was\nhis. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson public credit for these ideas.\n\nLet’s remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So let’s\nuse Colonel House’s technique.\n\n-----\n\nA man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New Brunswick used this technique on me and won\nmy patronage. I was planning at the time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the\ntourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and address were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately\noverwhelmed with scores of letters and booklets and printed testimonials from camps and guides. I was\nbewildered. I didn’t know which to choose. Then one camp owner did a clever thing. He sent me the names and\ntelephone numbers of several New York people who had stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone\nthem and discover for myself what he had to offer.\n\nI found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I telephoned him, found out what his\nexperience had been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.\n\nThe others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself. That organization\nwon. Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that readers of this book might use\ntoday:\n\n“The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep\nbelow them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men,\nputteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place\nbe above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 7**\n**_Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers._**\n\n-----\n\n## 17\n\n###### “A FORMULA THAT WILL WORK WONDERS FOR YOU.”\n\nRemember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any\nfool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.\n\nThere is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason—and you have\nthe key to his actions, perhaps to his personality. Try honestly to put yourself in his place.\n\nIf you say to yourself, “How would I feel, how would I react if I were in his shoes?” you will save\nyourself time and irritation, for “by becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.”\nAnd, in addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human relationships.\n\n“Stop a minute,” says Kenneth M. Goode in his book How to Turn People Into Gold, “stop a minute to\ncontrast your keen interest in your own affairs with your mild concern about anything else. Realize then, that\neverybody else in the world feels exactly the same way! Then, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have\ngrasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; namely, that success in dealing with people\ndepends on a sympathetic grasp of the other persons’ viewpoint.”\n\nSam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that she spent too much time working on\ntheir lawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing, cutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn’t look any better than it\nhad when they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally, she was distressed by his remarks, and each\ntime he made such remarks the balance of the evening was ruined.\n\nAfter taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how foolish he had been all those years. It never\noccurred to him that she enjoyed doing that work and she might really appreciate a compliment on her diligence.\n\nOne evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some weeds and invited him to keep her\ncompany. He first declined, but then thought better of it and went out after her and began to help her pull weeds.\nShe was visibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard work and pleasant conversation.\n\nAfter that he often helped her with the gardening and complimented her on how fine the lawn looked,\nwhat a fantastic job she was doing with a yard where the soil was like concrete. Result: a happier life for both\nbecause he had learned to look at things from her point of view—even if the subject was only weeds.\n\nIn his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg commented, “Cooperativeness in\nconversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as\nyour own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation,\ngoverning what you say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener, and accepting his or her\nviewpoint will encourage the listener to have an open mind to your ideas.” *\n\n- Dr Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.\n\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home. Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I\nall but worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off\nby needless fires. These fires weren’t caused by careless smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters\nwho went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires\nraged so fiercely that the fire department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.",

They\nsearched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found not one. Finally they approached one of the\nworld’s outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of\nthis group. “No,” he replied, \"I know what those adults want. But the book they need has never been written.”\n\nI knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself had been searching for years to\ndiscover a practical, working handbook on human relations.\n\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope\nyou like it.\n\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on the subject—everything from\nnewspaper columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the\nnew psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to spend one and a half years in various libraries\nreading everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring over hundreds of\nmagazine articles, searching through countless biographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages\nhad dealt with people. We read their biographies; we read the life stories of all great leaders from Julius Caesar\nto Thomas Edison. I recall that we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were\ndetermined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout\nthe ages for winning friends and influencing people.\n\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them world-famous inventors like\nMarconi and Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen\nD. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford, and explorers like Martin Johnson, and tried to\ndiscover the techniques they used in human relations.\n\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. I\nsay “short.” It was short in the beginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty\nminutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.\n\nI gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their business and social contacts, and then\ncome back to class and speak about their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an interesting\nassignment! These men and women, hungry for self-improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a\nnew kind of laboratory—the first and only laboratory of human relationships for adults that had ever existed.\n\nThis book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and\ndeveloped out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands of adults.\n\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger than a postcard. The next season we\nprinted a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen\nyears of experiment and research came this book.\n\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible\nas it sounds, I have seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives of many people.\n\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses. For years, he had driven and\ncriticized and condemned his employees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of appreciation and\nencouragement were alien to his lips. After studying the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply\naltered his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new\nspirit of teamwork. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he proudly said\nin a speech before the class: “When I used to walk through my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees\nactually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But now they are all my friends and even the\njanitor calls me by my first name.”\n\nThis employer gained more profit, more leisure and—what is infinitely more important—he found far\nmore happiness in his business and in his home.\n\n-----\n\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales by the use of these principles.\nMany have opened up new accounts—accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been\ngiven increased authority, increased pay. One executive reported a large increase in salary because he applied\nthese truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he\nwas sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This training not\nonly saved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion with increased pay.\n\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at the end of the course have told me\nthat their homes have been much happier since their husbands or wives started this training.\n\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases,\nin their enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn’t wait forty-eight\nhours to report their achievements at the regular session of the course.\n\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into the night discussing them with\nother members of the class. At three o’clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so shaken by a\nrealization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a new and richer world opening before him, that he\nwas unable to sleep. He didn’t sleep that night or the next day or the next night.\n\nWho was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any new theory that came along? No, far\nfrom it. He was a sophisticated, blasé dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three languages\nfluently and was a graduate of two European universities.\n\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the old school, an aristocrat whose\nforebears had served for generations as professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written\nfrom a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.\n\nAnother man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet\nfactory, declared he had learned more in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine art of\ninfluencing people than he had learned about the same subject during his four years in college. Absurd?\nLaughable? Fantastic? Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this statement with whatever adjective you wish.\nI am merely reporting, without comment, a declaration made by a conservative and eminently successful\nHarvard graduate in a public address to approximately six hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the\nevening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.\n\n“Compared to what we ought to be,” said the famous Professor William James of Harvard, “compared\nto what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and\nmental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses\npowers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.”\n\nThose powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover,\ndevelop and profit by those dormant and unused assets.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nEven our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast about\nours. La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said, “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want\nfriends, let your friends excel you.”\n\nWhy is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them,\nthey—or at least some of them—will feel inferior and envious.\n\nBy far the best-liked placement counselor in the Mid-town Personnel Agency in New York City was\nHenrietta G ----. It hadn’t always been that way. During the first few months of her association with the agency,\nHenrietta didn’t have a single friend among her colleagues. Why? Because every day she would brag about the\nplacements she had made, the new accounts she had opened, and anything else she had accomplished.\n\n“I was good at my work and proud of it,” Henrietta told one of our classes. “But instead of my\ncolleagues sharing my triumphs, they seemed to resent them. I wanted to be liked by these people. I really\n\n-----\n\nwanted them to be my friends. After listening to some of the suggestions made in this course, I started to talk\nabout myself less and listen more to my associates. They also had things to boast about and were more excited\nabout telling me about their accomplishments than about listening to my boasting. Now, when we have some\ntime to chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and I only mention my achievements when they ask.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 6**\n**_Let the other person do a great deal of the talking._**\n\n-----\n\n## 16\n\n###### “HOW TO GET COOPERATION.”\n\nDon’t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to\nyou on a silver platter? If so, isn’t it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people?\nIsn’t it wiser to make suggestions—and let the other person think out the conclusion?\n\nAdolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile showroom and a student in one of my\ncourses, suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a discouraged and\ndisorganized group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly\nwhat they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the blackboard. He then said, “I’ll give\nyou all these qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to tell me what I have a right to expect from you.”\nThe replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of\nenthusiastic work. The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration—one salesperson volunteered to\nwork fourteen hours a day—and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.\n\n“The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me,” said Mr. Seltz, “and as long as I lived up to\nmy part in it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes and desires was just\nthe shot in the arm they needed.”\n\nNo one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel\nthat we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our\nwants, our thoughts.\n\nTake the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of dollars in commissions before he\nlearned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile\nmanufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in New York once a week, every week for\nthree years. “He never refused to see me,” said Mr. Wesson, “but he never bought. He always looked over my\nsketches very carefully and then said, ‘No, Wesson, I guess we don’t get any today.’”\n\nAfter 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so he resolved to devote one evening a\nweek to the study of influencing human behavior, to help him develop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.\n\nHe decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished artists’ sketches under his arm, he\nrushed over to the buyer’s office. “I want you to do me a little favor, if you will,” he said. “Here are some\nuncompleted sketches. Won’t you please tell me how we could finish them up in such a way that you could use\nthem?”\n\nThe buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word. Finally he said, “Leave these with\nme for a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see me.”\n\nWesson returned three days later, got his suggestions, took the sketches back to the studio and had\nthem finished according to the buyer’s ideas. The result? All accepted.\n\nAfter that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson, all drawn according to the buyer’s\nideas. “I realized why I had failed for years to sell him,” said Mr. Wesson. “I had urged him to buy what I\nthought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach completely. I urged him to give me his ideas. This made\nhim feel that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn’t have to sell him. He bought.”\n\nLetting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and politics, it works\nin family life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this principle:\n\n“My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing vacation trips we have ever taken. I\nhad long dreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall in\n\n-----\n\nPhiladelphia, and our nation’s capital. Valley Forge, Jamestown and the restored colonial village of\nWilliamsburg were high on the list of things I wanted to see.\n\n“In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our summer vacation which included a\ntour of the western states, visiting points of interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had\nwanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn’t obviously make both trips.\n\n“Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U.S. history in junior high school and had become\nvery interested in the events that had shaped our country’s growth. I asked her how she would like to visit the\nplaces she had learned about on our next vacation. She said she would love to.\n\n“Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy announced that if we all agreed, the\nsummer’s vacation would be to the eastern states, that it would he a great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of us.\nWe all concurred.”\n\nThis same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his equipment to one of the largest\nhospitals in Brooklyn This hospital was building an addition and preparing to equip it with the finest X-ray\ndepartment in America. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray department, was overwhelmed with sales\nrepresentatives, each caroling the praises of his own company’s equipment.\n\nOne manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more about handling human nature than\nthe others did. He wrote a letter something like this:\n\n“Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment. The first shipment of these\nmachines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So\nwe should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how\nthey can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send\nmy car for you at any hour you specify.\n\n“I was surprised to get that letter,” Dr. L ---- said as he related the incident before the class. “I was both\nsurprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel\nimportant. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the\nequipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I liked it.",

We are making use of only a small part of our physical and\nmental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses\npowers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.”\n\nThose powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover,\ndevelop and profit by those dormant and unused assets.\n\n“Education,” said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton University, “is the ability to meet\nlife’s situations.”\n\nIf by the time you have finished reading the first three chapters of this book, if you aren’t then a little\nbetter equipped to meet life’s situations, then I shall consider this book to be a total failure so far as you are\nconcerned.\n\n“For the great aim of education,” said Herbert Spencer, “is not knowledge but action.”\n\nAnd this is an action book.\n\n– Dale Carnegie\n1936\n\n-----\n\n###### Nine Suggestions On How To Get The Most Out Of This Book\n\n1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely\nmore important than any rule or technique. Unless you have this one fundamental requisite, a thousand rules\non how to study will avail little, and if you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders\nwithout reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book.\n\nWhat is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to\nincrease your ability to deal with people.\n\nHow can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself how important these principles are to\nyou. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more\nfulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: “My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no\nsmall extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”\n\n2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird’s-eye view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush\non to the next one. But don’t, unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you are reading\nbecause you want to increase your skill in human relations, then go back and reread each chapter\nthoroughly. In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.\n\n3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you\ncan apply each suggestion.\n\n4. Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in your hand. When you come across a\nsuggestion that you feel you can use, draw a line beside it. If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore\nevery sentence or highlight it, or mark it with “****”. Marking and underscoring a book makes it more\ninteresting, and far easier to review rapidly.\n\n5. I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large insurance concern for fifteen years. Every month,\nshe read all the insurance contracts her company had issued that month. Yes, she read many of the same\ncontracts over month after month, year after year. Why? Because experience had taught her that that was\nthe only way she could keep their provisions clearly in mind.\n\nI once spent almost two years writing a book on public speaking and yet I found I had to keep going back\nover it from time to time in order to remember what I had written in my own book. The rapidity with which\nwe forget is astonishing.\n\nSo, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don’t imagine that skimming through it once\nwill suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month. Keep it\non your desk in front of you every day. Glance through it often. Keep constantly impressing yourself with\nthe rich possibilities for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember that the use of these principles\ncan be made habitual only by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and application. There is no\nother way.\n\n6. Bernard Shaw once remarked, “If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.” Shaw was right. Learning\nis an active process. We learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are studying in this\nbook, do something about them. Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don’t you will forget them\nquickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.\n\nYou will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the time. I know because I wrote the book,\nand yet frequently I found it difficult to apply everything I advocated. For example, when you are\ndispleased, it is much easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try to understand the other person’s\nviewpoint. It is frequently easier to find fault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what you\nwant than to talk about what the other person wants and so on. So, as you read this book, remember that you\nare not merely trying to acquire information. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are\nattempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence and daily application.\n\nSo refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook on human relations; and whenever you are\nconfronted with some specific problem—such as handling a child, winning your spouse to your way of\n\n-----\n\nthinking, or satisfying an irritated customer—hesitate about doing the natural thing, the impulsive thing.\nThis is usually wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you have underscored. Then\ntry these new ways and watch them achieve magic for you.\n\n7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches\nyou violating a certain principle. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.\n\n8. The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in a talk before one of my classes, a highly\nefficient system he used for self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had become one\nof the most important financiers in America, and he confessed that he owed most of his success to the\nconstant application of his homemade system. This is what he does and I’ll put it in his own words as\naccurately as I can remember.\n\n“For years I have kept an engagement book showing all the appointments I had during the day. My family\nnever made any plans for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part of each Saturday\nevening to the illuminating process of self-examination and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by\nmyself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the interviews, discussions and meetings that\nhad taken place during the week. I asked myself: ‘What mistakes did I make that time?’ ‘What did I do that\nwas right, and in what way could I have improved my performance?’ ‘What lessons can I learn from that\nexperience?’\n\n“I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was frequently astonished at my own\nblunders. Of course, as the years passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined to\npat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions. This system of self-analysis, self-education,\ncontinued year after year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted.\n\n“It helped me improve my ability to make decisions and it aided me enormously in all my contacts with\npeople. I cannot recommend it too highly.”\n\nWhy not use a similar system to check up on your application of the principles discussed in this book? If\nyou do, two things will result.\n\nFirst, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is both intriguing and priceless. Second,\nyou will find that your ability to meet and deal with people will grow enormously.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nIs this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it? Let’s see, Take Henry G. Duvernoy of Duvemoy\nand Sons, a wholesale baking firm in New York.\n\nMr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York hotel. He had called on the manager\nevery week for four years. He went to the same social affairs the manager attended. He even took rooms in the\nhotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he failed.\n\n“Then,” said Mr. Duvernoy, “after studying human relations, I resolved to change my tactics. I decided\nto find out what interested this man—what caught his enthusiasm.\n\n“I discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called the Hotel Greeters of America. He not\nonly belonged, but his bubbling enthusiasm had made him president of the organization, and president of the\nInternational Greeters. No matter where its conventions were held, he would be there.\n\n“So when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the Greeters. What a response I got. What a\nresponse! He talked to me for half an hour about the Greeters, his tones vibrant with enthusiasm. I could plainly\nsee that this society was not only his hobby; it was the passion of his life. Before I left his office, he had ‘sold’\nme a membership in his organization.\n\n“In the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But a few days later, the steward of his hotel phoned\nme to come over with samples and prices.\n\n“‘I don’t know what you did to the old boy,’ the steward greeted me, ‘but he sure is sold on you!’\n\n“Think of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years—trying to get his business—and I’d still\nbe drumming at him if I hadn’t finally taken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and what he\nenjoyed talking about.”\n\nEdward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose to live in the beautiful Cumberland Valley of\nMaryland after he completed his military service. Unfortunately, at that time there were few jobs available in the\narea. A little research uncovered the fact that a number of companies in the area were either owned or controlled\nby an unusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser, whose rise from poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman.\nHowever, he was known for being inaccessible to job seekers. Mr. Harriman wrote:\n\n“I interviewed a number of people and found that his major interest was anchored in his drive for\npower and money. Since he protected himself from people like me by use of a dedicated and stern secretary, I\nstudied her interests and goals and only then I paid an unannounced visit at her office. She had been Mr.\nFunkhouser’s orbiting satellite for about fifteen years. When I told her I had a proposition for him which might\ntranslate itself into financial and political success for him, she became enthused. I also conversed with her about\nher constructive participation in his success. After this conversation she arranged for me to meet Mr.\nFunkhouser.\n\n“I entered his huge and impressive office determined not to ask directly for a job. He was seated behind\na large carved desk and thundered at me, ‘How about it, young man?’ I said, ‘Mr. Funkhouser, I believe I can\nmake money for you.’ He immediately rose and invited me to sit in one of the large upholstered chairs. I\nenumerated my ideas and the qualifications I had to realize these ideas, as well as how they would contribute to\nhis personal success and that of his businesses.\n\n“‘R. J.’, as he became known to me, hired me at once and for over twenty years I have grown in his\nenterprises and we both have prospered.”\n\nTalking in terms of the other person’s interests pays off for both parties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in\nthe field of employee communications, has always followed this principle. When asked what reward he got from\n\n-----\n\nit, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only received a different reward from each person but that in general the\nreward had been an enlargement of his life each time he spoke to someone.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 5**\n**_Talk in terms of the other person’s interests._**\n\n-----\n\n## 9\n\n###### “HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU INSTANTLY.”\n\nI was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirty-third Street and Eighth Avenue in\nNew York. I noticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the job—weighing envelopes, handing out stamps,\nmaking change, issuing receipts—the same monotonous grind year after year. So I said to myself, “I am going\nto try to make that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself,\nbut about him. So I asked myself, ‘What is there about him that I can honestly admire?’” That is sometimes a\nhard question to answer, especially with strangers; but, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw\nsomething I admired no end.\n\nSo while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm, “I certainly wish I had your head\nof hair.”\n\nHe looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with smiles. “Well, it isn’t as good as it used to be,” he\nsaid modestly. I assured him that although it might have lost some of its pristine glory, nevertheless it was still\nmagnificent. He was immensely pleased. We carried on a pleasant little conversation and the last thing he said\nto me was: “Many people have admired my hair.”\n\nI’ll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I’ll bet he went home that night and told\nhis wife about it. I’ll bet he looked in the mirror and said, “It is a beautiful head of hair.”\n\nI told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards, “What did you want to get out of him?”\n\nWhat was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying to get out of him!!!\n\nIf we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest\nappreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return—if our souls are no bigger than\nsour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve. Oh yes, I did want something out of that\nchap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for him without his\nbeing able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory lung\nafter the incident is past.\n\nThere is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into\ntrouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant\nwe break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel\n_important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in_\nhuman nature; and William James said, “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be\nappreciated.” As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge\nthat has been responsible for civilization itself.\n\nPhilosophers have been speculating on the rules of human relationships for thousands of years, and out\nof all that speculation, there has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as old as history.\nZoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China\ntwenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han.\nBuddha preached it on the bank of the Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books of\nHinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries\nago. Jesus summed it up in one thought—probably the most important rule in the world: “Do unto others as you\nwould have others do unto you.”",

This particular lumber was white pine, and I knew the inspector was\nthoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a competent, experienced inspector on white pine. White pine\nhappened to be my own strong suit, but did I offer any objection to the way he was grading the lumber? None\nwhatever. I kept on watching and gradually began to ask questions as to why certain pieces were not\nsatisfactory. I didn’t for one instant insinuate that the inspector was wrong. I emphasized that my only reason for\nasking was in order that we could give his firm exactly what they wanted in future shipments.\n\n“By asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative spirit, and insisting continually that they were right\nin laying out boards not satisfactory to their purpose, I got him warmed up, and the strained relations between us\nbegan to thaw and melt away. An occasional carefully put remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind\nthat possibly some of these rejected pieces were actually within the grade that they had bought, and that their\nrequirements demanded a more expensive grade. I was very careful, however, not to let him think I was making\nan issue of this point.\n\n“Gradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted to me that he was not experienced on white\npine and began to ask me questions about each piece as it came out of the car, I would explain why such a piece\ncame within the grade specified, but kept on insisting that we did not want him to take it if it was unsuitable for\ntheir purpose. He finally got to the point where he felt guilty every time he put a piece in the rejected pile. And\nat last he saw that the mistake was on their part for not having specified as good a grade as they needed.\n\n“The ultimate outcome was that he went through the entire carload again after I left, accepted the whole\nlot, and we received a check in full.\n\n“In that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination to refrain from telling the other man he\nwas wrong, saved my company a substantial amount of cash, and it would be hard to place a money value on the\ngood will that was saved.”\n\nMartin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he could be an admirer of Air Force General Daniel\n“Chappie” James, then the nation’s highest-ranking black officer. Dr. King replied, “I judge people by their own\nprinciples—not by my own.”\n\nIn a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson\nDavis, in the most glowing terms about a certain officer under his command. Another officer in attendance was\nastonished. “General,” he said, “do you not know that the man of whom you speak so highly is one of your\nbitterest enemies who misses no opportunity to malign you?” “Yes,” replied General Lee, “but the president\nasked my opinion of him; he did not ask for his opinion of me.”\n\nBy the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two thousand years ago, Jesus said:\n“Agree with thine adversary quickly.”\n\nAnd 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice advice that is sorely needed today. “Be diplomatic,” counseled the King. “It will help you gain your point.”\n\nIn other words, don’t argue with your customer or your spouse or your adversary. Don’t tell them they\nare wrong, don’t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You're wrong.”_**\n\n-----\n\n## 12\n\n###### “IF YOU’RE WRONG, ADMIT IT.”\n\nWithin a minute’s walk of my house there was a wild stretch of virgin timber, where the blackberry\nthickets foamed white in the springtime, where the squirrels nested and reared their young, and the horseweeds\ngrew as tall as a horse’s head. This unspoiled woodland was called Forest Park—and it was a forest, probably\nnot much different in appearance from what it was when Columbus discovered America. I frequently walked in\nthis park with Rex, my little Boston bulldog. He was a friendly, harmless little hound; and since we rarely met\nanyone in the park, I took Rex along without a leash or a muzzle.\n\nOne day we encountered a mounted policeman in the park, a policeman itching to show his authority.\n\n“‘What do you mean by letting that dog run loose in the park without a muzzle and leash?” he\nreprimanded me. “Don’t you know it’s against the law?”\n\n“Yes, I know it is,” I replied softy, “but I didn’t think he would do any harm out here.”\n\n“You didn’t think! You didn’t think! The law doesn’t give a tinker’s damn about what you think. That\ndog might kill a squirrel or bite a child. Now, I’m going to let you off this time; but if I catch this dog out here\nagain without a muzzle and a leash, you’ll have to tell it to the judge.”\n\nI meekly promised to obey.\n\nAnd I did obey—for a few times. But Rex didn’t like the muzzle, and neither did I; so we decided to\ntake a chance. Everything was lovely for a while, and then we struck a snag. Rex and I raced over the brow of a\nhill one afternoon and there, suddenly—to my dismay—I saw the majesty of the law, astride a bay horse. Rex\nwas out in front, heading straight for the officer.\n\nI was in for it. I knew it. So I didn’t wait until the policeman started talking. I beat him to it. I said:\n“Officer, you’ve caught me red-handed. I’m guilty. I have no alibis, no excuses. You warned me last week that\nif I brought the dog out here again without a muzzle you would fine me.”\n\n“Well, now,” the policeman responded in a soft tone. “I know it’s a temptation to let a little dog like\nthat have a run out here when nobody is around.”\n\n“Sure it’s a temptation,” I replied, “but it is against the law.”\n\n“Well, a little dog like that isn’t going to harm anybody,” the policeman remonstrated.\n\n“No, but he may kill squirrels,” I said.\n\n“Well now, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously,” he told me. “I’ll tell you what you do. You\njust let him run over the hill there where I can’t see him—and we’ll forget all about it.”\n\nThat policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so when I began to condemn myself,\nthe only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.\n\nBut suppose I had tried to defend myself—well, did you ever argue with a policeman?\n\nBut instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted that he was absolutely right and I was absolutely\nwrong; I admitted it quickly, openly, and with enthusiasm. The affair terminated graciously in my taking his\nside and his taking my side. Lord Chesterfield himself could hardly have been more gracious than this mounted\npoliceman, who, only a week previously, had threatened to have the law on me.\n\n-----\n\nIf we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it\nourselves? Isn’t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips?\n\nSay about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or\nintends to say—and say them before that person has a chance to say them. The chances are a hundred to one that\na generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be minimized just as the mounted policeman\ndid with me and Rex.\n\nFerdinand E. Warren, a commercial artist, used this technique to win the good will of a petulant,\nscolding buyer of art.\n\n“It is important, in making drawings for advertising and publishing purposes, to be precise and very\nexact,” Mr. Warren said as he told the story.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nAnother member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton, New Hampshire, reported how by\nusing a friendly approach, he obtained a very satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.\n\n“Early in the spring,” he reported, “before the ground had thawed from the winter freezing, there was\nan unusually heavy rainstorm and the water, which normally would have run off to nearby ditches and storm\ndrains along the road, took a new course onto a building lot where I had just built a new home.\n\n“Not being able to run off, the water pressure built up around the foundation of the house. The water\nforced itself under the concrete basement floor, causing it to explode, and the basement filled with water. This\nruined the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to repair this damage was in excess of two thousand\ndollars. I had no insurance to cover this type of damage.\n\n“However, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision had neglected to put in a storm drain near\nthe house which could have prevented this problem I made an appointment to see him. During the twenty-fivemile trip to his office, I carefully reviewed the situation and, remembering the principles I learned in this course,\nI decided that showing my anger would not serve any worthwhile purpose, When I arrived, I kept very calm and\nstarted by talking about his recent vacation to the West Indies; then, when I felt the timing was right, I\nmentioned the ‘little’ problem of water damage. He quickly agreed to do his share in helping to correct the\nproblem.\n\n“A few days later he called and said he would pay for the damage and also put in a storm drain to\nprevent the same thing from happening in the future.\n\n“Even though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision, if I had not begun in a friendly way,\nthere would have been a great deal of difficulty in getting him to agree to the total liability.”\n\nYears ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school out in northwest\nMissouri, I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind\n\n-----\n\nsaid, “I’ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you\ncan.”\n\nSo the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew,\nthe tighter the old man clutched his coat to him.\n\nFinally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and\nsmiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind\nthat gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.\n\nThe use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by people who have learned that a\ndrop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. F. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland, proved this\nwhen he had to take his four-month-old car to the service department of the car dealer for the third time. He told\nour class, “It was apparent that talking to, reasoning with or shouting at the service manager was not going to\nlead to a satisfactory resolution of my problems.\n\n“I walked over to the showroom and asked to see the agency owner, Mr. White. After a short wait, I\nwas ushered into Mr. White’s office. I introduced myself and explained to him that I had bought my car from his\ndealership because of the recommendations of friends who had had previous dealings with him. I was told that\nhis prices were very competitive and his service was outstanding. He smiled with satisfaction as he listened to\nme. I then explained the problem I was having with the service department. ‘I thought you might want to be\naware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,’ I added. He thanked me for calling this to his\nattention and assured me that my problem would be taken care of. Not only did he personal get involved, but he\nalso lent me his car to use while mine was being repaired.”\n\nAesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years\nbefore Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as\nthey were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the\nwind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily\nthan all the bluster and storming in the world.\n\nRemember what Lincoln said, “A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**_Begin in a friendly way._**\n\n-----\n\n## 14\n\n###### “THE SECRET OF SOCRATES.”\n\nIn talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by\nemphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that\nyou are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.\n\nGet the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying\n“No.” A “No” response, according to Professor Overstreet,* is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you\nhave said “No,” all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later\nfeel that the “No” was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a\nthing, you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the\naffirmative direction.\n\n- Harry A. Overstreet, lnfluencing Human Behavior (New York: Norton, 1925).\n\nThe skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of “Yes” responses. This sets the psychological\nprocess of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in\none direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back in the opposite direction.\n\nThe psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says “No” and really means it, he or she\nis doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism—glandular, nervous, muscular—\ngathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable\ndegree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself\non guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says “Yes,” none of the withdrawal activities takes\nplace. The organism is in a forward—moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more “Yeses” we can, at the\nvery outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.\n\nIt is a very simple technique—this “yes” response. And yet, how much it is neglected! It often seems as\nif people get a sense of their own importance by antagonizing others at the outset.\n\nGet a student to say “No” at the beginning, or a customer, child, husband, or wife, and it takes the\nwisdom and the patience of angels to transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.\n\nThe use of this “yes, yes” technique enabled James Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings\nBank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.\n\n“This man came in to open an account,” said Mr. Eberson, “and I gave him our usual form to fill out.\nSome of the questions he answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.",

They chopped\nholes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the “cop killer,” with teargas. Then they mounted their\nmachine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New York’s fine residential areas\nreverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an\nover-stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like\nit ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New York.\n\nWhen Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun\ndesperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. “He will kill,”\nsaid the Commissioner, “at the drop of a feather.”\n\nBut how did “Two Gun” Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into\nhis apartment, he wrote a letter addressed “To whom it may concern, ” and, as he wrote, the blood flowing from\nhis wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter Crowley said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a\nkind one—one that would do nobody any harm.”\n\nA short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girlfriend on a country road\nout on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said, “Let me see your license.”\n\nWithout saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As\nthe dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer’s revolver, and fired another bullet into\nthe prostrate body. And that was the killer who said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one—one that\nwould do nobody any harm.’\n\nCrowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he\nsay, “This is what I get for killing people”? No, he said, “This is what I get for defending myself.”\n\nThe point of the story is this: “Two Gun” Crowley didn’t blame himself for anything.\n\nIs that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this:\n\n“I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good\ntime, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.”\n\nThat’s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America’s most notorious Public Enemy—the most sinister gang\nleader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn’t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public\nbenefactor—an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.\n\nAnd so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one\nof New York’s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he\nbelieved it.\n\nI have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York’s\ninfamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that “few of the criminals in Sing\nSing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They\ncan tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of\n\n-----\n\nreasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their anti-social acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly\nmaintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.”\n\nIf Al Capone, “Two Gun” Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison\nwalls don’t blame themselves for anything—what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?\n\nJohn Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed, “I learned thirty years ago\nthat it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact\nthat God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.”\n\nWanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for a third\nof a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize\nthemselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.\n\nCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify\nhimself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and\narouses resentment.\n\nB. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded\nfor good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal\npunished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not\nmake lasting changes and often incur resentment.\n\nHans Selye, another great psychologist, said, “As much as we thirst for approval, we dread\ncondemnation.”\n\nThe resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and\nstill not correct the situation that has been condemned.\n\nGeorge B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company. One of\nhis responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He\nreported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of\nauthority of the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after\nhe left, the workers would remove the hats.\n\nHe decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their\nhard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant\ntone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the\njob. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n- Dr Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.\n\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home. Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I\nall but worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off\nby needless fires. These fires weren’t caused by careless smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters\nwho went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires\nraged so fiercely that the fire department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.\n\nThere was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who started a fire was liable to fine and\nimprisonment, but the sign stood in an unfrequented part of the park, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A\nmounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he didn’t take his duties too seriously, and the fires\ncontinued to spread season after season. On one occasion, I rushed up to a policeman and told him about a fire\nspreading rapidly through the park and wanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied\nthat it was none of his business because it wasn’t in his precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went\n\n-----\n\nriding, I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect the public domain. In the beginning, I am afraid I\ndidn’t even attempt to see the other people’s point of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so\nunhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn\nthem that they could be jailed for starting a fire, order with a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they\nrefused, I would threaten to have them arrested. I was merely unloading my feelings without thinking of their\npoint of view.\n\nThe result? They obeyed…obeyed sullenly and with resentment. After I rode on over the hill, they\nprobably rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park.\n\nWith the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of human relations, a little more tact,\na somewhat greater tendency to see things from the other person’s standpoint. Then, instead of giving orders, I\nwould ride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:\n\n“Having a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for supper? I loved to build fires myself when\nI was a boy, and I still love to. But you know they are very dangerous here in the park. I know you boys don’t\nmean to do any harm, but other boys aren’t so careful. They come along and see that you have built a fire; so\nthey build one and don’t put it out when they go home and it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees.\nWe won’t have any trees here at all if we aren’t more careful. You could be put in jail for building this fire. But\nI don’t want to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure. I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won’t you\nplease rake all the leaves away from the fire right now, and you’ll be careful to cover it with dirt, a lot of dirt,\nbefore you leave, won’t you? And the next time you want to have some fun, won’t you please build your fire\nover the hill there in the sandpit? It can’t do any harm there. Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time.”\n\nWhat a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to cooperate. No sullenness, no\nresentment. They hadn’t been forced to obey orders. They had saved their faces. They felt better and I felt better\nbecause I had handled the situation with consideration for their point of view.\n\nSeeing things through another person’s eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become\noverwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car payment. “On\na Friday,” she reported, \"I received a nasty phone call from the man who was handling my account informing\nme if I did not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate further action from the company. I had\nno way of raising the money over the weekend, so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday\nmorning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked at the situation from his point of view. I\napologized most sincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his most\ntroublesome customer as this was not the first time I was behind in my payments. His tone of voice changed\nimmediately, and he reassured me that I was far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He went on\nto tell me several examples of how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him and often tried to\navoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any\nsuggestion from me, he said it did not matter if I couldn’t pay all the money immediately. It would be all right if\nI paid him $20 by the end of the month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me to do so.”\n\nTomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product or contribute to your favorite\ncharity, why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from another person’s point\nof view? Ask yourself: “Why should he or she want to do it?” True, this will take time, but it will avoid making\nenemies and will get better results, and with less friction and less shoe leather.\n\n“I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview,” said\nDean Donham of the Harvard business school, “than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I\nwas going to say and what that person—from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to\nanswer.”\n\nThat is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the sake of emphasis.\n\n_I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than_\n_step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person—from my_\n_knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to answer._\n\n-----\n\nIf, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing—an increased tendency to think always in\nterms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from that person’s angle as well as your own - if you\nget only that one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping stones of your career.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 8**\n**_Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view._**\n\n-----\n\n## 18\n\n###### “WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS.”\n\nWouldn't you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good\nwill, and make the other person listen attentively?\n\nYes? All right. Here it is: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would\nundoubtedly feel just as you do.”\n\nAn answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive. And you can say that and be 100\npercent sincere, because if you were the other person you, of course, would feel just as he does. Take Al Capone,\nfor example. Suppose you had inherited the same body and temperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose\nyou had had his environment and experiences. You would then be precisely what he was, and where he was. For\nit is those things—and only those things—that made him what he was. The only reason, for example, that you\nare not a rattlesnake is that your mother and father weren’t rattlesnakes.\n\nYou deserve very little credit for being what you are—and remember, the people who come to you\nirritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils.\nPity them. Sympathize with them. Say to yourself, “There, but for the grace of God, go I.”\n\nThree-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to\nthem, and they will love you.",

  "response": "Chapter 17, titled **\"A formula that will work wonders for you,\"** presents a formula for influencing others positively and effectively. Here are the key points discussed in this chapter:\n\n1. **Understanding Human Nature**: The chapter emphasizes the importance of recognizing that people are motivated by their own desires and interests. To influence others, one must understand what they want.\n\n2. **Arousing Eager Wants**: The formula suggests that to persuade someone, you should first identify and arouse in them an eager want. This means framing your request or suggestion in a way that aligns with their interests and desires.\n\n3. **Creating a Win-Win Situation**: The chapter highlights the significance of making the other person feel that they will benefit from the action you want them to take. This creates a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit.\n\n4. **Effective Communication**: It is important to communicate your ideas in a way that resonates with the other person's values and goals. This involves using language and examples that they can relate to.\n\n5. **Empathy and Understanding**: The chapter stresses the need for empathy—putting yourself in the other person's shoes to understand their perspective and motivations.\n\n6. **Practical Application**: The author encourages readers to apply this formula in various situations, whether in personal relationships, business negotiations, or social interactions, to achieve better outcomes.\n\nOverall, this chapter provides a practical approach to influencing others by focusing on their wants and framing requests in a way that highlights mutual benefits.",
