Neither Dale Carnegie nor the publishers, Simon and Schuster, anticipated more than this\nmodest sale. To their amazement, the book became an overnight sensation, and edition after edition rolled off\nthe presses to keep up with the increasing public demand. How to Win Friends and Influence People took its\nplace in publishing history as one of the all-time international bestsellers. It touched a nerve and filled a human\nneed that was more than a faddish phenomenon of post-Depression days, as evidenced by its continued and\nuninterrupted sales into the eighties, almost half a century later.\n\nDale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a million dollars than to put a phrase into the\nEnglish language. How to Win Friends and Influence People became such a phrase, quoted, paraphrased,\nparodied, used in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to novels. The book itself was translated into\nalmost every known written language. Each generation has discovered it anew and has found it relevant.\n\nWhich brings us to the logical question: Why revise a book that has proven and continues to prove its\nvigorous and universal appeal? Why tamper with success?\n\nTo answer that, we must realize that Dale Carnegie himself was a tireless reviser of his own work\nduring his lifetime. How to Win Friends and Influence People was written to be used as a textbook for his\ncourses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations and is still used in those courses today. Until his death in\n1955 he constantly improved and revised the course itself to make it applicable to the evolving needs of an evergrowing public. No one was more sensitive to the changing currents of present-day life than Dale Carnegie. He\nconstantly improved and refined his methods of teaching; he updated his book on Effective Speaking several\ntimes. Had he lived longer, he himself would have revised How to Win Friends and Influence People to better\nreflect the changes that have taken place in the world since the thirties.\n\nMany of the names of prominent people in the book, well known at the time of first publication, are no\nlonger recognized by many of today’s readers. Certain examples and phrases seem as quaint and dated in our\nsocial climate as those in a Victorian novel. The important message and overall impact of the book is weakened\nto that extent.\n\nOur purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify and strengthen the book for a modern reader\nwithout tampering with the content. We have not “changed” How _to Win Friends and Influence People except to_\nmake a few excisions and add a few more contemporary examples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact—\neven the thirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote as he spoke, in an intensively exuberant, colloquial,\nconversational manner.\n\nSo his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the book and in his work. Thousands of people all over\nthe world are being trained in Carnegie courses in increasing numbers each year. And other thousands are\nreading and studying How to Win Friends and lnfluence People and being inspired to use its principles to better\ntheir lives. To all of them, we offer this revision in the spirit of the honing and polishing of a finely made tool.\n\n– Dorothy Carnegie\n(Mrs. Dale Carnegie)\n\n-----\n\n###### How This Book Was Written—And Why\n\nDuring the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the publishing houses of America printed\nmore than a fifth of a million different books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many were financial failures.\n“Many,” did I say? The president of one of the largest publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his\ncompany, after seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost money on seven out of every eight books it\npublished.\n\nWhy, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after I had written it, why should you\nbother to read it?\n\nFair questions, both; and I’ll try to answer them.\n\nI have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for business and professional men and women\nin New York. At first, I conducted courses in public speaking only—courses designed to train adults, by actual\nexperience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise,\nboth in business interviews and before groups.\n\nBut gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective\nspeaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and\nsocial contacts.\n\nI also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of such training myself. As I look back across the\nyears, I am appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a book such as this had\nbeen placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a priceless boon it would have been.\n\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face, especially if you are in business. Yes,\nand that is also true if you are a housewife, architect or engineer. Research done a few years ago under the\nauspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching uncovered a most important and\nsignificant fact—a fact later confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute of Technology.\nThese investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one’s\nfinancial success is due to one’s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering,\nto personality and the ability to lead people.\n\nFor many years, I conducted courses each season at the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia, and also\ncourses for the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of probably more\nthan fifteen hundred engineers have passed through my classes. They came to me because they had finally\nrealized, after years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently\nnot those who know the most about engineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in\nengineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has\ntechnical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among\npeople—that person is headed for higher earning power.\n\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that “the ability to deal with people is as\npurchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay more for that ability,” said John D., “than for any\nother under the sun.”\n\nWouldn’t you suppose that every college in the land would conduct courses to develop the highestpriced ability under the sun? But if there is just one practical, commonsense course of that kind given for adults\nin even one college in the land, it has escaped my attention up to the present writing.\n\nThe University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted a survey to determine what\nadults want to study.\n\nThat survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the survey was made in Meriden,\nConnecticut. It had been chosen as a typical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and\nrequested to answer 156 questions—questions such as “What is your business or profession? Your education?\nHow do you spend your spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions? Your problems?\nWhat subjects are you most interested in studying?” And so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime\n\n-----\n\ninterest of adults and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to\nmake people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.",

They\nsearched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found not one. Finally they approached one of the\nworld’s outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of\nthis group. “No,” he replied, \"I know what those adults want. But the book they need has never been written.”\n\nI knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself had been searching for years to\ndiscover a practical, working handbook on human relations.\n\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope\nyou like it.\n\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on the subject—everything from\nnewspaper columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the\nnew psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to spend one and a half years in various libraries\nreading everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring over hundreds of\nmagazine articles, searching through countless biographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages\nhad dealt with people. We read their biographies; we read the life stories of all great leaders from Julius Caesar\nto Thomas Edison. I recall that we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were\ndetermined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout\nthe ages for winning friends and influencing people.\n\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them world-famous inventors like\nMarconi and Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen\nD. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford, and explorers like Martin Johnson, and tried to\ndiscover the techniques they used in human relations.\n\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. I\nsay “short.” It was short in the beginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty\nminutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.\n\nI gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their business and social contacts, and then\ncome back to class and speak about their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an interesting\nassignment! These men and women, hungry for self-improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a\nnew kind of laboratory—the first and only laboratory of human relationships for adults that had ever existed.\n\nThis book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and\ndeveloped out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands of adults.\n\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger than a postcard. The next season we\nprinted a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen\nyears of experiment and research came this book.\n\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible\nas it sounds, I have seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives of many people.\n\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses. For years, he had driven and\ncriticized and condemned his employees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of appreciation and\nencouragement were alien to his lips. After studying the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply\naltered his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new\nspirit of teamwork. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he proudly said\nin a speech before the class: “When I used to walk through my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees\nactually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But now they are all my friends and even the\njanitor calls me by my first name.”\n\nThis employer gained more profit, more leisure and—what is infinitely more important—he found far\nmore happiness in his business and in his home.\n\n-----\n\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales by the use of these principles.\nMany have opened up new accounts—accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been\ngiven increased authority, increased pay. One executive reported a large increase in salary because he applied\nthese truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he\nwas sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This training not\nonly saved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion with increased pay.\n\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at the end of the course have told me\nthat their homes have been much happier since their husbands or wives started this training.\n\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases,\nin their enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn’t wait forty-eight\nhours to report their achievements at the regular session of the course.\n\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into the night discussing them with\nother members of the class. At three o’clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so shaken by a\nrealization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a new and richer world opening before him, that he\nwas unable to sleep. He didn’t sleep that night or the next day or the next night.\n\nWho was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any new theory that came along? No, far\nfrom it. He was a sophisticated, blasé dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three languages\nfluently and was a graduate of two European universities.\n\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the old school, an aristocrat whose\nforebears had served for generations as professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written\nfrom a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.\n\nAnother man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet\nfactory, declared he had learned more in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine art of\ninfluencing people than he had learned about the same subject during his four years in college. Absurd?\nLaughable? Fantastic? Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this statement with whatever adjective you wish.\nI am merely reporting, without comment, a declaration made by a conservative and eminently successful\nHarvard graduate in a public address to approximately six hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the\nevening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.\n\n“Compared to what we ought to be,” said the famous Professor William James of Harvard, “compared\nto what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and\nmental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses\npowers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.”\n\nThose powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover,\ndevelop and profit by those dormant and unused assets.",

Drifting into the President’s private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his secretaries, “That’s a\npretty dress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very attractive young woman.”\n\nThat was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever bestowed upon a secretary in his life. It\nwas so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, “Now, don’t get\nstuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you would be a little bit more careful with\nyour punctuation.”\n\nHis method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to listen to\nunpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.\n\nA barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what McKinley did back in 1896,\nwhen he was running for President. One of the prominent Republicans of that day had written a campaign\nspeech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster all rolled into one.\nWith great glee, this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley. The speech had its fine points, but it just\nwouldn’t do. It would have raised a tornado of criticism. McKinley didn’t want to hurt the man’s feelings. He\nmust not kill the man’s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say ‘no’. Note how adroitly he did it.\n\n“My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,” McKinley said. “No one could have\nprepared a better one. There are many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say, but is it\nquite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your standpoint, I must consider its\neffect from the party’s standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech along the lines I indicate, and send me\na copy of it.”\n\nHe did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his second speech, and he became one\nof the effective speakers of the campaign.\n\nHere is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was\nwritten to Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln\nprobably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars,\nand that, by the way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard work. The\nletter was written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For\neighteen months, Lincoln’s generals had been leading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another.\nNothing but futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers had deserted from\nthe army, and then the Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the\nWhite House. “We are now on the brink of destruction,” Lincoln said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is\nagainst us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.” Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter came.\n\nI am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to change an obstreperous general\nwhen the very fate of the nation could have depended upon the general’s action.\n\nThis is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became President; yet you will note that\nhe praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave faults.\n\nYes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn’t call them that. Lincoln was more conservative, more\ndiplomatic. Lincoln wrote, “There are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.” Talk\nabout tact! And diplomacy!\n\nHere is the letter addressed to General Hooker:\n\nI have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac.\n\n-----\n\nOf course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for\nyou to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.\n\nI believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix\npolitics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not\nan indispensable quality.\n\nYou are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm, But I think that\nduring General Burnside’s command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as\nmuch as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable\nbrother officer.\n\nI have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the\nGovernment needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you command.\n\nOnly those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you is military\nsuccess and I will risk the dictatorship.\n\nThe Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has\ndone and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the army, of\ncriticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as\nfar as I can, to put it down.\n\nNeither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such spirit\nprevails in it, and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go\nforward and give us victories.\n\nYou are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know whether this philosophy will\noperate for you in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let’s see. Let’s take the case of W. P. Gaw of the Wark\nCompany, Philadelphia.\n\nThe Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large office building in Philadelphia by a\ncertain specified date. Everything was going along well; the building was almost finished, when suddenly the\nsub-contractor making the ornamental bronze work to go on the exterior of this building declared that he\ncouldn’t make delivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All\nbecause of one man!\n\nLong-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent\nto New York to beard the bronze lion in his den.\n\n“Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name?” Mr Gaw asked the president of\nthe subcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced. The president was surprised. “No, I didn’t know\nthat.”\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Gaw, “when I got off the train this morning, I looked in the telephone book to get\nyour address, and you’re the only person in the Brooklyn phone book with your name.”",

He had answered my form letter himself and indicated he could see me that afternoon and\ncould give me ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we talked for over an hour and resolved my problems.\n\n“If I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really wanted to see him, I would probably be still\nwaiting for an appointment.”\n\nJames B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report. His firm had just finished an exhaustive\nstudy for a leading brand of cold cream. Data were needed immediately about the competition in this market; the\nprospective customer was one of the biggest—and most formidable—men in the advertising business.\n\nAnd his first approach failed almost before he began.\n\n“The first time I went in,” Mr. Boynton explains, “I found myself sidetracked into a futile discussion of\nthe methods used in the investigation. He argued and I argued. He told me I was wrong, and I tried to prove that\nI was right.\n\n“I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction—but my time was up, the interview was over, and I\nstill hadn’t produced results.\n\n“The second time, I didn’t bother with tabulations of figures and data. I went to see this man. I\ndramatized my facts.\n\n“As I entered his office, he was busy on the phone. While he finished his conversation, I opened a\nsuitcase and dumped thirty-two jars of cold cream on top of his desk—all products he knew—all competitors of\nhis cream.\n\n“On each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the trade investigation, And each tag told its story\nbriefly, dramatically.\n\n“What happened?\n\n“There was no longer an argument. Here was something new, something different. He picked up first\none and then another of the jars of cold cream and read the information on the tag. A friendly conversation\ndeveloped. He asked additional questions. He was intensely interested. He had originally given me only ten\nminutes to present my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes, forty minutes, and at the end of an hour we\nwere still talking.\n\n-----\n\n“I was presenting the same facts this time that I had presented previously. But this time I was using\ndramatization, showmanship—and what a difference it made.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 11**\n**_Dramatize your ideas._**\n\n-----\n\n## 21\n\n###### “WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS, TRY THIS.”\n\nCharles Schwab had a mill manager whose people weren’t producing their quota of work.\n\n“How is it,” Schwab asked him, “that a manager as capable as you can’t make this mill turn out what it\nshould?”\n\n“I don’t know,” the manager replied. “I’ve coaxed the men, I’ve pushed them, I’ve sworn and cussed,\nI’ve threatened them with damnation and being fired. But nothing works. They just won’t produce.”\n\nThis conversation took place at the end of the day, just before the night shift came on. Schwab asked\nthe manager for a piece of chalk, then, turning to the nearest man, asked, “How many heats did your shift make\ntoday?”\n\n“Six.”\n\nWithout another word, Schwab chalked a big figure six on the floor, and walked away.\n\nWhen the night shift came in, they saw the “6” and asked what it meant.\n\n“The big boss was in here today,” the day people said. “He asked us how many heats we made, and we\ntold him six. He chalked it down on the floor.”\n\nThe next morning Schwab walked through the mill again. The night shift had rubbed out “6” and\nreplaced it with a big “7.”\n\nWhen the day shift reported for work the next morning, they saw a big “7” chalked on the floor. So the\nnight shift thought they were better than the day shift did they? Well, they would show the night shift a thing or\ntwo. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when they quit that night, they left behind them an enormous,\nswaggering “10”. Things were stepping up.\n\nShortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind in production, was turning out more work than\nany other mill in the plant.\n\nThe principle?\n\nLet Charles Schwab say it in his own words: “The way to get things done,” say Schwab, “is to\nstimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.”\n\nThe desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing to\npeople of spirit.\n\nWithout a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never have been President of the United States. The\nRough Rider, just back from Cuba, was picked for governor of New York State. The opposition discovered he\nwas no longer a legal resident of the state, and Roosevelt, frightened, wished to withdraw. Then Thomas Collier\nPlatt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the challenge. Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt,\nhe cried in a ringing voice, “Is the hero of San Juan Hill a coward?”\n\nRoosevelt stayed in the fight—and the rest is history. A challenge not only changed his life; it had a\nreal effect upon the future of his nation.\n\n“All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always\nto victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in ancient Greece. What greater challenge can be offered than the\nopportunity to overcome those fears?\n\n-----\n\nWhen Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up against it. Sing Sing, at the time the most\nnotorious penitentiary west of Devil's Island, was without a warden. Scandals had been sweeping through the\npristin walls, scandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong man to rule Sing Sing—an iron man. But who?\nHe sent for Lewis E. Lawes of New Hampton.\n\n“How about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?” he said jovially when Lawes stood before him.\n“They need a man up there with experience.”\n\nLawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of Sing Sing. It was a political appointment, subject to\nthe vagaries of political whims. Wardens had come and gone—one had lasted only three weeks. He had a career\nto consider. Was it worth the risk?\n\nThen Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in his chair and smiled. “Young fellow,” he said, “I\ndon’t blame you for being scared. It’s a tough spot. It’ll take a big person to go up there and stay.”\n\nSo Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he? Lawes liked the idea of attempting a job that called\nfor someone “big”.\n\nSo he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the most famous warden of his time. His book 20,000\n_Years in Sing Sing sold into the hundred of thousands of copies. His broadcasts on the air and his stories of_\nprison life have inspired dozens of movies. His “humanizing” of criminals wrought miracles in the way of\nprison reform.\n\n“I have never found,” said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great Firestone Tire and Rubber\nCompany, “that pay and pay alone would either bring together or hold good people. I think it was the game\nitself.”\n\nFrederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists, concurred. He studied in depth the work\nattitudes of thousands of people ranging from factory workers to senior executives. What do you think he found\nto be the most motivating factor—the one facet of the jobs that was most stimulating? Money? Good working\nconditions? Fringe benefits? No, not any of those. The one major factor that motivated people was the work\nitself. If the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a\ngood job.\n\nThat is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance to\nprove his or her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-races and hog-calling and pie-eating contests.\nThe desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 12**\n**_Throw down a challenge._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**HOW TO WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Show respect for the other person's opinions.

Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This_\nonly raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding.\n\n_Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and_\nareas on which you agree.\n\n_Be honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will_\nhelp disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness.\n\n_Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents_\nmay be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and\nfind yourself in a position where your opponents can say, “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.”\n\n_Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is_\ninterested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn\nyour opponents into friends.\n\n_Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be_\nheld later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask\nyourself some hard questions:\n\nCould my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my\nreaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my\nopponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of\nme? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow\nover? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?\n\n- Bits and Pieces, published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J.\n\n-----\n\nOpera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said, “My wife and I made a pact\na long time ago, and we’ve kept it no matter how angry we’ve grown with each other. When one yells, the other\nshould listen, because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it._**\n\n-----\n\n## 11\n\n###### “A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIES—AND HOW TO AVOID IT.”\n\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed that if he could be right 75 percent of\nthe time, he would reach the highest measure of his expectation.\n\nIf that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men of the twentieth century could\nhope to obtain, what about you and me?\n\nIf you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make\na million dollars a day. If you can’t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other\npeople they are wrong?\n\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can\nin words—and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have\nstruck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike\nback. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato\nor an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.\n\nNever begin by announcing “I am going to prove so-and-so to you.” That’s bad. That’s tantamount to\nsaying, “I’m smarter than you are, I’m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.”\n\nThat is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before you\neven start.\n\nIt is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change people’s minds. So why make it\nharder? Why handicap yourself?\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one\nwill feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you\ntaught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot.\n\nOver three hundred years ago Galileo said, “You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him\nto find it within himself.”\n\nAs Lord Chesterfield said to his son, “Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.”\n\nSocrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens, “One thing only I know, and that is that I know\nnothing.”\n\nWell, I can’t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling people they are wrong. And I\nfind that it pays.\n\nIf a person makes a statement that you think is wrong—yes, even that you know is wrong—isn’t it\nbetter to begin by saying, “Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I\nam wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\nThere’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as, “I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the\nfacts.”\n\nNobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to\nyour saying, “I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\n-----\n\nOne of our class members who used this approach in dealing with customers was Harold Reinke, a\nDodge dealer in Billings, Montana. He reported that because of the pressures of the automobile business, he was\noften hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers’ complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of\nbusiness and general unpleasantness.\n\nHe told his class, “Recognizing that this was getting me nowhere fast, I tried a new tack. I would say\nsomething like this, ‘Our dealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently ashamed. We may have\nerred in your case. Tell me about it.’\n\n“This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the customer releases his feelings, he is\nusually much more reasonable when it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers have thanked me\nfor having such an understanding attitude. And two of them have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In\nthis highly competitive market, we need more of this type of customer, and I believe that showing respect for all\ncustomers’ opinions and treating them diplomatically and courteously will help beat the competition.”\n\nYou will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and\ninspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit\nthat he, too, may be wrong.\n\nIf you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell him or her so, what happens? Let me\nillustrate. Mr. S---- a young New York attorney, once argued a rather important case before the United States\nSupreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280 U.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of money\nand an important question of law. During the argument, one of the Supreme Court justices said to him, “The\nstatute of limitations in admiralty law is six years, is it not?”\n\nMr. S---- stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment, and then said bluntly, “Your Honor, there is no\nstatute of limitations in admiralty.”\n\n“A hush fell on the court,” said Mr. S---- as he related his experience to one of the author’s classes,\n“and the temperature in the room seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice—was wrong. And I had told him\nso. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke\nbetter than I ever spoke before. But I didn’t persuade. I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and\nfamous man that he was wrong.”",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nIt was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued\nwith my brother about everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied logic and\nargumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk about being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be\nshown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to\nwrite a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of\narguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to\nget the best of an argument—and that is to avoid it.\n\nAvoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.\n\nNine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever\nthat he is absolutely right.\n\nYou can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it.\nWhy? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is\n_non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You_\nhave hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And…\n\n_A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still._\n\nYears ago Patrick J. O’Haire joined one of my classes. He had had little education, and how he loved a\nscrap! He had once been a chauffeur, and he came to me because he had been trying, without much success, to\nsell trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he was continually scrapping with and antagonizing the\n\n-----\n\nvery people he was trying to do business with. If a prospect said anything derogatory about the trucks he was\nselling, Pat saw red and was right at the customer’s throat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those days. As he said\nto me afterward, “I often walked out of an office saying, ‘I told that bird something.’ Sure I had told him\nsomething, but I hadn’t sold him anything.”\n\nMv first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O’Haire to talk. My immediate task was to train him to\nrefrain from talking and to avoid verbal fights.\n\nMr. O’Haire became one of the star salesmen for the White Motor Company in New York. How did he\ndo it? Here is his story in his own words: “If I walk into a buyer’s office now and he says, ‘What? A White\ntruck? They’re no good! I wouldn’t take one if you gave it to me. I’m going to buy the Whose-It truck,’ I say,\n‘The Whose-It is a good truck. If you buy the Whose-It, you’ll never make a mistake. The Whose-Its are made\nby a fine company and sold by good people.’\n\n“He is speechless then. There is no room for an argument. If he says the Whose-It is best and I say sure\nit is, he has to stop. He can’t keep on all afternoon saying, ‘It’s the best’ when I’m agreeing with him. We then\nget off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the good points of the White truck.\n\n“There was a time when a remark like his first one would have made me see scarlet and red and orange.\nI would start arguing against the Whose-It; and the more I argued against it, the more my prospect argued in\nfavor of it; and the more he argued, the more he sold himself on my competitor’s product.\n\n“As I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to sell anything. I lost years of my life in scrapping\nand arguing. I keep my mouth shut now. It pays.”\n\nAs wise old Ben Franklin used to say: If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a\nvictory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s goodwill.\n\nSo figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical victory or a person’s\ngood will? You can seldom have both.\n\nThe Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant doggerel:\n\nHere lies the body of William Jay, .\nWho died maintaining his right of way—\nHe was right, dead right, as he sped along,\nBut he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.\n\nYou may be right, dead right, as you speed along in your argument; but as far as changing another’s\nmind is concerned, you will probably be just as futile as if you were wrong.\n\nFrederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had been disputing and wrangling for an hour with a\ngovernment tax inspector. An item of nine thousand dollars was at stake. Mr. Parsons claimed that this nine\nthousand dollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would never be collected, that it ought not to be taxed. “Bad\ndebt, my eye!” retorted the inspector. “It must be taxed.”\n\n“This inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn,” Mr. Parsons said as he told the story to the class.\n“Reason was wasted and so were facts…The longer we argued, the more stubborn he became. So I decided to\navoid argument, change the subject, and give him appreciation.\n\n“I said, ‘I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison with the really important and difficult\ndecisions you’re required to make. I’ve made a study of taxation myself. But I’ve had to get my knowledge from\nbooks. You are getting yours from the firing line of experience. I sometime wish I had a job like yours. It would\nteach me a lot.’ I meant every word I said.\n\n“Well.” The inspector straightened up in his chair, leaned back, and talked for a long time about his\nwork, telling me of the clever frauds he had uncovered. His tone gradually became friendly, and presently he\nwas telling me about his children. As he left, he advised me that he would consider my problem further and give\nme his decision in a few days.\n\n-----\n\n“He called at my office three days later and informed me that he had decided to leave the tax return\nexactly as it was filed.”\n\nThis tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of human frailties. He wanted a feeling\nof importance; and as long as Mr. Parsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting\nhis authority. But as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to\nexpand his ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.\n\nBuddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,” and a misunderstanding is never ended by\nan argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.\n\nLincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for indulging in a violent controversy with an\nassociate. “No man who is resolved to make the most of himself,” said Lincoln, “can spare time for personal\ncontention. Still less can he afford to take the consequences, including the vitiation of his temper and the loss of\nself-control. Yield larger things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield lesser ones though\nclearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing\nthe dog would not cure the bite.”\n\nIn an article in Bits and Pieces*, some suggestions are made on how to keep a disagreement from\nbecoming an argument:\n\nWelcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, “When two partners always agree, one of them is\nnot necessary.” If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention.\nPerhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake.\n\n_Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be_\ndefensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your\nbest.\n\n_Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her_\nangry.\n\n_Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This_\nonly raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding.",

It was selected for me by a friend who specializes in\nfine woods.”\n\nThen Eastman showed him about the room, commenting on the proportions, the coloring, the hand\ncarving and other effects he had helped to plan and execute.\n\nWhile drifting about the room, admiring the woodwork, they paused before a window, and George\nEastman, in his modest, soft-spoken way, pointed out some of the institutions through which he was trying to\nhelp humanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital, the Homeopathic Hospital, the Friendly\nHome, the Children’s Hospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated him warmly on the idealistic way he was using his\nwealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. Presently, George Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulled out\nthe first camera he had ever owned—an invention he had bought from an Englishman.\n\nAdamson questioned him at length about his early struggles to get started in business, and Mr. Eastman\nspoke with real feeling about the poverty of his childhood, telling how his widowed mother had kept a\nboardinghouse while he clerked in an insurance office. The terror of poverty haunted him day and night, and he\nresolved to make enough money so that his mother wouldn’t have to work, Mr. Adamson drew him out with\nfurther questions and listened, absorbed, while he related the story of his experiments with dry photographic\nplates. He told how he had worked in an office all day, and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief\nnaps while the chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two hours at\na stretch.\n\nJames Adamson had been ushered into Eastman’s office at ten-fifteen and had been warned that he\nmust not take more than five minutes; but an hour had passed, then two hours passed. And they were still\ntalking. Finally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said, “The last time I was in Japan I bought some\nchairs, brought them home, and put them in my sun porch. But the sun peeled the paint, so I went downtown the\nother day and bought some paint and painted the chairs myself. Would you like to see what sort of a job I can do\npainting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have lunch with me and I’ll show you.”\n\nAfter lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had brought from Japan. They weren’t worth\nmore than a few dollars, but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them because he himself\nhad painted them.\n\nThe order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do you suppose got the order—James Adamson or\none of his competitors?\n\n-----\n\nFrom the time of this story until Mr. Eastman’s death, he and James Adamson were close friends.\n\nClaude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France, used this principle and saved his restaurant the\nloss of a key employee. This woman had been in his employ for five years and was a vital link between M.\nMarais and his staff of twenty-one people. He was shocked to receive a registered letter from her advising him\nof her resignation.\n\nM. Marais reported, “I was very surprised and, even more, disappointed, because I was under the\nimpression that I had been fair to her and receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend as well as an\nemployee, I probably had taken her too much for granted and maybe was even more demanding of her than of\nother employees.\n\n“I could not, of course, accept this resignation without some explanation. I took her aside and said,\n‘Paulette, you must understand that I cannot accept your resignation. You mean a great deal to me and to this\ncompany, and you are as important to the success of this restaurant as I am.’ I repeated this in front of the entire\nstaff, and I invited her to my home and reiterated my confidence in her with my family present.\n\n“Paulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as never before. I frequently reinforce\nthis by expressing my appreciation for what she does and showing her how important she is to me and to the\nrestaurant.”\n\n“Talk to people about themselves,” said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British\nEmpire. “Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 6**\n**_Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_Become genuinely interested in other people._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n\n**_Smile._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**_Be a good listener.

I was\nmanager at the time for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace out in Palestine;\nand shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the world by flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such\nfeat had ever been attempted before. It created a tremendous sensation. The Australian government awarded him\nfifty thousand dollars; the King of England knighted him; and, for a while, he was the most talked-about man\nunder the Union Jack. I was attending a banquet one night given in Sir Ross’s honor; and during the dinner, the\nman sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation “There’s a divinity that shapes our\nends, rough-hew them how we will.”\n\nThe raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He was wrong. I knew that, I knew it\npositively. There couldn’t be the slightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and display my\nsuperiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee of one to correct him. He stuck to\nhis guns. What? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it.\n\nThe storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank Gammond, an old friend of mine, was seated at my\nleft. Mr. Gammond had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare, So the storyteller and I agreed to submit the\nquestion to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked me under the table, and then said: “Dale, you are\nwrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.”\n\nOn our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond, “Frank, you knew that quotation was from\nShakespeare,”\n\n“Yes, of course,” he replied, “Hamlet, Act Five, Scene Two. But we were guests at a festive occasion,\nmy dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his\nface? He didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle.”\nThe man who said that taught me a lesson I’ll never forget. I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable,\nbut had put my friend in an embarrassing situation. How much better it would have been had I not become\nargumentative.\n\nIt was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued\nwith my brother about everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied logic and\nargumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk about being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be\nshown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to\nwrite a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of\narguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to\nget the best of an argument—and that is to avoid it.\n\nAvoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.",

You did it.”\n\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t want him to do it—none of these\nthings kept the bed dry. So the parents asked, “How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”\n\nWhat were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like\nGrandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a\npair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object.\n\nHis mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said, “Here is a\nlittle gentleman who would like to do some shopping.”\n\nThe salesgirl made him feel important by saying, “Young man, what can I show you?”\n\nHe stood a couple of inches taller and said, “I want to buy a bed for myself.”\n\nWhen he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was\npersuaded to buy it.\n\nThe bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to the\ndoor shouting, “Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!”\n\nThe father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab’s injunction: he was “hearty in his approbation\nand lavish in his praise.”\n\n“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father said. “Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this\nbed.” The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it.\nAnd he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.\n\nAnother father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn’t get his threeyear-old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility.\nSo the parents asked themselves, “How can we make her want to do it?”\n\nThe little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a\nchair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen\nwhile she was stirring the cereal and she said, “Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.”\n\nShe ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She had\nachieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.\n\nWilliam Winter once remarked that “self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why\ncan’t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making\n\n-----\n\nothers think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own;\nthey will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.\n\nRemember: “First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world\nwith him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.\"\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Arouse in the other person an eager want._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_Don’t criticize, condemn or complain._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Give honest and sincere appreciation._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Arouse in the other person an eager want._**\n\n-----\n\n# PART TWO\n\n### Six Ways To Make People Like You\n\n-----\n\n## 4\n\n###### “DO THIS AND YOU’LL BE WELCOME ANYWHERE.”\n\nWhy read this book to find out how to win friends? Why not study the technique of the greatest winner\nof friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When\nyou get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of\nhis skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there\nare no ulterior motives: he doesn’t want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn’t want to marry you.\n\nDid you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn’t have to work for a living? A hen\nhas to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you\nnothing but love.\n\nWhen I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired pup for fifty cents. He was the light\nand joy of my childhood. Every afternoon about four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes\nstaring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through the\nbuck brush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of sheer\necstasy.\n\nTippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic night—I shall never forget it—he\nwas killed within ten feet of my head, killed by lightning. Tippy’s death was the tragedy of my boyhood.\n\nYou never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn’t need to. You knew by some divine instinct\nthat you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in\ntwo years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that. You can make more friends in two\nmonths by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested\nin you.\n\nYet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into\nbecoming interested in them.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are\ninterested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.\n\nThe New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out\nwhich word is the most frequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun “I.” “I.” “I.” It was used\n3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. “I.” “I.” “I.” “I.” When you see a group photograph that you are in,\nwhose picture do you look for first?\n\nIf we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true,\nsincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.\n\nNapoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said, “Josephine, I have been as fortunate\nas any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can\nrely.” And historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.\n\nAlfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book entitled What Life Should Mean to You.\nIn that book he says, “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties\nin life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures\nspring.”\n\nYou may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming across a statement more\nsignificant for you and for me. Adler’s statement is so rich with meaning that I am going to repeat it in italics: It\n_is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the_\n_greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring._\n\n-----\n\nI once took a course in short-story writing at New York University, and during that course the editor of\na leading magazine talked to our class. He said he could pick up any one of the dozens of stories that drifted\nacross his desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he could feel whether or not the author liked\npeople. “If the author doesn’t like people,” he said, “people won’t like his or her stories.”\n\nThis hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on fiction writing and apologized for\npreaching a sermon. “I am telling you,” he said, “the same things your preacher would tell you, but remember,\nyou have to be interested in people if you want to be a successful writer of stories.”\n\nIf that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing with people face-to-face.",

We are making use of only a small part of our physical and\nmental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses\npowers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.”\n\nThose powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover,\ndevelop and profit by those dormant and unused assets.\n\n“Education,” said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton University, “is the ability to meet\nlife’s situations.”\n\nIf by the time you have finished reading the first three chapters of this book, if you aren’t then a little\nbetter equipped to meet life’s situations, then I shall consider this book to be a total failure so far as you are\nconcerned.\n\n“For the great aim of education,” said Herbert Spencer, “is not knowledge but action.”\n\nAnd this is an action book.\n\n– Dale Carnegie\n1936\n\n-----\n\n###### Nine Suggestions On How To Get The Most Out Of This Book\n\n1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely\nmore important than any rule or technique. Unless you have this one fundamental requisite, a thousand rules\non how to study will avail little, and if you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders\nwithout reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book.\n\nWhat is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to\nincrease your ability to deal with people.\n\nHow can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself how important these principles are to\nyou. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more\nfulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: “My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no\nsmall extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”\n\n2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird’s-eye view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush\non to the next one. But don’t, unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you are reading\nbecause you want to increase your skill in human relations, then go back and reread each chapter\nthoroughly. In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.\n\n3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you\ncan apply each suggestion.\n\n4. Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in your hand. When you come across a\nsuggestion that you feel you can use, draw a line beside it. If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore\nevery sentence or highlight it, or mark it with “****”. Marking and underscoring a book makes it more\ninteresting, and far easier to review rapidly.\n\n5. I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large insurance concern for fifteen years. Every month,\nshe read all the insurance contracts her company had issued that month. Yes, she read many of the same\ncontracts over month after month, year after year. Why? Because experience had taught her that that was\nthe only way she could keep their provisions clearly in mind.\n\nI once spent almost two years writing a book on public speaking and yet I found I had to keep going back\nover it from time to time in order to remember what I had written in my own book. The rapidity with which\nwe forget is astonishing.\n\nSo, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don’t imagine that skimming through it once\nwill suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month. Keep it\non your desk in front of you every day. Glance through it often. Keep constantly impressing yourself with\nthe rich possibilities for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember that the use of these principles\ncan be made habitual only by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and application. There is no\nother way.\n\n6. Bernard Shaw once remarked, “If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.” Shaw was right. Learning\nis an active process. We learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are studying in this\nbook, do something about them. Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don’t you will forget them\nquickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.\n\nYou will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the time. I know because I wrote the book,\nand yet frequently I found it difficult to apply everything I advocated. For example, when you are\ndispleased, it is much easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try to understand the other person’s\nviewpoint. It is frequently easier to find fault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what you\nwant than to talk about what the other person wants and so on. So, as you read this book, remember that you\nare not merely trying to acquire information. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are\nattempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence and daily application.\n\nSo refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook on human relations; and whenever you are\nconfronted with some specific problem—such as handling a child, winning your spouse to your way of\n\n-----\n\nthinking, or satisfying an irritated customer—hesitate about doing the natural thing, the impulsive thing.\nThis is usually wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you have underscored. Then\ntry these new ways and watch them achieve magic for you.\n\n7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches\nyou violating a certain principle. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.\n\n8. The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in a talk before one of my classes, a highly\nefficient system he used for self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had become one\nof the most important financiers in America, and he confessed that he owed most of his success to the\nconstant application of his homemade system. This is what he does and I’ll put it in his own words as\naccurately as I can remember.\n\n“For years I have kept an engagement book showing all the appointments I had during the day. My family\nnever made any plans for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part of each Saturday\nevening to the illuminating process of self-examination and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by\nmyself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the interviews, discussions and meetings that\nhad taken place during the week. I asked myself: ‘What mistakes did I make that time?’ ‘What did I do that\nwas right, and in what way could I have improved my performance?’ ‘What lessons can I learn from that\nexperience?’\n\n“I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was frequently astonished at my own\nblunders. Of course, as the years passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined to\npat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions. This system of self-analysis, self-education,\ncontinued year after year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted.\n\n“It helped me improve my ability to make decisions and it aided me enormously in all my contacts with\npeople. I cannot recommend it too highly.”\n\nWhy not use a similar system to check up on your application of the principles discussed in this book? If\nyou do, two things will result.\n\nFirst, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is both intriguing and priceless. Second,\nyou will find that your ability to meet and deal with people will grow enormously.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n-----\n\nI knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations extended by friends, invitations\ncoming from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least\ncontented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and toothis and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it,\nhe suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about\nthe refusal, He immediately changed the other person’s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the\ninvitation.\n\nGunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an employee in the food store he\nmanaged who was negligent about putting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were displayed.\nThis caused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders, admonitions, confrontations, with her about this\ndid not do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his office and told her he was appointing her\nSupervisor of Price Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the shelves\nproperly tagged. This new responsibility and title changed her attitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties\nsatisfactorily from then on.\n\nChildish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he created the Legion of Honor and\ndistributed 15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made eighteen of his generals “Marshals of France” and called his\ntroops the “Grand Army.” Napoleon was criticized for giving “toys” to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon\nreplied, “Men are ruled by toys.”\n\nThis technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and it will work for you. For\nexample, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running across and\ndestroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither worked. Then she tried giving the worst\nsinner in the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him her “detective” and put him in charge of\nkeeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her problem. Her “detective” built a bonfire in the backyard,\nheated an iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the lawn.\n\nThe effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change\nattitudes or behavior:\n\n1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and\nconcentrate on the benefits to the other person.\n\n2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.\n\n3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.\n\n4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.\n\n5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.\n\n_6._ When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he\npersonally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: “John, we have customers coming in tomorrow\nand I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish\nthe counter.” Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the\ntask: “John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it\n_later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the_\nstockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and\npolish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good\n_company image.”_\n\nWill John be happy about doing what you suggest? Probably not very happy, but happier than if you\nhad not pointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is\ninterested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been\npointed out to John that the job would have to be done eventually and by doing it now, he won’t be faced with it\nlater.\n\nIt is naive to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these\napproaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this way than\n\n-----\n\nby not using these principles—and if you increase your successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become\n10 percent more effective as a leader than you were before—and that is your benefit.\n\nPeople are more likely to do what you would like them to do when you use…\n\n**PRINCIPLE 9**\n**_Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**BE A LEADER**\n\n**A leader’s job often includes changing your people’s attitudes and behavior.

They chopped\nholes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the “cop killer,” with teargas. Then they mounted their\nmachine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New York’s fine residential areas\nreverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an\nover-stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like\nit ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New York.\n\nWhen Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun\ndesperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. “He will kill,”\nsaid the Commissioner, “at the drop of a feather.”\n\nBut how did “Two Gun” Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into\nhis apartment, he wrote a letter addressed “To whom it may concern, ” and, as he wrote, the blood flowing from\nhis wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter Crowley said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a\nkind one—one that would do nobody any harm.”\n\nA short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girlfriend on a country road\nout on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said, “Let me see your license.”\n\nWithout saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As\nthe dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer’s revolver, and fired another bullet into\nthe prostrate body. And that was the killer who said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one—one that\nwould do nobody any harm.’\n\nCrowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he\nsay, “This is what I get for killing people”? No, he said, “This is what I get for defending myself.”\n\nThe point of the story is this: “Two Gun” Crowley didn’t blame himself for anything.\n\nIs that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this:\n\n“I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good\ntime, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.”\n\nThat’s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America’s most notorious Public Enemy—the most sinister gang\nleader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn’t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public\nbenefactor—an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.\n\nAnd so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one\nof New York’s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he\nbelieved it.\n\nI have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York’s\ninfamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that “few of the criminals in Sing\nSing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They\ncan tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of\n\n-----\n\nreasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their anti-social acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly\nmaintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.”\n\nIf Al Capone, “Two Gun” Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison\nwalls don’t blame themselves for anything—what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?\n\nJohn Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed, “I learned thirty years ago\nthat it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact\nthat God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.”\n\nWanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for a third\nof a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize\nthemselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.\n\nCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify\nhimself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and\narouses resentment.\n\nB. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded\nfor good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal\npunished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not\nmake lasting changes and often incur resentment.\n\nHans Selye, another great psychologist, said, “As much as we thirst for approval, we dread\ncondemnation.”\n\nThe resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and\nstill not correct the situation that has been condemned.\n\nGeorge B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company. One of\nhis responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He\nreported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of\nauthority of the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after\nhe left, the workers would remove the hats.\n\nHe decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their\nhard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant\ntone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the\njob. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n- Dr Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.\n\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home. Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I\nall but worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off\nby needless fires. These fires weren’t caused by careless smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters\nwho went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires\nraged so fiercely that the fire department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.\n\nThere was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who started a fire was liable to fine and\nimprisonment, but the sign stood in an unfrequented part of the park, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A\nmounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he didn’t take his duties too seriously, and the fires\ncontinued to spread season after season. On one occasion, I rushed up to a policeman and told him about a fire\nspreading rapidly through the park and wanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied\nthat it was none of his business because it wasn’t in his precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went\n\n-----\n\nriding, I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect the public domain. In the beginning, I am afraid I\ndidn’t even attempt to see the other people’s point of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so\nunhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn\nthem that they could be jailed for starting a fire, order with a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they\nrefused, I would threaten to have them arrested. I was merely unloading my feelings without thinking of their\npoint of view.\n\nThe result? They obeyed…obeyed sullenly and with resentment. After I rode on over the hill, they\nprobably rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park.\n\nWith the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of human relations, a little more tact,\na somewhat greater tendency to see things from the other person’s standpoint. Then, instead of giving orders, I\nwould ride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:\n\n“Having a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for supper? I loved to build fires myself when\nI was a boy, and I still love to. But you know they are very dangerous here in the park. I know you boys don’t\nmean to do any harm, but other boys aren’t so careful. They come along and see that you have built a fire; so\nthey build one and don’t put it out when they go home and it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees.\nWe won’t have any trees here at all if we aren’t more careful. You could be put in jail for building this fire. But\nI don’t want to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure. I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won’t you\nplease rake all the leaves away from the fire right now, and you’ll be careful to cover it with dirt, a lot of dirt,\nbefore you leave, won’t you? And the next time you want to have some fun, won’t you please build your fire\nover the hill there in the sandpit? It can’t do any harm there. Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time.”\n\nWhat a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to cooperate. No sullenness, no\nresentment. They hadn’t been forced to obey orders. They had saved their faces. They felt better and I felt better\nbecause I had handled the situation with consideration for their point of view.\n\nSeeing things through another person’s eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become\noverwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car payment. “On\na Friday,” she reported, \"I received a nasty phone call from the man who was handling my account informing\nme if I did not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate further action from the company. I had\nno way of raising the money over the weekend, so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday\nmorning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked at the situation from his point of view. I\napologized most sincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his most\ntroublesome customer as this was not the first time I was behind in my payments. His tone of voice changed\nimmediately, and he reassured me that I was far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He went on\nto tell me several examples of how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him and often tried to\navoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any\nsuggestion from me, he said it did not matter if I couldn’t pay all the money immediately. It would be all right if\nI paid him $20 by the end of the month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me to do so.”\n\nTomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product or contribute to your favorite\ncharity, why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from another person’s point\nof view? Ask yourself: “Why should he or she want to do it?” True, this will take time, but it will avoid making\nenemies and will get better results, and with less friction and less shoe leather.\n\n“I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview,” said\nDean Donham of the Harvard business school, “than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I\nwas going to say and what that person—from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to\nanswer.”\n\nThat is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the sake of emphasis.\n\n_I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than_\n_step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person—from my_\n_knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to answer._\n\n-----\n\nIf, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing—an increased tendency to think always in\nterms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from that person’s angle as well as your own - if you\nget only that one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping stones of your career.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 8**\n**_Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view._**\n\n-----\n\n## 18\n\n###### “WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS.”\n\nWouldn't you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good\nwill, and make the other person listen attentively?\n\nYes? All right. Here it is: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would\nundoubtedly feel just as you do.”\n\nAn answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive. And you can say that and be 100\npercent sincere, because if you were the other person you, of course, would feel just as he does. Take Al Capone,\nfor example. Suppose you had inherited the same body and temperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose\nyou had had his environment and experiences. You would then be precisely what he was, and where he was. For\nit is those things—and only those things—that made him what he was. The only reason, for example, that you\nare not a rattlesnake is that your mother and father weren’t rattlesnakes.\n\nYou deserve very little credit for being what you are—and remember, the people who come to you\nirritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils.\nPity them. Sympathize with them. Say to yourself, “There, but for the grace of God, go I.”\n\nThree-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to\nthem, and they will love you.",

Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.\n\nEmerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way, In that, I learn of him.”\n\nIf that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me? Let’s cease\nthinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget\nflattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and\npeople will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you\nhave forgotten them.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Give honest and sincere appreciation._**\n\n-----\n\n## 3\n\n###### “HE WHO CAN DO THIS HAS THE WHOLE WORLD WITH HIM. HE WHO CANNOT WALKS A LONELY WAY.”\n\nI often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very fond of strawberries and\ncream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think\nabout what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn’t bait the hook with strawberries and cream.\nRather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said, “Wouldn’t you like to have that?”\n\nWhy not use the same common sense when fishing for people?\n\nThat is what Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister during World War I, did. When someone\nasked him how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime leaders—Wilson, Orlando and\nClemenceau—had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed to any one thing, it\nwould be to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.\n\nWhy talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you\nwant. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in\nwhat we want.\n\nSo the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how\nto get it.\n\nRemember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to do something. If, for example, you\ndon’t want your children to smoke, don’t preach at them, and don’t talk about what you want; but show them\nthat cigarettes may keep them from making the basketball team or winning the hundred-yard dash.\n\nThis is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are dealing with children or calves or\nchimpanzees. For example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they\nmade the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the\ncalf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he wanted, so he stiffened his legs and\nstubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn’t write essays\nand books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought\nof what the calf wanted, so she put her maternal finger in the calf’s mouth and let the calf suck her finger as she\ngently led him into the barn.\n\nEvery act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted\nsomething. How about the time you gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the\nrule. You gave the Red Cross the donation because you wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a\nbeautiful, unselfish, divine act. “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have\ndone it unto me.”\n\nIf you hadn’t wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money, you would not have made the\ncontribution. Of course, you might have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or because a\ncustomer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution because you wanted something.\n\nHarry A. Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human Behavior said, “Action springs out of\nwhat we fundamentally desire, and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether\nin business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who\ncan do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”\n\nAndrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally\ngave away $365 million, learned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the\nother person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he learned how to handle people.\n\n-----\n\nTo illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys. They were at Yale, and they were\nso busy with their own affairs that they neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their mother’s\nfrantic letters.\n\nThen Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an answer by return mail, without\neven asking for it. Someone called his bet, so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a\npost-script that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.\n\nHe neglected, however, to enclose the money.\n\nBack came replies by return mail thanking “Dear Uncle Andrew” for his kind note and…you can finish\nthe sentence yourself.\n\nAnother example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our\ncourse. Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the\nliving room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s\nnormal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind\nto go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the\nbest frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to\nkindergarten?” He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing\nsongs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started finger-painting on the kitchen\ntable—my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner.\nNext he was begging to participate. ‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’\nWith all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand, telling him\nall the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs\nand found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to\ngo to kindergarten. I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager\nwant that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.”\n\nTomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask\nyourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?”\n\nThat question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.\n\nAt one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in\norder to hold a series of lectures.\n\nAt the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times\nas much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all\nannouncements had been made.\n\nNaturally, I didn’t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I\nwanted? They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nAnother member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton, New Hampshire, reported how by\nusing a friendly approach, he obtained a very satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.\n\n“Early in the spring,” he reported, “before the ground had thawed from the winter freezing, there was\nan unusually heavy rainstorm and the water, which normally would have run off to nearby ditches and storm\ndrains along the road, took a new course onto a building lot where I had just built a new home.\n\n“Not being able to run off, the water pressure built up around the foundation of the house. The water\nforced itself under the concrete basement floor, causing it to explode, and the basement filled with water. This\nruined the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to repair this damage was in excess of two thousand\ndollars. I had no insurance to cover this type of damage.\n\n“However, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision had neglected to put in a storm drain near\nthe house which could have prevented this problem I made an appointment to see him. During the twenty-fivemile trip to his office, I carefully reviewed the situation and, remembering the principles I learned in this course,\nI decided that showing my anger would not serve any worthwhile purpose, When I arrived, I kept very calm and\nstarted by talking about his recent vacation to the West Indies; then, when I felt the timing was right, I\nmentioned the ‘little’ problem of water damage. He quickly agreed to do his share in helping to correct the\nproblem.\n\n“A few days later he called and said he would pay for the damage and also put in a storm drain to\nprevent the same thing from happening in the future.\n\n“Even though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision, if I had not begun in a friendly way,\nthere would have been a great deal of difficulty in getting him to agree to the total liability.”\n\nYears ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school out in northwest\nMissouri, I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind\n\n-----\n\nsaid, “I’ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you\ncan.”\n\nSo the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew,\nthe tighter the old man clutched his coat to him.\n\nFinally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and\nsmiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind\nthat gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.\n\nThe use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by people who have learned that a\ndrop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. F. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland, proved this\nwhen he had to take his four-month-old car to the service department of the car dealer for the third time. He told\nour class, “It was apparent that talking to, reasoning with or shouting at the service manager was not going to\nlead to a satisfactory resolution of my problems.\n\n“I walked over to the showroom and asked to see the agency owner, Mr. White. After a short wait, I\nwas ushered into Mr. White’s office. I introduced myself and explained to him that I had bought my car from his\ndealership because of the recommendations of friends who had had previous dealings with him. I was told that\nhis prices were very competitive and his service was outstanding. He smiled with satisfaction as he listened to\nme. I then explained the problem I was having with the service department. ‘I thought you might want to be\naware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,’ I added. He thanked me for calling this to his\nattention and assured me that my problem would be taken care of. Not only did he personal get involved, but he\nalso lent me his car to use while mine was being repaired.”\n\nAesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years\nbefore Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as\nthey were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the\nwind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily\nthan all the bluster and storming in the world.\n\nRemember what Lincoln said, “A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**_Begin in a friendly way._**\n\n-----\n\n## 14\n\n###### “THE SECRET OF SOCRATES.”\n\nIn talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by\nemphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that\nyou are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.\n\nGet the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying\n“No.” A “No” response, according to Professor Overstreet,* is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you\nhave said “No,” all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later\nfeel that the “No” was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a\nthing, you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the\naffirmative direction.\n\n- Harry A. Overstreet, lnfluencing Human Behavior (New York: Norton, 1925).\n\nThe skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of “Yes” responses. This sets the psychological\nprocess of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in\none direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back in the opposite direction.\n\nThe psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says “No” and really means it, he or she\nis doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism—glandular, nervous, muscular—\ngathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable\ndegree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself\non guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says “Yes,” none of the withdrawal activities takes\nplace. The organism is in a forward—moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more “Yeses” we can, at the\nvery outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.\n\nIt is a very simple technique—this “yes” response. And yet, how much it is neglected! It often seems as\nif people get a sense of their own importance by antagonizing others at the outset.\n\nGet a student to say “No” at the beginning, or a customer, child, husband, or wife, and it takes the\nwisdom and the patience of angels to transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.\n\nThe use of this “yes, yes” technique enabled James Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings\nBank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.\n\n“This man came in to open an account,” said Mr. Eberson, “and I gave him our usual form to fill out.\nSome of the questions he answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.",

I was right. Justice—was wrong. And I had told him\nso. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke\nbetter than I ever spoke before. But I didn’t persuade. I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and\nfamous man that he was wrong.”\n\nFew people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with\npreconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don’t want to change\ntheir minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star. So, if you are\ninclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast. It is\nfrom James Harvey Robinson’s enlightening book The Mind in the Making.\n\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we\nare told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the\nformation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob\nus of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which\nis threatened…The little word ‘my’ is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is\nthe beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is ‘my’ dinner, ‘my’ dog, and ‘my’ house, or ‘my’\nfather, ‘my’ country, and ‘my’ God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car\nshabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of “Epictetus”, of the medicinal\nvalue of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have\nbeen accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions\nleads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning\nconsists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.\n\nCarl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On Becoming a Person:\n\nI have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand the other person. The way in\nwhich I have worded this statement may seem strange to you. Is it necessary to permit oneself to understand\nanother? I think it is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we hear from other people) is an\nevaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of it. When someone expresses some feeling, attitude or\nbelief, our tendency is almost immediately to feel “that’s right,” or “that’s stupid,” “that’s abnormal,” “that’s\n\n-----\n\nunreasonable,” “that’s incorrect,” “that’s not nice.” Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely\nwhat the meaning of the statement is to the other person.*\n\n- Adapted from Carl R. Rogers, On Becoming a Person (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1961), pp. 18ff.\n\nI once employed an interior decorator to make some draperies for my home. When the bill arrived, I\nwas dismayed.\n\nA few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the draperies. The price was mentioned, and she\nexclaimed with a note of triumph, “What? That’s awful. I am afraid he put one over on you.”\n\nTrue? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like to listen to truths that reflect on their judgment.\nSo, being human, I tried to defend myself. I pointed out that the best is eventually the cheapest, that one can’t\nexpect to get quality and artistic taste at bargain-basement prices, and so on and on.\n\nThe next day another friend dropped in, admired the draperies, bubbled over with enthusiasm, and\nexpressed a wish that she could afford such exquisite creations for her home. My reaction was totally different.\n“Well, to tell the truth,” I said, “I can’t afford them myself. I paid too much. I’m sorry I ordered them,”\n\nWhen we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may\nadmit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying\nto ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.\n\nHorace Greeley, the most famous editor in America during the time of the Civil War, disagreed\nviolently with Lincoln’s policies. He believed that he could drive Lincoln into agreeing with him by a campaign\nof argument, ridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter campaign month after month, year after year. In fact, he\nwrote a brutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on President Lincoln the night Booth shot him.\n\nBut did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with Greeley? Not at all. Ridicule and abuse never do. If\nyou want some excellent suggestions about dealing with people and managing yourself and improving your\npersonality, read Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography—one of the most fascinating life stories ever written, one\nof the classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells how he conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and\ntransformed himself into one of the most able, suave and diplomatic men in American history.\n\nOne day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth, an old Quaker friend took him aside and lashed\nhim with a few stinging truths, something like this:\n\nBen, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you. They\nhave become so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find they enjoy themselves better when you\nare not around. You know so much that no man can tell you anything. Indeed, no man is going to try, for the\neffort would lead only to discomfort and hard work. So you are not likely ever to know any more than you do\nnow, which is very little.\n\nOne of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is the way he accepted that smarting rebuke. He\nwas big enough and wise enough to realize that it was true, to sense that he was headed for failure and social\ndisaster. So he made a right-about-face. He began immediately to change his insolent, opinionated ways.\n\n“I made it a rule,” said Franklin, “to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiment of others, and all\npositive assertion of my own, I even forbade myself the use of every word or expression in the language that\nimported a fix’d opinion, such as ‘certainly,’ ‘undoubtedly,’ etc., and I adopted, instead of them, ‘I conceive,’ ‘I\napprehend,’ or ‘I imagine’ a thing to be so or so, or ‘it so appears to me at present.’ When another asserted\nsomething that I thought an error, I deny’d myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing\nimmediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or\ncircumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear’d or seem’d to me some\ndifference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag’d in went on\nmore pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos’d my opinions procur’d them a readier reception and less\ncontradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevaile’d with\nothers to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.\n\n-----",

As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet\nin the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane, but it was badly\ndamaged although nobody was hurt.\n\nHoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected,\nthe World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.\n\n-----\n\nUpon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young\nman was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just\ncaused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well.\n\nYou can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise\npilot would unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn’t scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticize him.\nInstead, he put his big arm around the man’s shoulder and said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this\nagain, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.”\n\nOften parents are tempted to criticize their children. You would expect me to say “don’t.” But I will\nnot, I am merely going to say, “Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism,\n‘Father Forgets’.” It originally appeared as an editorial in the People’s Home Journal. We are reprinting it here\nwith the author’s permission, as condensed in the Reader’s Digest.\n\n“Father Forgets” is one of those little pieces which—dashed of in a moment of sincere feeling—strikes\nan echoing chord in so many readers as to become a perennial reprint favorite. Since its first appearance, “Father\nForgets” has been reproduced, writes the author, W. Livingston Larned, “in hundreds of magazines and house\norgans, and in newspapers the country over. It has been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign\nlanguages. I have given personal permission to thousands who wished to read it from school, church, and lecture\nplatforms. It has been ‘on the air’ on countless occasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals have\nused it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems mysteriously to ‘click’. This one certainly\ndid.”\n\nFATHER FORGETS\n_W. Livingston Larned_\n\nListen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond\ncurls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat\nreading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.\n\nThere are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for\nschool because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I\ncalled out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.\n\nAt breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows\non the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train,\nyou turned and waved a hand and called, “Goodbye, Daddy!” and I frowned, and said in reply, “Hold your\nshoulders back!”\n\nThen it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your\nknees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by\nmarching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive, and if you had to buy them you would be\nmore careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!\n\nDo you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt\nlook in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door.\n“What is it you want?” I snapped.\n\nYou said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and\nkissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which\neven neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.\n\nWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear\ncame over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding—this was my\nreward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was\nmeasuring you by the yardstick of my own years.\n\nAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as\nbig as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me\n\n-----\n\ngoodnight. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt\nthere, ashamed!\n\nIt is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during\nyour waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and\nlaugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a\nritual: “He is nothing but a boy—a little boy!”\n\nI am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot,\nI see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother’s arms, your head on her shoulder. I have\nasked too much, too much.\n\nInstead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what\nthey do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism, and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and\nkindness. “To know all is to forgive all.”\n\nAs Dr. Johnson said, “God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days.”\n\nWhy should you and I?\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_Don’t criticize, condemn or complain._**\n\n-----\n\n## 2\n\n###### “THE BIG SECRET OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE.”\n\nThere is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of\nthat? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.\n\nRemember, there is no other way.\n\nOf course, you can make someone want to give you his watch by sticking a revolver in his ribs. You\ncan make your employees give you cooperation—until your back is turned—by threatening to fire them. You\ncan make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But these crude methods have sharply\nundesirable repercussions.\n\nThe only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nSigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire\nto be great.\n\nJohn Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey\nsaid that the deepest urge in human nature is “the desire to be important\". Remember that phrase: “the desire to\nbe important.\" It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in this book.\n\nWhat do you want? Not many things, but the few that you do wish, you crave with an insistence that\nwill not be denied. Some of the things most people want include:\n\n1. Health and the preservation of life.\n2. Food.\n3. Sleep.\n4. Money and the things money will buy.\n5. Life in the hereafter.\n6. Sexual gratification.\n7. The well-being of our children.\n8. A feeling of importance.",
