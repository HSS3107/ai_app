You will now be instructed\nhow to build plans which will be practical, viz:—\n\n(a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the\ncreation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money\n— making use of the \"Master Mind\" principle described in a later chapter.\n(Compliance with this instruction is absolutely essential. Do not neglect it.)\n\n(b) Before forming your \"Master Mind\" alliance, decide what advantages,\nand benefits, you may offer the individual members of your group, in return for\ntheir cooperation. No one will work indefinitely without some form of\ncompensation. No intelligent person will either request or expect another to\nwork without adequate compensation, although this may not always be in the\nform of money.\n\n(c) Arrange to meet with the members of your \"Master Mind\" group at\nleast twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected\nthe necessary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n100\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

If you fail to carry out this instruction to the letter,\nyou may expect to meet with failure. The \"Master Mind\" principle cannot obtain\nwhere PERFECT HARMONY does not prevail.\n\nKeep in mind these facts:—\nFirst. You are engaged in an undertaking of major importance to you. To be sure\nof success, you must have plans which are faultless.\n\nSecond. You must have the advantage of the experience, education, native ability\nand imagination of other minds. This is in harmony with the methods followed\nby every person who has accumulated a great fortune.\n\nNo individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and\nknowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the\ncooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to\naccumulate wealth, should be the joint creation of yourself and every other\nmember of your \"Master Mind\" group. You may originate your own plans, either\nin whole or in part, but SEE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE CHECKED, AND\nAPPROVED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR \"MASTER MIND\" ALLIANCE.\n\nIf the first plan which you adopt does not work successfully, replace it\nwith a new plan, if this new plan fails to work, replace it, in turn with still\nanother, and so on, until you find a plan which DOES WORK. Right here is the\npoint at which the majority of men meet with failure, because of their lack of\nPERSISTENCE in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.\n\nThe most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money—\nnor in any other undertaking— without plans which are practical and workable.\nJust keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary\ndefeat is not permanent failure. It may only mean that your plans have not been\nsound. Build other plans. Start all over again.\n\nThomas A. Edison \"failed\" ten thousand times before he perfected the\nincandescent electric light bulb. That is— he met with temporary defeat ten\nthousand times, before his efforts were crowned with success.\n\nTemporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that\nthere is something wrong with your plan. Millions of men go through life in\nmisery and poverty, because they lack a sound plan through which to\naccumulate a fortune.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n101\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

A\nthousand men could be pointed out, each with a better education than Ford's, yet\neach of whom lives in poverty, because he does not possess the RIGHT plan for\nthe accumulation of money.\n\nYour achievement can be no greater than your PLANS are sound. That\nmay seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true. Samuel Insull lost his\nfortune of over one hundred million dollars. The Insull fortune was built on\nplans which were sound. The business depression forced Mr. Insull to CHANGE\nHIS PLANS; and the CHANGE brought \"temporary defeat,\" because his new\nplans were NOT SOUND. Mr. Insull is now an old man, he may, consequently,\naccept \"failure\" instead of \"temporary defeat,\" but if his experience turns out to\nbe FAILURE, it will be for the reason that he lacks the fire of PERSISTENCE to\nrebuild his plans.\n\nNo man is ever whipped, until he QUITS— in his own mind.\nThis fact will be repeated many times, because it is so easy to \"take the\ncount\" at the first sign of defeat.\n\nJames J. Hill met with temporary defeat when he first endeavored to raise\nthe necessary capital to build a railroad from the East to the West, but he, too\nturned defeat into victory through new plans.\n\nHenry Ford met with temporary defeat, not only at the beginning of his\nautomobile career, but after he had gone far toward the top. He created new\nplans, and went marching on to financial victory.\n\nWe see men who have accumulated great fortunes, but we often recognize\nonly their triumph, overlooking the temporary defeats which they had to\nsurmount before \"arriving.\"\n\nNO FOLLOWER OF THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT\nTO ACCUMULATE A FORTUNE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING \"TEMPORARY\nDEFEAT.\" When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound,\nrebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal. If you give\nup before your goal has been reached, you are a \"quitter.\"\n\nA QUITTER NEVER WINS—AND— A WINNER NEVER QUITS.\nLift this sentence out, write it on a piece of paper in letters an inch high,\nand place it where you will see it every night before you go to sleep, and every\nmorning before you go to work.\n\nWhen you begin to select members for your \"Master Mind\" group,\nendeavor to select those who do not take defeat seriously.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n102\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This is\nnot true! DESIRE, transmuted into its monetary equivalent, through the\nprinciples laid down here, is the agency through which money is \"made.\" Money,\nof itself, is nothing but inert matter. It cannot move, think, or talk, but it can\n\"hear\" when a man who DESIRES it, calls it to come!\n\nPLANNING THE SALE OF SERVICES\n\nThe remainder of this chapter has been given over to a description of ways\nand means of marketing personal services. The information here conveyed will\nbe of practical help to any person having any form of personal services to\nmarket, but it will be of priceless benefit to those who aspire to leadership in\ntheir chosen occupations.\n\nIntelligent planning is essential for success in any undertaking designed to\naccumulate riches. Here will be found detailed instructions to those who must\nbegin the accumulation of riches by selling personal services.\n\nIt should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes\nbegan in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of\nIDEAS. What else, except ideas and personal services, would one not possessed\nof property have to give in return for riches?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of people in the world. One type is\nknown as LEADERS, and the other as FOLLOWERS. Decide at the outset\nwhether you intend to become a leader in your chosen calling, or remain a\nfollower. The difference in compensation is vast. The follower cannot reasonably\nexpect the compensation to which a leader is entitled, although many followers\nmake the mistake of expecting such pay.\n\nIt is no disgrace to be a follower. On the other hand, it is no credit to\nremain a follower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They\nbecame great leaders because they were INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS. With few\nexceptions, the man who cannot follow a leader intelligently, cannot become an\nefficient leader. The man who can follow a leader most efficiently, is usually the\nman who develops into leadership most rapidly. An intelligent follower has\nmany advantages, among them the OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE\nKNOWLEDGE FROM HIS LEADER.\n\nTHE MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n103\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook? Discover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com |103|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following are important factors of leadership:—\n\n1. UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's\noccupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks selfconfidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a\nleader very long.\n\n2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never\ncontrol others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the\nmore intelligent will emulate.\n\n3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no\nleader can command and retain the respect of his followers.\n\n4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions,\nshows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.\n\n5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work,\nand work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite\nplans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on\nthe rocks.\n\n6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties\nof leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do\nmore than he requires of his followers.\n\n7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become\na successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a\nleader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality.\n\n8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be\nin sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their\nproblems.\n\n9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of\ndetails of the leader's position.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n104\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook? Discover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com |104|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n10. WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful\nleader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the\nshortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not\nremain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself\nincompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.\n\n11. COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply\nthe principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the\nsame. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION.\n\nThere are two forms of Leadership. The first, and by far the most effective,\nis LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The\nsecond is LEADERSHIP BY FORCE, without the consent and sympathy of the\nfollowers.\n\nHistory is filled with evidences that Leadership by Force cannot endure.\nThe downfall and disappearance of \"Dictators\" and kings is significant. It means\nthat people will not follow forced leadership indefinitely.\n\nThe world has just entered a new era of relationship between leaders and\nfollowers, which very clearly calls for new leaders, and a new brand of\nleadership in business and industry. Those who belong to the old school of\nleadership-by-force, must acquire an understanding of the new brand of\nleadership (cooperation) or be relegated to the rank and file of the followers.\nThere is no other way out for them.\n\nThe relationship of employer and employee, or of leader and follower, in\nthe future, will be one of mutual cooperation, based upon an equitable division\nof the profits of business. In the future, the relationship of employer and\nemployee will be more like a partnership than it has been in the past.\n\nNapoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, the Czar of Russia, and the King\nof Spain were examples of leadership by force. Their leadership passed. Without\nmuch difficulty, one might point to the prototypes of these ex-leaders, among the\nbusiness, financial, and labor leaders of America who have been dethroned or\nslated to go. Leadership-by-consent of the followers is the only brand which can\nendure!\n\nMen may follow the forced leadership temporarily, but they will not do so\nwillingly.\n\nThe new brand of LEADERSHIP will embrace the eleven factors of\nleadership, described in this chapter, as well as some other factors. The man who\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n105\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The depression was prolonged, largely, because the world\nlacked LEADERSHIP of the new brand. At the end of the depression, the\ndemand for leaders who are competent to apply the new methods of leadership\nhas greatly exceeded the supply. Some of the old type of leaders will reform and\nadapt themselves to the new brand of leadership, but generally speaking, the\nworld will have to look for new timber for its leadership. This necessity may be\n_your OPPORTUNITY!_\n\nTHE 10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP\n\nWe come now to the major faults of leaders who fail, because it is just as\nessential to know WHAT NOT TO DO as it is to know what to do.\n\n1. INABILITY TO ORGANIZE DETAILS. Efficient\nleadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No\ngenuine leader is ever \"too busy\" to do anything which may be\nrequired of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he\nis a leader or follower, admits that he is \"too busy\" to change his\nplans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his\ninefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details\nconnected with his position. That means, of course, that he must\nacquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants.\n\n2. UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE.\nTruly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform\nany sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. \"The\ngreatest among ye shall be the servant of all\" is a truth which all\nable leaders observe and respect.\n\n3. EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY \"KNOW\"\nINSTEAD OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY\nKNOW. The world does not pay men for that which they \"know.\" It\npays them for what they DO, or induce others to do.\n\n4. FEAR OF COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERS. The\nleader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n106\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook? Discover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com |106|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\npractically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader\ntrains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the\ndetails of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply\nhimself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give\nattention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men\nreceive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO\nPERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An\nefficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the\nmagnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of\nothers, and induce them to render more service and better service\nthan they could render without his aid.\n\n5. LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the\nleader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans\nby which to guide his followers efficiently.\n\n6. SELFISHNESS. The leader who claims all the honor for the\nwork of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really\ngreat leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to\nsee the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he\nknows that most men will work harder for commendation and\nrecognition than they will for money alone.\n\n7. INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an\nintemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various\nforms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in\nit.\n\n8. DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this should have come at the head\nof the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his\nassociates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long\nmaintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the\ndust of the earth, and brings down on one's head the contempt he\ndeserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in\nevery walk of life.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n107\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook? Discover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com |107|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n9. EMPHASIS OF THE \"AUTHORITY\" OF LEADERSHIP.\nThe efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instil\nfear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress\nhis followers with his \"authority\" comes within the category of\nleadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, he will\nhave no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct— his\nsympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he\nknows his job.\n\n10. EMPHASIS OF TITLE. The competent leader requires no\n\"title\" to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes\ntoo much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The\ndoors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to\nenter, and his working quarters are free from formality or\nostentation.\n\nThese are among the more common of the causes of failure in leadership.\nAny one of these faults is sufficient to induce failure. Study the list carefully if\nyou aspire to leadership, and make sure that you are free of these faults.\n\nSOME FERTILE FIELDS IN WHICH \"NEW LEADERSHIP\" WILL\n\nBE REQUIRED\n\nBefore leaving this chapter, your attention is called to a few of the fertile\nfields in which there has been a decline of leadership, and in which the new type\nof leader may find an abundance of OPPORTUNITY.\n\nFirst. In the field of politics there is a most insistent demand\nfor new leaders; a demand which indicates nothing less than an\nemergency. The majority of politicians have, seemingly, become\nhigh-grade, legalized racketeers. They have increased taxes and\ndebauched the machinery of industry and business until the people\ncan no longer stand the burden.\n\nSecond. The banking business is undergoing a reform. The\nleaders in this field have almost entirely lost the confidence of the\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n108\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook? Discover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com |108|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\npublic. Already the bankers have sensed the need of reform, and\nthey have begun it.\n\nThird. Industry calls for new leaders. The old type of leaders\nthought and moved in terms of dividends instead of thinking and\nmoving in terms of human equations! The future leader in industry,\nto endure, must regard himself as a quasi-public official whose\nduty it is to manage his trust in such a way that it will work\nhardship on no individual, or group of individuals. Exploitation of\nworking men is a thing of the past. Let the man who aspires to\nleadership in the field of business, industry, and labor remember\nthis.\n\nFourth. The religious leader of the future will be forced to\ngive more attention to the temporal needs of his followers, in the\nsolution of their economic and personal problems of the present,\nand less attention to the dead past, and the yet unborn future.\n\nFifth. In the professions of law, medicine, and education, a\nnew brand of leadership, and to some extent, new leaders will\nbecome a necessity. This is especially true in the field of education.\nThe leader in that field must, in the future, find ways and means of\nteaching people HOW TO APPLY the knowledge they receive in\nschool. He must deal more with PRACTICE and less with\nTHEORY.\n\nSixth. New leaders will be required in the field of\nJournalism. Newspapers of the future, to be conducted\nsuccessfully, must be divorced from \"special privilege\" and relieved\nfrom the subsidy of advertising. They must cease to be organs of\npropaganda for the interests which patronize their advertising\ncolumns. The type of newspaper which publishes scandal and lewd\npictures will eventually go the way of all forces which debauch the\nhuman mind.\n\nThese are but a few of the fields in which opportunities for new leaders\nand a new brand of leadership are now available. The world is undergoing a\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n109\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This means that the media through which the changes in human\nhabits are promoted, must be adapted to the changes. The media here described,\nare the ones which, more than any others, determine the trend of civilization.\n\nWHEN AND HOW TO APPLY FOR A POSITION\n\nThe information described here is the net result of many years of\nexperience during which thousands of men and women were helped to market\ntheir services effectively. It can, therefore, be relied upon as sound and practical.\n\nMEDIA THROUGH WHICH SERVICES MAY BE\n\nMARKETED\n\nExperience has proved that the following media offer the most direct and\neffective methods of bringing the buyer and seller of personal services together.\n\n1. EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS. Care must be taken to select only reputable\nbureaus, the management of which can show adequate records of achievement of\nsatisfactory results. There are comparatively few such bureaus.\n\n2. ADVERTISING in newspapers, trade journals, magazines, and radio.\nClassified advertising may usually be relied upon to produce satisfactory results\nin the case of those who apply for clerical or ordinary salaried positions. Display\nadvertising is more desirable in the case of those who seek executive connections,\nthe copy to appear in the section of the paper which is most apt to come to the\nattention of the class of employer being sought. The copy should be prepared by\nan expert, who understands how to inject sufficient selling qualities to produce\nreplies.\n\n3. PERSONAL LETTERS OF APPLICATION, directed to particular firms\nor individuals most apt to need such services as are being offered. Letters should\nbe neatly typed, ALWAYS, and signed by hand. With the letter, should be sent a\ncomplete \"brief\" or outline of the applicant's qualifications. Both the letter of\napplication and the brief of experience or qualifications should be prepared by an\nexpert. (See instructions as to information to be supplied).\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n110\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

When\npossible, the applicant should endeavor to approach prospective employers\nthrough some mutual acquaintance. This method of approach is particularly\nadvantageous in the case of those who seek executive connections and do not\nwish to appear to be \"peddling\" themselves.\n\n5. APPLICATION IN PERSON. In some instances, it may be more\neffective if the applicant offers personally, his services to prospective employers,\nin which event a complete written statement of qualifications for the position\nshould be presented, for the reason that prospective employers often wish to\ndiscuss with associates, one's record.\n\nINFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED IN A WRITTEN \"BRIEF\"\n\nThis brief should be prepared as carefully as a lawyer would prepare the\nbrief of a case to be tried m court. Unless the applicant is experienced in the\npreparation of such briefs, an expert should be consulted, and his services\nenlisted for this purpose. Successful merchants employ men and women who\nunderstand the art and the psychology of advertising to present the merits of\ntheir merchandise. One who has personal services for sale should do the same.\nThe following information should appear in the brief:\n\n1. Education. State briefly, but definitely, what schooling you have had,\nand in what subjects you specialized in school, giving the reasons for that\nspecialization.\n\n2. Experience. If you have had experience in connection with positions\nsimilar to the one you seek, describe it fully, state names and addresses of former\nemployers. Be sure to bring out clearly any special experience you may have had\nwhich would equip you to fill the position you seek.\n\n3. References. Practically every business firm desires to know all about the\nprevious records, antecedents, etc., of prospective employees who seek positions\nof responsibility. Attach to your brief photostatic copies of letters from:\n\na. Former employers\nb. Teachers under whom you studied\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n111\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Prominent people whose judgement may be relied upon.\n\n4. Photograph of self. Attach to your brief a recent, unmounted photograph\nof yourself.\n\n5. Apply for a specific position. Avoid application for a position without\ndescribing EXACTLY what particular position you seek. Never apply for \"just a\nposition.\" That indicates you lack specialized qualifications.\n\n6. State your qualifications for the particular position for which you apply.\nGive full details as to the reason you believe you are qualified for the particular\nposition you seek. This is THE APPLICATION. It will determine, more than\nanything else, what consideration you receive.\n\n7. Offer to go to work on probation. In the majority of instances if you are\ndetermined to have the position for which you apply, it will be most effective if\nyou offer to work for a week, or a month, or for a sufficient length of time to\nenable your prospective employer to judge your value WITHOUT PAY. This\nmay appear to be a radical suggestion, but experience has proved that it seldom\nfails to win at least a trial. If you are SURE OF YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, a trial\nis all you need. Incidentally, such an offer indicates that you have confidence in\nyour ability to fill the position you seek. It is most convincing. If your offer is\naccepted, and you make good, more than likely you will be paid for your\n\"probation\" period. Make clear the fact that your offer is based upon:\n\na. Your confidence in your ability to fill the position.\nb. Your confidence in your prospective employer's decision\nto employ you after trial.\nc. Your DETERMINATION to have the position you seek.\n\n8. Knowledge of your prospective employer's business. Before applying for a\nposition, do sufficient research in connection with the business to familiarize\nyourself thoroughly with that business, and indicate in your brief the knowledge\nyou have acquired in this field. This will be impressive, as it will indicate that\nyou have imagination, and a real interest in the position you seek.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n112\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

If your \"case\" is properly prepared and\npresented, your victory will have been more than half won at the outset.\n\nDo not be afraid of making your brief too long. Employers are just as\nmuch interested in purchasing the services of well-qualified applicants as you are\nin securing employment. In fact, the success of most successful employers is due,\nin the main, to their ability to select well-qualified lieutenants. They want all the\ninformation available.\n\nRemember another thing; neatness in the preparation of your brief will\nindicate that you are a painstaking person. I have helped to prepare briefs for\nclients which were so striking and out of the ordinary that they resulted in the\nemployment of the applicant without a personal interview.\n\nWhen your brief has been completed, have it neatly bound by an\nexperienced binder, and lettered by an artist, or printer similar to the following:\n\nBRIEF OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF\n\nRobert K. Smith\nAPPLYING FOR THE POSITION OF\n\nPrivate Secretary to The President of\n\nTHE BLANK COMPANY, Inc.\n\nChange names each time brief is shown.\nThis personal touch is sure to command attention. Have your brief neatly\ntyped or mimeographed on the finest paper you can obtain, and bound with a\nheavy paper of the book-cover variety, the binder to be changed, and the proper\nfirm name to be inserted if it is to be shown to more than one company. Your\nphotograph should be pasted on one of the pages of your brief. Follow these\ninstructions to the letter, improving upon them wherever your imagination\nsuggests.\n\nSuccessful salesmen groom themselves with care. They understand that\nfirst impressions are lasting. Your brief is your salesman. Give it a good suit of\nclothes, so it will stand out in bold contrast to anything your prospective\nemployer ever saw, in the way of an application for a position. If the position you\nseek is worth having, it is worth going after with care. Moreover, if you sell\nyourself to an employer in a manner that impresses him with your individuality,\nyou probably will receive more money for your services from the very start, than\nyou would if you applied for employment in the usual conventional way.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n113\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This will help to gain preference for you, both with the agent, and the\nprospective employers.\n\nHOW TO GET THE EXACT POSITION YOU DESIRE\n\nEveryone enjoys doing the kind of work for which he is best suited. An\nartist loves to work with paints, a craftsman with his hands, a writer loves to\nwrite. Those with less definite talents have their preferences for certain fields of\nbusiness and industry. If America does anything well, it offers a full range of\noccupations, tilling the soil, manufacturing, marketing, and the professions.\n\nFirst. Decide EXACTLY what kind of a job you want. If the job doesn't\nalready exist, perhaps you can create it.\n\nSecond. Choose the company, or individual for whom you wish to work.\n\nThird. Study your prospective employer, as to policies, personnel, and\nchances of advancement.\n\nFourth. By analysis of yourself, your talents and capabilities, figure\nWHAT YOU CAN OFFER, and plan ways and means of giving advantages,\nservices, developments, ideas that you believe you can successfully deliver.\n\nFifth. Forget about \"a job.\" Forget whether or not there is an opening.\nForget the usual routine of \"have you got a job for me?\" Concentrate on what you\n_can give._\n\nSixth. Once you have your plan in mind, arrange with an experienced\nwriter to put it on paper in neat form, and in full detail.\n\nSeventh. Present it to the proper person with authority and he will do the\nrest. Every company is looking for men who can give something of value,\nwhether it be ideas, services, or \"connections.\" Every company has room for the\nman who has a definite plan of action which is to the advantage of that company.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n114\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The employer\nb. The employee\nc. The public they serve\nThis new way of marketing personal services is called new for many\nreasons, first, both the employer and the employee of the future will be\nconsidered as fellow-employees whose business it will be to SERVE THE\nPUBLIC EFFICIENTLY. In times past, employers, and employees have bartered\namong themselves, driving the best bargains they could with one another, not\nconsidering that in the final analysis they were, in reality, BARGAINING AT\nTHE EXPENSE OF THE THIRD PARTY, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVED.\n\nThe depression served as a mighty protest from an injured public, whose\nrights had been trampled upon in every direction by those who were clamoring\nfor individual advantages and profits. When the debris of the depression shall\nhave been cleared away, and business shall have been once again restored to\nbalance, both employers and employees will recognize that they are NO\nLONGER PRIVILEGED TO DRIVE BARGAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE\nWHOM THEY SERVE. The real employer of the future will be the public.

Who does not\nremember the day when, if a citizen enquired at the ticket office, the time of\ndeparture of a train, he was abruptly referred to the bulletin board instead of\nbeing politely given the information?\n\nThe street car companies have experienced a \"change of times\" also. There\nwas a time not so very long ago when street car conductors took pride in giving\nargument to passengers. Many of the street car tracks have been removed and\npassengers ride on a bus, whose driver is \"the last word in politeness.\"\n\nAll over the country street car tracks are rusting from abandonment, or\nhave been taken up. Whereever street cars are still in operation, passengers may\nnow ride without argument, and one may even hail the car in the middle of the\nblock, and the motorman will OBLIGINGLY pick him up.\n\nHOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED! That is just the point I am trying to\nemphasize. TIMES HAVE CHANGED! Moreover, the change is reflected not\nmerely in railroad offices and on street cars, but in other walks of life as well. The\n\"public-be-damned\" policy is now passé. It has been supplanted by the \"we-areobligingly-at-your-service, sir,\" policy.\n\nThe bankers have learned a thing or two during this rapid change which\nhas taken place during the past few years. Impoliteness on the part of a bank\nofficial, or bank employee today is as rare as it was conspicuous a dozen years\nago. In the years past, some bankers (not all of them, of course), carried an\natmosphere of austerity which gave every would-be borrower a chill when he\neven thought of approaching his banker for a loan.\n\nThe thousands of bank failures during the depression had the effect of\nremoving the mahogany doors behind which bankers formerly barricaded\nthemselves. They now sit at desks in the open, where they may be seen and\napproached at will by any depositor, or by anyone who wishes to see them, and\nthe whole atmosphere of the bank is one of courtesy and understanding.\n\nIt used to be customary for customers to have to stand and wait at the\ncorner grocery until the clerks were through passing the time of day with friends,\nand the proprietor had finished making up his bank deposit, before being waited\nupon. Chain stores, managed by COURTEOUS MEN who do everything in the\nway of service, short of shining the customer's shoes, have PUSHED THE OLDTIME MERCHANTS INTO THE BACKGROUND.

If\nthey fail to serve well, they pay by the loss of their privilege of serving.\n\nWe can all remember the time when the gas-meter reader pounded on the\ndoor hard enough to break the panels. When the door was opened, he pushed his\nway in, uninvited, with a scowl on his face which plainly said, \"what-the-helldid-you-keep-me-waiting- for?\" All that has undergone a change. The meter-man\nnow conducts himself as a gentleman who is \"delighted-to-be-at-your-servicesir.\" Before the gas companies learned that their scowling meter-men were\naccumulating liabilities never to be cleared away, the polite salesmen of oil\nburners came along and did a land office business.\n\nDuring the depression, I spent several months in the anthracite coal region\nof Pennsylvania, studying conditions which all but destroyed the coal industry.\nAmong several very significant discoveries, was the fact that greed on the part of\noperators and their employees was the chief cause of the loss of business for the\noperators, and loss of jobs for the miners.\n\nThrough the pressure of a group of overzealous labor leaders,\nrepresenting the employees, and the greed for profits on the part of the\noperators, the anthracite business suddenly dwindled. The coal operators and\ntheir employees drove sharp bargains with one another, adding the cost of the\n\"bargaining\" to the price of the coal, until, finally, they discovered they had\nBUILT UP A WONDERFUL BUSINESS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS OF OIL\nBURNING OUTFITS AND THE PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL.\n\n\"The wages of sin is death!\" Many have read this in the Bible, but few have\ndiscovered its meaning. Now, and for several years, the entire world has been\nlistening BY FORCE, to a sermon which might well be called \"WHATSOEVER A\nMAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP.\"\n\nNothing as widespread and effective as the depression could possibly be\n\"just a coincidence.\" Behind the depression was a CAUSE. Nothing ever happens\nwithout a CAUSE. In the main, the cause of the depression is traceable directly to\nthe worldwide habit of trying to REAP without SOWING.\n\nThis should not be mistaken to mean that the depression represents a crop\nwhich the world is being FORCED to reap without having SOWN. The trouble is\nthat the world sowed the wrong sort of seed. Any farmer knows he cannot sow the\nseed of thistles, and reap a harvest of grain. Beginning at the outbreak of the\nworld war, the people of the world began to sow the seed of service inadequate\nin both quality and quantity.

If there is a principle of cause and effect, which controls_\nbusiness, finance, and transportation, this same principle controls individuals\nand determines their economic status.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR \"QQS\" RATING?\n\nThe causes of success in marketing services EFFECTIVELY and\npermanently, have been clearly described. Unless those causes are studied,\nanalyzed, understood and APPLIED, no man can market his services effectively\nand permanently. Every person must be his own salesman of personal services.\nThe QUALITY and the QUANTITY of service rendered, and the SPIRIT in which\nit is rendered, determine to a large extent, the price, and the duration of\nemployment. To market Personal services effectively, (which means a permanent\nmarket, at a satisfactory price, under pleasant conditions), one must adopt and\nfollow the \"QQS\" formula which means that QUALITY, plus QUANTITY, plus\nthe proper SPIRIT of cooperation, equals perfect salesmanship of service.\nRemember the \"QQS\" formula, but do more—APPLY IT AS A HABIT!\n\nLet us analyze the formula to make sure we understand exactly what it\nmeans.\n\n1. QUALITY of service shall be construed to mean the performance of\nevery detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner\npossible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind.\n\n2. QUANTITY of service shall be understood to mean the HABIT of\nrendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose\nof increasing the amount of service rendered as greater skill is developed\nthrough practice and experience. Emphasis is again placed on the word HABIT.\n\n3. SPIRIT of service shall be construed to mean the HABIT of agreeable,\narmonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow\nemployees.\n\nAdequacy of QUALITY and QUANTITY of service is not sufficient to\nmaintain a permanent market for your services. The conduct, or the SPIRIT in\nwhich you deliver service, is a strong determining factor in connection with both\nthe price you receive, and the duration of employment.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n118\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

He emphasized again, and again, the necessity for HARMONIOUS\nCONDUCT. He stressed the fact that he would not retain any man, no matter\nhow great a QUANTITY, or how efficient the QUALITY of his work, unless he\nworked in a spirit of HARMONY. Mr. Carnegie insisted upon men being\nAGREEABLE.\n\nTo prove that he placed a high value upon this quality, he permitted many\nmen who conformed to his standards to become very wealthy. Those who did not\nconform, had to make room for others.\n\nThe importance of a pleasing personality has been stressed, because it is a\nfactor which enables one to render service in the proper SPIRIT. If one has a\npersonality which PLEASES, and renders service in a spirit of HARMONY, these\nassets often make up for deficiencies in both the QUALITY, and the QUANTITY\nof service one renders. Nothing, however, can be SUCCESSFULLY\nSUBSTITUTED FOR PLEASING CONDUCT.\n\nTHE CAPITAL VALUE OF YOUR SERVICES\n\nThe person whose income is derived entirely from the sale of personal\nservices is no less a merchant than the man who sells commodities, and it might\nwell be added, such a person is subject to EXACTLY THE SAME RULES of\nconduct as the merchant who sells merchandise.\n\nThis has been emphasized, because the majority of people who live by the\nsale of personal services make the mistake of considering themselves free from\nthe rules of conduct, and the responsibilities attached to those who are engaged\nin marketing commodities.\n\nThe new way of marketing services has practically forced both employer\nand. employee into partnership alliances, through which both take into\nconsideration the rights of the third party, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE.\n\nThe day of the \"go-getter\" has passed. He has been supplanted by the \"gogiver.\" High-pressure methods in business finally blew the lid off. There will\nnever be the need to put the lid back on, because, in the future, business will be\nconducted by methods that will require no pressure.\n\nThe actual capital value of your brains may be determined by the amount\nof income you can produce (by marketing your services). A fair estimate of the\ncapital value of your services may be made by multiplying your annual income\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n119\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Money rents for 6% per annum.\nMoney is worth no more than brains. It is often worth much less.\n\nCompetent \"brains,\" if effectively marketed, represent a much more\ndesirable form of capital than that which is required to conduct a business\ndealing in commodities, because \"brains\" are a form of capital which cannot be\npermanently depreciated through depressions, nor can this form of capital be\nstolen or spent. Moreover, the money which is essential for the conduct of\nbusiness is as worthless as a sand dune, until it has been mixed with efficient\n\"brains.\"\n\nTHE THIRTY MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE\nHOW MANY OF THESE ARE HOLDING YOU BACK?\n\nLife's greatest tragedy consists of men and women who earnestly try, and\nfail! The tragedy lies in the overwhelmingly large majority of people who fail, as\ncompared to the few who succeed.\n\nI have had the privilege of analyzing several thousand men and women,\n98% of whom were classed as \"failures.\" There is something radically wrong with\na civilization, and a system of education, which permit 98% of the people to go\nthrough life as failures. But I did not write this book for the purpose of\nmoralizing on the rights and wrongs of the world; that would require a book a\nhundred times the size of this one.\n\nMy analysis work proved that there are thirty major reasons for failure,\nand thirteen major principles through which people accumulate fortunes. In this\nchapter, a description of the thirty major causes of failure will be given. As you\ngo over the list, check yourself by it, point by point, for the purpose of\ndiscovering how many of these causes-of-failure stand between you and success.\n\n1. UNFAVORABLE HEREDITARY BACKGROUND. There\nis but little, if anything, which can be done for people who are born\nwith a deficiency in brain power. This philosophy offers but one\nmethod of bridging this weakness— through the aid of the Master\nMind.

There is\nno hope of success for the person who does not have a central\npurpose, or definite goal at which to aim. Ninety-eight out of every\nhundred of those whom I have analyzed, had no such aim. Perhaps\nthis was the\n\n3. LACK OF AMBITION TO AIM ABOVE MEDIOCRITY.\nWe offer no hope for the person who is so indifferent as not to want\nto get ahead in life, and who is not willing to pay the price.\n\n4. INSUFFICIENT EDUCATION. This is a handicap which\nmay be overcome with comparative ease. Experience has proven\nthat the best-educated people are often those who are known as\n\"self-made,\" or self-educated. It takes more than a college degree to\nmake one a person of education. Any person who is educated is\none who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without\nviolating the rights of others. Education consists, not so much of\nknowledge, but of knowledge effectively and persistently\nAPPLIED. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more\nparticularly for WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY\nKNOW.\n\n5. LACK OF SELF-DISCIPLINE. Discipline comes through\nself-control. This means that one must control all negative qualities.\nBefore you can control conditions, you must first control yourself.\nSelf-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not\nconquer self, you will be conquered by self. You may see at one and\nthe same time both your best friend and your greatest enemy, by\nstepping in front of a mirror.\n\n6. ILL HEALTH. No person may enjoy outstanding success\nwithout good health. Many of the causes of ill health are subject to\nmastery and control. These, in the main are:\n\na. Overeating of foods not conducive to health\nb. Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to\nnegatives.\nc. Wrong use of, and over indulgence in sex.\nd. Lack of proper physical exercise\ne. An inadequate supply of fresh air, due to improper\nbreathing.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n121\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES\nDURING CHILDHOOD. \"As the twig is bent, so shall the tree\ngrow.\" Most people who have criminal tendencies acquire them as\nthe result of bad environment, and improper associates during\nchildhood.\n\n8. PROCRASTINATION. This is one of the most common\ncauses of failure. \"Old Man Procrastination\" stands within the\nshadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil\none's chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures,\nbecause we are waiting for the \"time to be right\" to start doing\nsomething worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be \"just\nright.\" Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you\nmay have at your command, and better tools will be found as you\ngo along.\n\n9. LACK OF PERSISTENCE. Most of us are good \"starters\"\nbut poor \"finishers\" of everything we begin. Moreover, people are\nprone to give up at the first signs of defeat. There is no substitute\nfor PERSISTENCE. The person who makes PERSISTENCE his\nwatch-word, discovers that \"Old Man Failure\" finally becomes\ntired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with\nPERSISTENCE.\n\n10. NEGATIVE PERSONALITY. There is no hope of success\nfor the person who repels people through a negative personality.\nSuccess comes through the application of POWER, and power is\nattained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative\npersonality will not induce cooperation.\n\n11. LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE. Sex energy is\nthe most powerful of all the stimuli which move people into\nACTION. Because it is the most powerful of the emotions, it must\nbe controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other\nchannels.\n\n12. UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR \"SOMETHING FOR\nNOTHING.\" The gambling instinct drives millions of people to\nfailure. Evidence of this may be found in a study of the Wall Street\ncrash of '29, during which millions of people tried to make money\nby gambling on stock margins.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n122\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

LACK OF A WELL DEFINED POWER OF DECISION.\nMen who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at\nall, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly,\nand change them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and\nprocrastination are twin brothers. Where one is found, the other\nmay usually be found also. Kill off this pair before they completely\n\"hog-tie\" you to the treadmill of FAILURE.\n\n14. ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX BASIC FEARS. These fears\nhave been analyzed for you in a later chapter. They must be\nmastered before you can market your services effectively.\n\n15. WRONG SELECTION OF A MATE IN MARRIAGE. This\na most common cause of failure. The relationship of marriage\nbrings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is\nharmonious, failure is likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form\nof failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all\nsigns of AMBITION.\n\n16. OVER-CAUTION. The person who takes no chances,\ngenerally has to take whatever is left when others are through\nchoosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are\nextremes to be guarded against. Life itself is filled with the element\nof chance.\n\n17. WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES IN BUSINESS.\nThis is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In\nmarketing personal services, one should use great care to select an\nemployer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself,\nintelligent and successful. We emulate those with whom we\nassociate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating.\n\n18. SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE. Superstition is a\nform of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep\nopen minds and are afraid of nothing.\n\n19. WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION. No man can\nsucceed in a line of endeavor which he does not like. The most\nessential step in the marketing of personal services is that of\nselecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself\nwholeheartedly.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n123\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The \"jack-ofall-trades\" seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on\none DEFINITE CHIEF AIM.\n\n21. THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING. The\nspend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in\nFEAR OF POVERTY. Form the habit of systematic saving by\nputting aside a definite percentage of your income. Money in the\nbank gives one a very safe foundation of COURAGE when bargaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must\ntake what one is offered, and be glad to get it.\n\n22. LACK OF ENTHUSIASM. Without enthusiasm one\ncannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the\nperson who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any\ngroup of people.\n\n23. INTOLERANCE. The person with a \"closed\" mmd on\nany subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has\nstopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of\nintolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political\ndifferences of opinion.\n\n24. INTEMPERANCE. The most damaging forms of\nintemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual\nactivities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success.\n\n25. INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS. More\npeople lose their positions and their big opportunities in life,\nbecause of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a\nfault which no well-informed business man, or leader will tolerate.\n\n26. POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NOT ACQUIRED\nTHROUGH SELF EFFORT. (Sons and daughters of wealthy men,\nand others who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in\nthe hands of one who did not acquire it gradually, is often fatal to\nsuccess. QUICK RICHES are more dangerous than poverty.\n\n27. INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY. There is no substitute for\nhonesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of\ncircumstances over which one has no control, without permanent\ndamage. But, there is NO HOPE for the person who is dishonest by\nchoice. Sooner or later, his deeds will catch up with him, and he\nwill pay by loss of reputation, and perhaps even loss of liberty.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n124\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

These qualities serve as red\nlights which warn others to keep away. THEY ARE FATAL TO\nSUCCESS.\n\n29. GUESSING INSTEAD OF THINKING. Most people are\ntoo indifferent or lazy to acquire FACTS with which to THINK\nACCURATELY. They prefer to act on \"opinions\" created by\nguesswork or snap-judgments.\n\n30. LACK OF CAPITAL. This is a common cause of failure\namong those who start out in business for the first time, without\nsufficient reserve of capital to absorb the shock of their mistakes,\nand to carry them over until they have established a\nREPUTATION.\n\n31. Under this, name any particular cause of failure from\nwhich you have suffered that has not been included in the\nforegoing list.\n\nIn these thirty major causes of failure is found a description of the tragedy\nof life, which obtains for practically every person who tries and fails. It will be\nhelpful if you can induce someone who knows you well to go over this list with\nyou, and help to analyze you by the thirty causes of failure. It may be beneficial if\nyou try this alone. Most people cannot see themselves as others see them. You\nmay be one who cannot.\n\nThe oldest of admonitions is \"Man, know thyself!\" If you market\nmerchandise successfully, you must know the merchandise. The same is true in\nmarketing personal services. You should know all of your weaknesses in order\nthat you may either bridge them or eliminate them entirely. You should know\nyour strength in order that you may call attention to it when selling your\nservices. You can know yourself only through accurate analysis.\n\nThe folly of ignorance in connection with self was displayed by a young\nman who applied to the manager of a well known business for a position. He\nmade a very good impression until the manager asked him what salary he\nexpected. He replied that he had no fixed sum in mind (lack of a definite aim). The\nmanager then said, \"We will pay you all you are worth, alter we try you out for a\nweek.\"\n\n\"I will not accept it,\" the applicant replied, \"because I AM GETTING\nMORE THAN THAT WHERE I AM NOW EMPLOYED.\"\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n125\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Many people mistake their\nWANTS for their JUST DUES. Your financial requirements or wants have\nnothing whatever to do with your WORTH. Your value is established entirely by\nyour ability to render useful service or your capacity to induce others to render\nsuch service.\n\nTAKE INVENTORY OF YOURSELF\n28 QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ANSWER\n\nAnnual self-analysis is an essential in the effective marketing of personal\nservices, as is annual inventory in merchandising. Moreover, the yearly analysis\nshould disclose a DECREASE IN FAULTS, and an increase in VIRTUES. One\ngoes ahead, stands still, or goes backward in life. One's object should be, of\ncourse, to go ahead. Annual self-analysis will disclose whether advancement has\nbeen, made, and if so, how much. It will also disclose any backward steps one\nmay have made. The effective marketing of personal services requires one to\nmove forward even if the progress is slow.\n\nYour annual self-analysis should be made at the end of each year, so you\ncan include in your New Year's Resolutions any improvements which the\nanalysis indicates should be made. Take this inventory by asking yourself the\nfollowing questions, and by checking your answers with the aid of someone who\nwill not permit you to deceive yourself as to their accuracy.\n\nSELF-ANALYSIS QUESTIONNAIRE FOR\n\nPERSONAL INVENTORY\n\n1.

In this chapter will be found an adequate description of every principle\nessential in planning the sale of personal services, including the major attributes\nof leadership; the most common causes of failure in leadership; a description of\nthe fields of opportunity for leadership; the main causes of failure in all walks of\nlife, and the important questions which should be used in self-analysis. This\nextensive and detailed presentation of accurate information has been included,\nbecause it will be needed by all who must begin the accumulation of riches by\nmarketing personal services. Those who have lost their fortunes, and those who\nare just beginning to earn money, have nothing but personal services to offer in\nreturn for riches, therefore it is essential that they have available the practical\ninformation needed to market services to best advantage.\n\nThe information contained in this chapter will be of great value to all who\naspire to attain leadership in any calling. It will be particularly helpful to those\naiming to market their services as business or industrial executives.\n\nComplete assimilation and understanding of the information here\nconveyed will be helpful in marketing one's own services, and it will also help\none to become more analytical and capable of judging people.

That might be both\ninteresting and profitable, even though you do not doubt the soundness of the\nstatement.\n\nWHERE AND HOW ONE MAY FIND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nTO ACCUMULATE RICHES\n\nNow that we have analyzed the principles by which riches may be\naccumulated, we naturally ask, \"where may one find favorable opportunities to\napply these principles?\" Very well, let us take inventory and see what the United\nStates of America offer the person seeking riches, great or small.\n\nTo begin with, let us remember, all of us, that we live in a country where\n_every law-abiding citizen enjoys freedom of thought and freedom of deed unequaled_\n_anywhere in the world. Most of us have never taken inventory of the advantages of_\nthis freedom. We have never compared our unlimited freedom with the curtailed\nfreedom in other countries.\n\nHere we have freedom of thought, freedom in the choice and enjoyment of\neducation, freedom in religion, freedom in politics, freedom in the choice of a\nbusiness, profession or occupation, freedom to accumulate and own without\nmolestation, ALL\n\n_THE PROPERTY WE CAN ACCUMULATE, freedom to choose our place_\nof residence, freedom in marriage, freedom through equal opportunity to all\nraces, freedom of travel from one state to another, freedom in our choice of foods,\nand freedom\n\nto AIM FOR ANY STATION IN LIFE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PREPARED\n_OURSELVES, even for the presidency of the United States._\n\nWe have other forms of freedom, but this list will give a bird's eye view of\nthe most important, which constitute OPPORTUNITY of the highest order. This\nadvantage of freedom is all the more conspicuous because the United States is\nthe only country guaranteeing to every citizen, whether native born or\nnaturalized, so broad and varied a list of freedom.\n\nNext, let us recount some of the blessings which our widespread freedom\nhas placed within our hands. Take the average American family for example\n(meaning, the family of average income) and sum up the benefits available to\nevery member of the family, in this land of OPPORTUNITY and plenty!\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n129\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Next to freedom of thought and deed comes FOOD,\nCLOTHING, and SHELTER, the three basic necessities of life.\n\nBecause of our universal freedom the average American family has\navailable, at its very door, the choicest selection of food to be found\nanywhere in the world, and at prices within its financial range.\n\nA family of two, living in the heart of Times Square district of New\nYork City, far removed from the source of production of foods, took\ncareful inventory of the cost of a simple breakfast, with this astonishing\nresult:\n\nArticles of food; Cost at the breakfast table:\nGrape Fruit Juice, (From Florida) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02\nRippled Wheat Breakfast food (Kansas Farm). . . . . . . . . 02\nTea (From China). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 02\nBananas (From South America) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .02½\nToasted Bread (From Kansas Farm) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .01\nFresh Country Eggs (From Utah) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .07\nSugar (From Cuba, or Utah) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 00½\nButter and Cream (From New England) . . . . . . . . . . . . .03\n\nGrand total . . . . . .20\n\nIt is not very difficult to obtain FOOD in a country where two people can\nhave breakfast consisting of all they want or need for a dime apiece! Observe that\nthis simple breakfast was gathered, by some strange form of magic (?) from\nChina, South America, Utah, Kansas and the New England States, and delivered\non the breakfast table, ready for consumption, in the very heart of the most\ncrowded city in America, at a cost well within the means of the most humble\nlaborer.\n\nThe cost included all federal, state and city taxes! (Here is a fact the\npoliticians did not mention when they were crying out to the voters to throw\ntheir opponents out of office because the people were being taxed to death).\n\nb. SHELTER. This family lives in a comfortable apartment, heated\nby steam, lighted with electricity, with gas for cooking, all for $65.00 a\nmonth. In a smaller city, or a more sparsely settled part of New York city,\nthe same apartment could be had for as low as $20.00 a month.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n130\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Hot &nd cold water is\navailable, at all times, in the kitchen and the bathroom. The food is kept\ncool in a refrigerator that is run by electricity. The wife curls her hair,\nwashes her clothes and irons them with easily operated electrical\nequipment, on power obtained by sticking a plug in the wall. The husband\nshaves with an electric shaver, and they receive entertainment from all\nover the world, twenty four hours a day, if they want it, without cost, by\nmerely turning the dial of their radio.\n\nThere are other conveniences in this apartment, but the foregoing\nlist will give a fair idea of some of the concrete evidences of the freedom\nwe, of America, enjoy. (And this is neither political nor economic\npropaganda).\n\nc. CLOTHING. Anywhere in the United States, the woman of\naverage clothing requirements can dress very comfortably and neatly for\nless than $200.00 a year, and the average man can dress for the same, or\nless.\n\nOnly the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter have been\nmentioned. The average American citizen has other privileges and advantages\navailable in return for modest effort, not exceeding eight hours per day of labor.\nAmong these is the privilege of automobile transportation, with which one can\ngo and come at will, at very small cost.\n\nThe average American has security of property rights not found in any\nother country in the world. He can place his surplus money in a bank with the\nassurance that his government will protect it, and make good to him if the bank\nfails. If an American citizen wants to travel from one state to another he needs no\npassport, no one's permission. He may go when he pleases, and return at will.\nMoreover, he may travel by train, private automobile, bus, airplane, or ship, as\nhis pocketbook permits. In Germany, Russia, Italy, and most of the other\nEuropean and Oriental countries, the people cannot travel with so much\nfreedom, and at so little cost.\n\nTHE \"MIRACLE\" THAT HAS PROVIDED\n\nTHESE BLESSINGS\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n131\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

They pioneer, experiment, and blaze trails in new fields of\nendeavor. They support colleges, hospitals, public schools, build good roads,\npublish newspapers, pay most of the cost of government, and take care of the\nmultitudinous detail essential to human progress. Stated briefly, the capitalists\nare the brains of civilization, because they supply the entire fabric of which all\neducation, enlightenment and human progress consists.\n\nMoney, without brains, always is dangerous. Properly used, it is the most\nimportant essential of civilization. The simple breakfast here described could not\nhave been delivered to the New York family at a dime each, or at any other price, if\norganized capital had not provided the machinery, the ships, the railroads, and\nthe huge armies of trained men to operate them.\n\nSome slight idea of the importance of ORGANIZED CAPITAL may be\nhad by trying to imagine yourself burdened with the responsibility of collecting,\nwithout the aid of capital, and delivering to the New York City family, the\nsimple breakfast described.\n\nTo supply the tea, you would have to make a trip to China or India, both a\nvery long way from America.

Then, too, another problem\nwould confront you. What would you use for money, even if you had the\nphysical endurance to swim the ocean?\n\nTo supply the sugar, you would have to take another long swim to Cuba,\nor a long walk to the sugar beet section of Utah. But even then, you might come\nback without the sugar, because organized effort and money are necessary to\nproduce sugar, to say nothing of what is required to refine, transport, and deliver\nit to the breakfast table anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe eggs, you could deliver easily enough from the barn yards near New\nYork City, but you would have a very long walk to Florida and return, before\nyou could serve the two glasses of grapefruit juice.\n\nYou would have another long walk, to Kansas, or one of the other wheat\ngrowing states, when you went after the four slices of wheat bread.\n\nThe Rippled Wheat Biscuits would have to be omitted from the menu,\nbecause they would not be available except through the labor of a trained\norganization of men and suitable machinery, ALL OF WHICH CALL FOR\nCAPITAL.\n\nWhile resting, you could take off for another little swim down to South\nAmerica, where you would pick up a couple of bananas, and on your return, you\ncould take a short walk to the nearest farm having a dairy and pick up some\nbutter and cream. Then your New York City family would be ready to sit down\nand enjoy breakfast, and you could collect your two dimes for your labor!\n\nSeems absurd, doesn't it? Well, the procedure described would be the only\npossible way these simple items of food could be delivered to the heart of New\nYork City, if we had no capitalistic system.\n\nThe sum of money required for the building and maintenance of the\nrailroads and steam ships used in the delivery of that simple breakfast is so huge\nthat it staggers one's imagination. It runs into hundreds of millions of dollars, not\nto mention the armies of trained employees required to man the ships and trains.\nBut, transportation is only a part of the requirements of modern civilization in\ncapitalistic America. Before there can be anything to haul, something must be\ngrown from the ground, or manufactured and prepared for market. This calls for\nmore millions of dollars for equipment, machinery, boxing, marketing, and for\nthe wages of millions of men and women.\n\nSteam ships and railroads do not spring up from the earth and function\nautomatically. They come in response to the call of civilization, through the labor\nand ingenuity and organizing ability of men who have IMAGINATION, FAITH,\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n133\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

These men are known as capitalists.\nThey are motivated by the desire to build, construct, achieve, render useful\nservice, earn profits and accumulate riches. And, because they RENDER\nSERVICE WITHOUT WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO CIVILIZATION, they put\nthemselves in the way of great riches.\n\nJust to keep the record simple and understandable, I will add that these\ncapitalists are the self-same men of whom most of us have heard soap-box\norators speak. They are the same men to whom radicals, racketeers, dishonest\npoliticians and grafting labor leaders refer as \"the predatory interests,\" or \"Wall\nStreet.\"\n\nI am not attempting to present a brief for or against any group of men or\nany system of economics. I am not attempting to condemn collective bargaining\nwhen I refer to \"grafting labor leaders,\" nor do I aim to give a clean bill of health\nto all individuals known as capitalists.\n\nThe purpose of this book—A purpose to which I have faithfully devoted over a\n_quarter of a century— is to present to all who want the knowledge, the most_\ndependable philosophy through which individuals may accumulate riches in\nwhatever amounts they desire.\n\nI have here analyzed the economic advantages of the capitalistic system\nfor the two-fold purpose of showing:\n\n1. that all who seek riches must recognize and adapt themselves to the\nsystem that controls all approaches to fortunes, large or small, and\n\n2. to present the side of the picture opposite to that being shown by\npoliticians and demagogues who deliberately becloud the issues they bring up,\nby referring to organized capital as if it were something poisonous.\n\nThis is a capitalistic country, it was developed through the use of capital,\nand we who claim the right to partake of the blessings of freedom and\nopportunity, we who seek to accumulate riches here, may as well know that\nneither riches nor opportunity would be available to us if ORGANIZED\nCAPITAL had not provided these benefits.\n\nFor more than twenty years it has been a somewhat popular and growing\npastime for radicals, self-seeking politicians, racketeers, crooked labor leaders,\nand on occasion religious leaders, to take pot-shots at \"WALL STREET, THE\nMONEY CHANGERS, and BIG BUSINESS.\"\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n134\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The line-up was so general and so well organized that it prolonged the\nworst depression America has ever known. It cost millions of men their jobs,\nbecause those jobs were inseparably a part of the industrial and capitalistic\nsystem which form the very backbone of the nation.\n\nDuring this unusual alliance of government officials and self-seeking\nindividuals who were endeavoring to profit by declaring \"open season\" on the\nAmerican system of industry, a certain type of labor leader joined forces with the\npoliticians and offered to deliver voters in return for legislation designed to\npermit men to TAKE RICHES AWAY FROM INDUSTRY BY ORGANIZED\nFORCE OF NUMBERS, INSTEAD OF THE BETTER METHOD OF GIVING A\nFAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A FAIR DAY'S PAY.\n\nMillions of men and women throughout the nation are still engaged in\nthis popular pastime of trying to GET without GIVING. Some of them are lined\nup with labor unions, where they demand SHORTER HOURS AND MORE PAY!\nOthers do not take the trouble to work at all. THEY DEMAND GOVERNMENT\nRELIEF AND ARE GETTING IT. Their idea of their rights of freedom was\ndemonstrated in New York City, where violent complaint was registered with\nthe Postmaster, by a group of \"relief beneficiaries,\" because the Postmen\nawakened them at 7: 30 A.

They\nDEMANDED that the time of delivery be set up to 10: 00 o'clock.\n\nIf you are one of those who believe that riches can be accumulated by the\nmere act of men who organize themselves into groups and demand MORE PAY\nfor LESS SERVICE, if you are one of those who DEMAND Government relief\nwithout early morning disturbance when the money is delivered to you, if you\nare one of those who believe in trading their votes to politicians in return for the\npassing of laws which permit the raiding of the public treasury, you may rest\nsecurely on your belief, with certain knowledge that no one will disturb you,\nbecause THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY WHERE EVERY MAN MAY THINK AS HE\nPLEASES, where nearly everybody can live with but little effort, where many\nmay live well without doing any work whatsoever.\n\nHowever, you should know the full truth concerning this FREEDOM of\nwhich so many people boast, and so few understand.

Moreover, IT\nHAS AN ALL-SEEING EYE, AND A PERFECT SYSTEM OF BOOKKEEPING, in\nwhich it keeps an accurate account of the transactions of every human being\nengaged in the business of trying to get without giving. Sooner or later its\nauditors come around, look over the records of individuals both great and small,\nand demand an accounting.\n\n\"Wall Street, Big Business, Capital Predatory Interests,\" or whatever name\nyou choose to give the system which has given us AMERICAN FREEDOM,\nrepresents a group of men who understand, respect, and adapt themselves to this\npowerful LAW OF ECONOMICS! Their financial continuation depends upon\ntheir respecting the law.\n\nMost people living in America like this country, its capitalistic system and\nall. I must confess I know of no better country, where one may find greater\nopportunities to accumulate riches. Judging by their acts and deeds, there are\nsome in this country who do not like it. That, of course is their privilege; if they\ndo not like this country, its capitalistic system, its boundless opportunities, THEY\n_HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CLEARING OUT! Always there are other countries,_\nsuch as Germany, Russia, and Italy, where one may try one's hand at enjoying\nfreedom, and accumulating riches providing one is not too particular.\n\nAmerica provides all the freedom and all the opportunity to accumulate\nriches that any honest person may require. When one goes hunting for game, one\nselects hunting grounds where game is plentiful. When seeking riches, the same\nrule would naturally obtain.\n\nIf it is riches you are seeking, do not overlook the possibilities of a country\nwhose citizens are so rich that women, alone, spend over two hundred million\ndollars annually for lip-sticks, rouge and cosmetics.

Only a few of the luxuries and non-essentials have\nbeen mentioned. But, remember that the business of producing, transporting,\nand marketing these few items of merchandise gives regular employment to\nMANY MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN, who receive for their services\nMANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MONTHLY, and spend it freely for both the\nluxuries and the necessities.\n\nEspecially remember, that back of all this exchange of merchandise and\npersonal services may be found an abundance of OPPORTUNITY to accumulate\nriches.

If one has superior talent, training, experience, one may\naccumulate riches in large amounts. Those not so fortunate may accumulate\nsmaller amounts.

There is no Supreme\nCourt to which violators of this law may appeal. The law hands out both\npenalties for its violation, and appropriate rewards for its observance, without\ninterference or the possibility of interference by any human being. The law\ncannot be repealed. It is as fixed as the stars in the heavens, and subject to, and a\npart of the same system that controls the stars.\n\nMay one refuse to adapt one's self to the LAW OF ECONOMICS?\nCertainly! This is a free country, where all men are born with equal rights,\nincluding the privilege of ignoring the LAW OF ECONOMICS.\n\nWhat happens then?\nWell, nothing happens until large numbers of men join forces for the\navowed purpose of ignoring the law, and taking what they want by force.\n\n_THEN COMES THE DICTATOR, WITH WELL ORGANIZED FIRING_\n_SQUADS AND MACHINE GUNS!_\n\nWe have not yet reached that stage in America!

You cannot digest the contents properly\nin a week or a month.\n\nAfter reading the book thoroughly, Dr. Miller Reese Hutchison, nationally\nknown Consulting Engineer and long-time associate of Thomas A. Edison, said—\n\"This is not a novel. It is a textbook on individual achievement that came directly\nfrom the experiences of hundreds of America's most successful men. It should be\n_studied, digested, and meditated upon. No more than one chapter should be read_\nin a single night. The reader should underline the sentences which impress him\nmost. Later, he should go back to these marked lines and read them again. A real\n_student will not merely read this book, he will absorb its contents and make them his_\nown. This book should be adopted by all high schools and no boy or girl should\nbe permitted to graduate without having satisfactorily passed an examination on\nit. This philosophy will not take the place of the subjects taught in schools, but it\nwill enable one to organize and apply the knowledge acquired, and convert it into\nuseful service and adequate compensation without waste of time.\n\nDr. John R. Turner, Dean of the College of The City of New York, after\nhaving read the book, said— \"The very best example of the soundness of this\nphilosophy is your own son, Blair, whose dramatic story you have outlined in\nthe chapter on Desire.\"\n\nDr. Turner had reference to the author's son, who, born without normal\nhearing capacity, not only avoided becoming a deaf mute, but actually converted\nhis handicap into a priceless asset by applying the philosophy here described.\nAfter reading the story (starting on page 52), you will realize that you are about\nto come into possession of a philosophy which can be transmuted into material\nwealth, or serve as readily to bring you peace of mind, understanding, spiritual\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n4\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

When they had problems to be solved they\nsat down together and talked freely until they discovered, from their joint\ncontribution of ideas, a plan that would serve their purpose.\n\nYou, who read this book, will get most out of it by putting into practice\nthe Master Mind principle described in the book. This you can do (as others are\ndoing so successfully) by forming a study club, consisting of any desired number\nof people who are friendly and harmonious. The club should have a meeting at\nregular periods, as often as once each week. The procedure should consist of\nreading one chapter of the book at each meeting, after which the contents of the\nchapter should be freely discussed by all members. Each member should make\nnotes, putting down ALL IDEAS OF HIS OWN inspired by the discussion. Each\nmember should carefully read and analyze each chapter several days prior to its\nopen reading and joint discussion in the club. The reading at the club should be\ndone by someone who reads well and understands how to put color and feeling\ninto the lines.\n\nBy following this plan every reader will get from its pages, not only the\nsum total of the best knowledge organized from the experiences of hundreds of\nsuccessful men, but more important by far, he will tap new sources of knowledge in\n_his own mind as well as acquire knowledge of priceless value FROM EVERY OTHER_\n_PERSON PRESENT._\n\nIf you follow this plan persistently you will be almost certain to uncover\nand appropriate the secret formula by which Andrew Carnegie acquired his\nhuge fortune, as referred to in the author's introduction.\n\nTRIBUTES TO THE AUTHOR\nFrom Great American Leaders\n\n\"THINK AND GROW RICH\" was 25 years in the making.

It constitutes a rich soil in which the seeds of failure grow abundantly. It is\nso subtle that its presence often is not detected. This affliction cannot properly be\nclassed as a fear. IT IS MORE DEEPLY SEATED AND MORE OFTEN FATAL\nTHAN ALL OF THE SIX FEARS. For want of a better name, let us call this evil\nSUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEGATIVE INFLUENCES.\n\nMen who accumulate great riches always protect themselves against this\nevil! The poverty stricken never do! Those who succeed in any calling must\nprepare their minds to resist the evil. If you are reading this philosophy for the\npurpose of accumulating riches, you should examine yourself very carefully, to\ndetermine whether you are susceptible to negative influences. If you neglect this\nself-analysis, you will forfeit your right to attain the object of your desires.\n\nMake the analysis searching. After you read the questions prepared for\nthis self-analysis, hold yourself to a strict accounting in your answers. Go at the\ntask as carefully as you would search for any other enemy you knew to be\nawaiting you in ambush and deal with your own faults as you would with a\nmore tangible enemy.\n\nYou can easily protect yourself against highway robbers, because the law\nprovides organized cooperation for your benefit, but the \"seventh basic evil\" is\nmore difficult to master, because it strikes when you are not aware of its\npresence, when you are asleep, and while you are awake. Moreover, its weapon\nis intangible, because it consists of merely— a STATE OF MIND. This evil is also\ndangerous because it strikes in as many different forms as there are human\nexperiences. Sometimes it enters the mind through the well-meant words of one's\nown relatives. At other times, it bores from within, through one's own mental\nattitude.

This is one decision you\ncannot avoid.\n\nIf you demand riches, determine what form, and how much will be\nrequired to satisfy you. You know the road that leads to riches. You have been\ngiven a road map which, if followed, will keep you on that road. If you neglect to\nmake the start, or stop before you arrive, no one will be to blame, but YOU. This\nresponsibility is yours. No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility if\nyou now fail or refuse to demand riches of Life, because the acceptance calls for\nbut one thing— incidentally, the only thing you can control—and that is a STATE\nOF MIND. A state of mind is something that one assumes. It cannot be\npurchased, it must be created.\n\nFear of poverty is a state of mind, nothing else! But it is sufficient to\ndestroy one's chances of achievement in any undertaking, a truth which became\npainfully evident during the depression.\n\nThis fear paralyzes the faculty of reason, destroys the faculty of\nimagination, kills off self-reliance, undermines enthusiasm, discourages\ninitiative, leads to uncertainty of purpose, encourages procrastination, wipes out\nenthusiasm and makes self-control an impossibility. It takes the charm from one's\npersonality, destroys the possibility of accurate thinking, diverts concentration of\neffort, it masters persistence, turns the will-power into nothingness, destroys\nambition, beclouds the memory and invites failure in every conceivable form; it\nkills love and assassinates the finer emotions of the heart, discourages friendship\nand invites disaster in a hundred forms, leads to sleeplessness, misery and\nunhappiness— and all this despite the obvious truth that we live in a world of\nover-abundance of everything the heart could desire, with nothing standing\nbetween us and our desires, excepting lack of a definite purpose.\n\nThe Fear of Poverty is, without doubt, the most destructive of the six basic\nfears. It has been placed at the head of the list, because it is the most difficult to\nmaster. Considerable courage is required to state the truth about the origin of\nthis fear, and still greater courage to accept the truth after it has been stated. The\nfear of poverty grew out of man's inherited tendency to PREY UPON HIS\nFELLOW MAN ECONOMICALLY. Nearly all animals lower than man are\nmotivated by instinct, but their capacity to \"think\" is limited, therefore, they prey\nupon one another physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, with the\ncapacity to think and to reason, does not eat his fellowman bodily, he gets more\nsatisfaction out of \"eating\" him FINANCIALLY. Man is so avaricious that every\nconceivable law has been passed to safeguard him from his fellowman.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n221\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

A\nman is considered less than the dust of the earth, unless he can display a fat bank\naccount; but if he has money— NEVER MIND HOW HE ACQUIRED IT— he is a\n\"king\" or a \"big shot\"; he is above the law, he rules in politics, he dominates in\nbusiness, and the whole world about him bows in respect when he passes.\n\nNothing brings man so much suffering and humility as POVERTY! Only\nthose who have experienced poverty understand the full meaning of this.\n\nIt is no wonder that man fears poverty. Through a long line of inherited\nexperiences man has learned, for sure, that some men cannot be trusted, where\nmatters of money and earthly possessions are concerned. This is a rather stinging\nindictment, the worst part of it being that it is TRUE.\n\nThe majority of marriages are motivated by the wealth possessed by one,\nor both of the contracting parties. It is no wonder, therefore, that the divorce\ncourts are busy.\n\nSo eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever\nmanner he can— through legal methods if possible— through other methods if\nnecessary or expedient.\n\nSelf-analysis may disclose weaknesses which one does not like to\nacknowledge. This form of examination is essential to all who demand of Life\nmore than mediocrity and poverty. Remember, as you check yourself point by\npoint, that you are both the court and the jury, the prosecuting attorney and the\nattorney for the defense, and that you are the plaintiff and the defendant, also,\nthat you are on trial. Face the facts squarely. Ask yourself definite questions and\ndemand direct replies. When the examination is over, you will know more about\nyourself. If you do not feel that you can be an impartial judge in this selfexamination, call upon someone who knows you well to serve as judge while\nyou cross-examine yourself. You are after the truth. Get it, no matter at what cost\n_even though it may temporarily embarrass you!_\n\nThe majority of people, if asked what they fear most, would reply, \"I fear\nnothing.\" The reply would be inaccurate, because few people realize that they are\nbound, handicapped, whipped spiritually and physically through some form of\nfear. So subtle and deeply seated is the emotion of fear that one may go through\nlife burdened with it, never recognizing its presence. Only a courageous analysis\nwill disclose the presence of this universal enemy. When you begin such an\nanalysis, search deeply into your character.

Commonly expressed through lack of ambition; willingness to\ntolerate poverty; acceptance of whatever compensation life may offer without\nprotest; mental and physical laziness; lack of initiative, imagination, enthusiasm\nand self-control\n\nINDECISION. The habit of permitting others to do one's thinking. Staying \"on\nthe fence.\"\n\nDOUBT. Generally expressed through alibis and excuses designed to cover up,\nexplain away, or apologize for one's failures, sometimes expressed in the form of\nenvy of those who are successful, or by criticising them.\n\nWORRY. Usually expressed by finding fault with others, a tendency to spend\nbeyond one's income, neglect of personal appearance, scowling and frowning;\nintemperance in the use of alcoholic drink, sometimes through the use of\nnarcotics; nervousness, lack of poise, self-consciousness and lack of self-reliance.\n\nOVER-CAUTION. The habit of looking for the negative side of every\ncircumstance, thinking and talking of possible failure instead of concentrating\nupon the means of succeeding. Knowing all the roads to disaster, but never\nsearching for the plans to avoid failure. Waiting for \"the right time\" to begin\nputting ideas and plans into action, until the waiting becomes a permanent habit.\nRemembering those who have failed, and forgetting those who have succeeded.\nSeeing the hole in the doughnut, but overlooking the doughnut. Pessimism,\nleading to indigestion, poor elimination, auto-intoxication, bad breath and bad\ndisposition.\n\nPROCRASTINATION. The habit of putting off until tomorrow that which should\nhave been done last year. Spending enough time in creating alibis and excuses to\nhave done the job. This symptom is closely related to over-caution, doubt and\nworry. Refusal to accept responsibility when it can be avoided. Willingness to\ncompromise rather than put up a stiff fight. Compromising with difficulties\ninstead of harnessing and using them as stepping stones to advancement.\nBargaining with Life for a penny, instead of demanding prosperity, opulence,\nriches, contentment and happiness.

Weakness of, and often total lack of selfconfidence, definiteness of purpose, self-control, initiative, enthusiasm, ambition,\nthrift and sound reasoning ability. EXPECTING POVERTY INSTEAD OF\nDEMANDING RICHES. Association with those who accept poverty instead of\nseeking the company of those who demand and receive riches.\n\nMONEY TALKS!\n\nSome will ask, \"why did you write a book about money? Why measure\nriches in dollars, alone?\" Some will believe, and rightly so, that there are other\nforms of riches more desirable than money. Yes, there are riches which cannot be\nmeasured in terms of dollars, but there are millions of people who will say, \"Give\nme all the money I need, and I will find everything else I want.\"\n\nThe major reason why I wrote this book on how to get money is the fact\nthat the world has but lately passed through an experience that left millions of\nmen and women paralyzed with the FEAR OF POVERTY. What this sort of fear\ndoes to one was well described by Westbrook Pegler, in the New York WorldTelegram, viz:\n\n\"Money is only clam shells or metal discs or scraps of paper, and there are\ntreasures of the heart and soul which money cannot buy, but most people, being\nbroke, are unable to keep this in mind and sustain their spirits. When a man is\ndown and out and on the street, unable to get any job at all, something happens\nto his spirit which can be observed in the droop of his shoulders, the set of his\nhat, his walk and his gaze. He cannot escape a feeling of inferiority among\npeople with regular employment, even though he knows they are definitely not\nhis equals in character, intelligence or ability.\n\n\"These people—even his friends—feel, on the other hand, a sense of\nsuperiority and regard him, perhaps unconsciously, as a casualty. He may\nborrow for a time, but not enough to carry on in his accustomed way, and he\ncannot continue to borrow very long. But borrowing in itself, when a man is\nborrowing merely to live, is a depressing experience, and the money lacks the\npower of earned money to revive his spirits. Of course, none of this applies to\nbums or habitual ne'er-do-wells, but only to men of normal ambitions and selfrespect.\n\n\"WOMEN CONCEAL DESPAIR.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n224\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

We somehow do not\nthink of women at all in considering the down-and-outers. They are scarce in the\nbreadlines, they rarely are seen begging on the streets, and they are not\nrecognizable in crowds by the same plain signs which identify busted men. Of\ncourse, I do not mean the shuffling hags of the city streets who are the opposite\nnumber of the confirmed male bums. I mean reasonably young, decent and\nintelligent women. There must be many of them, but their despair is not\napparent. Maybe they kill themselves.\n\n\"When a man is down and out he has time on his hands for brooding. He\nmay travel miles to see a man about a job and discover that the job is filled or\nthat it is one of those jobs with no base pay but only a commission on the sale of\nsome useless knick-knack which nobody would buy, except out of pity. Turning\nthat down, he finds himself back on the street with nowhere to go but just\nanywhere. So he walks and walks. He gazes into store windows at luxuries\nwhich are not for him, and feels inferior and gives way to people who stop to\nlook with an active interest. He wanders into the railroad station or puts himself\ndown in the library to ease his legs and soak up a little heat, but that isn't looking\nfor a job, so he gets going again. He may not know it, but his aimlessness would\ngive him away even if the very lines of his figure did not. He may be well\ndressed in the clothes left over from the days when he had a steady job, but the\nclothes cannot disguise the droop.\n\n\"MONEY MAKES DIFFERENCE.\n\n\"He sees thousands of other people, bookkeepers or clerks or chemists or\nwagon hands, busy at their work and envies them from the bottom of his soul.\nThey have their independence, their self-respect and manhood, and he simply\ncannot convince himself that he is a good man, too, though he argue it out and\narrive at a favorable verdict hour after hour.\n\n\"It is just money which makes this difference in him. With a little money\nhe would be himself again.\n\n\"Some employers take the most shocking advantage of people who are\ndown and out. The agencies hang out little colored cards offering miserable\nwages to busted men—$ 12 a week, $15 a week.

It can be assimilated,\nunderstood, and applied ONLY by first mastering the other twelve principles.\n\nThe SIXTH SENSE is that portion of the subconscious mind which has\nbeen referred to as the Creative Imagination. It has also been referred to as the\n\"receiving set\" through which ideas, plans, and thoughts flash into the mind. The\n\"flashes\" are sometimes called \"hunches\" or \"inspirations.\"\n\nThe sixth sense defies description! It cannot be described to a person who\nhas not mastered the other principles of this philosophy, because such a person\nhas no knowledge, and no experience with which the sixth sense may be\ncompared. Understanding of the sixth sense comes only by meditation through\nmind development from within. The sixth sense probably is the medium of\ncontact between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence, and for this\nreason, it is a mixture of both the mental and the spiritual. It is believed to be the\npoint at which the mind of man contacts the Universal Mind.\n\nAfter you have mastered the principles described in this book, you will be\nprepared to accept as truth a statement which may, otherwise, be incredible to\nyou, namely:\n\nThrough the aid of the sixth sense, you will be warned of impending\ndangers in time to avoid them, and notified of opportunities in time to embrace\nthem.\n\nThere comes to your aid, and to do your bidding, with the development of\nthe sixth sense, a \"guardian angel\" who will open to you at all times the door to\nthe Temple of Wisdom.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n208\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Some of her laws are so incomprehensible that_\nthey produce what appear to be \"miracles.\" The sixth sense comes as near to\nbeing a miracle as anything I have ever experienced, and it appears so, only\nbecause I do not understand the method by which this principle is operated.\n\nThis much the author does know— that there is a power, or a First Cause,\nor an Intelligence, which permeates every atom of matter, and embraces every\nunit of energy perceptible to man— that this Infinite Intelligence converts acorns\ninto oak trees, causes water to flow down hill in response to the law of gravity,\nfollows night with day, and winter with summer, each maintaining its proper\nplace and relationship to the other. This Intelligence may, through the principles\nof this philosophy, be induced to aid in transmuting DESIRES into concrete, or\nmaterial form. The author has this knowledge, because he has experimented with\nit— and has EXPERIENCED IT.\n\nStep by step, through the preceding chapters, you have been led to this,\nthe last principle. If you have mastered each of the preceding principles, you are\nnow prepared to accept, without being skeptical, the stupendous claims made here.\nIf you have not mastered the other principles, you must do so before you may\ndetermine, definitely, whether or not the claims made in this chapter are fact or\nfiction.\n\nWhile I was passing through the age of \"hero-worship\" I found myself\ntrying to imitate those whom I most admired. Moreover, I discovered that the\nelement of FAITH, with which I endeavored to imitate my idols, gave me great\ncapacity to do so quite successfully.\n\nI have never entirely divested myself of this habit of hero-worship,\nalthough I have passed the age commonly given over to such. My experience has\ntaught me that the next best thing to being truly great, is to emulate the great, by\nfeeling and action, as nearly as possible.\n\nLong before I had ever written a line for publication, or endeavored to\ndeliver a speech in public, I followed the habit of reshaping my own character,\nby trying to imitate the nine men whose lives and life-works had been most\nimpressive to me. These nine men were, Emerson, Paine, Edison, Darwin,\nLincoln, Burbank, Napoleon, Ford, and Carnegie.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n209\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Just before going to sleep at night, I would shut\nmy eyes, and see, in my imagination, this group of men seated with me around\nmy Council Table. Here I had not only an opportunity to sit among those whom I\nconsidered to be great, but I actually dominated the group, by serving as the\nChairman.\n\nI had a very DEFINITE PURPOSE in indulging my imagination through\nthese nightly meetings. My purpose was to rebuild my own character so it would\nrepresent a composite of the characters of my imaginary counselors. Realizing, as\nI did, early in life, that I had to overcome the handicap of birth in an environment\nof ignorance and superstition, I deliberately assigned myself the task of\nvoluntary rebirth through the method here described.\n\nBUILDING CHARACTER THROUGH AUTO-SUGGESTION\n\nBeing an earnest student of psychology, I knew, of course, that all men\nhave become what they are, because of their DOMINATING THOUGHTS AND\nDESIRES. I knew that every deeply seated desire has the effect of causing one to\nseek outward expression through which that desire may be transmuted into\nreality. I knew that self-suggestion is a powerful factor in building character, that\nit is, in fact, the sole principle through which character is builded.\n\nWith this knowledge of the principles of mind operation, I was fairly well\narmed with the equipment needed in rebuilding my character. In these\nimaginary Council meetings I called on my Cabinet members for the knowledge\nI wished each to contribute, addressing myself to each member in audible words,\nas follows:\n\n\"Mr. Emerson, I desire to acquire from you the marvelous understanding\nof Nature which distinguished your life. I ask that you make an impress upon\nmy subconscious mind, of whatever qualities you possessed, which enabled you\nto understand and adapt yourself to the laws of Nature. I ask that you assist me\nin reaching and drawing upon whatever sources of knowledge are available to\nthis end.\n\n\"Mr. Burbank, I request that you pass on to me the knowledge which\nenabled you to so harmonize the laws of Nature that you caused the cactus to\nshed its thorns, and become an edible food.

Also to acquire the spirit of enduring FAITH, which\nenabled you to turn defeat into victory, and to surmount staggering obstacles.\nEmperor of Fate, King of Chance, Man of Destiny, I salute you!\n\n\"Mr. Paine, I desire to acquire from you the freedom of thought and the\ncourage and clarity with which to express convictions, which so distinguished\nyou!\n\n\"Mr. Darwin, I wish to acquire from you the marvelous patience, and\nability to study cause and effect, without bias or prejudice, so exemplified by you\nin the field of natural science.\n\n\"Mr. Lincoln, I desire to build into my own character the keen sense of\njustice, the untiring spirit of patience, the sense of humor, the human\nunderstanding, and the tolerance, which were your distinguishing\ncharacteristics.\n\n\"Mr. Carnegie, I am already indebted to you for my choice of a life-work,\nwhich has brought me great happiness and peace of mind. I wish to acquire a\nthorough understanding of the principles of organized effort, which you used so\neffectively in the building of a great industrial enterprise.\n\n\"Mr. Ford, you have been among the most helpful of the men who have\nsupplied much of the material essential to my work. I wish to acquire your spirit\nof persistence, the determination, poise, and self-confidence which have enabled\nyou to master poverty, organize, unify, and simplify human effort, so I may help\nothers to follow in your footsteps.\n\n\"Mr. Edison, I have seated you nearest to me, at my right, because of the\npersonal cooperation you have given me, during my research into the causes of\nsuccess and failure. I wish to acquire from you the marvelous spirit of FAITH,\nwith which you have uncovered so many of Nature's secrets, the spirit of\nunremitting toil with which you have so often wrested victory from defeat.\"\n\nMy method of addressing the members of the imaginary Cabinet would\nvary, according to the traits of character in which I was, for the moment, most\ninterested in acquiring. I studied the records of their lives with painstaking care.\nAfter some months of this nightly procedure, I was astounded by the discovery\nthat these imaginary figures became, apparently real.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n211\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

For example, Lincoln developed the habit of always being late,\nthen walking around in solemn parade. When he came, he walked very slowly,\nwith his hands clasped behind him, and once in a while, he would stop as he\npassed, and rest his hand, momentarily, upon my shoulder. He always wore an\nexpression of seriousness upon his face. Rarely did I see him smile. The cares of a\nsundered nation made him grave.\n\nThat was not true of the others. Burbank and Paine often indulged in witty\nrepartee which seemed, at times, to shock the other members of the cabinet. One\nnight Paine suggested that I prepare a lecture on \"The Age of Reason,\" and\ndeliver it from the pulpit of a church which I formerly attended. Many around\nthe table laughed heartily at the suggestion. Not Napoleon! He drew his mouth\ndown at the corners and groaned so loudly that all turned and looked at him\nwith amazement. To him the church was but a pawn of the State, not to be\nreformed, but to be used, as a convenient inciter to mass activity by the people.\n\nOn one occasion Burbank was late. When he came, he was excited with\nenthusiasm, and explained that he had been late, because of an experiment he\nwas making, through which he hoped to be able to grow apples on any sort of\ntree. Paine chided him by reminding him that it was an apple which started all\nthe trouble between man and woman. Darwin chuckled heartily as he suggested\nthat Paine should watch out for little serpents, when he went into the forest to\ngather apples, as they had the habit of growing into big snakes. Emerson\nobserved—\" No serpents, no apples,\" and Napoleon remarked, \"No apples, no\nstate!\"\n\nLincoln developed the habit of always being the last one to leave the table\nafter each meeting. On one occasion, he leaned across the end of the table, his\narms folded, and remained in that position for many minutes. I made no attempt\nto disturb him. Finally, he lifted his head slowly, got up and walked to the door,\nthen turned around, came back, and laid his hand on my shoulder and said, \"My\nboy, you will need much courage if you remain steadfast in carrying out your\npurpose in life. But remember, when difficulties overtake you, the common\npeople have common sense. Adversity will develop it.\"\n\nOne evening Edison arrived ahead of all the others. He walked over and\nseated himself at my left, where Emerson was accustomed to sit, and said, \"You\nare destined to witness the discovery of the secret of life. When the time comes,\nyou will observe that life consists of great swarms of energy, or entities, each as\nintelligent as human beings think themselves to be.

These meetings which you are conducting will be\nvery helpful to you. They will bring to your rescue some of the same units of life\nwhich served the members of your Cabinet, during their lives. These units are\neternal. THEY NEVER DIE! Your own thoughts and DESIRES serve as the\nmagnet which attracts units of life, from the great ocean of life out there. Only the\nfriendly units are attracted—the ones which harmonize with the nature of your\nDESIRES.\"\n\nThe other members of the Cabinet began to enter the room. Edison got up,\nand slowly walked around to his own seat. Edison was still living when this\nhappened. It impressed me so greatly that I went to see him, and told him about\nthe experience. He smiled broadly, and said, \"Your dream was more a reality\nthan you may imagine it to have been.\" He added no further explanation to his\nstatement.\n\nThese meetings became so realistic that I became fearful of their\nconsequences, and discontinued them for several months. The experiences were\nso uncanny, I was afraid if I continued them I would lose sight of the fact that the\nmeetings were purely experiences of my imagination.\n\nSome six months after I had discontinued the practice I was awakened one\nnight, or thought I was, when I saw Lincoln standing at my bedside. He said,\n\"The world will soon need your services. It is about to undergo a period of chaos\nwhich will cause men and women to lose faith, and become panic stricken. Go\nahead with your work and complete your philosophy. That is your mission in\nlife. If you neglect it, for any cause whatsoever, you will be reduced to a primal\nstate, and be compelled to retrace the cycles through which you have passed\nduring thousands of years.\n\n\"I was unable to tell, the following morning, whether I had dreamed this,\nor had actually been awake, and I have never since found out which it was, but I\ndo know that the dream, if it were a dream, was so vivid in my mind the next\nday that I resumed my meetings the following night.\n\nAt our next meeting, the members of my Cabinet all filed into the room\ntogether, and stood at their accustomed places at the Council Table, while\nLincoln raised a glass and said, \"Gentlemen, let us drink a toast to a friend who\nhas returned to the fold.\"\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n213\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

I have been emboldened now to reduce my\nexperience to the printed page, because I am now less concerned about what\n\"they say\" than I was in the years that have passed. One of the blessings of\nmaturity is that it sometimes brings one greater courage to be truthful, regardless\nof what those who do not understand, may think or say.\n\nLest I be misunderstood, I wish here to state most emphatically, that I still\nregard my Cabinet meetings as being purely imaginary, but I feel entitled to\nsuggest that, while the members of my Cabinet may be purely fictional, and the\nmeetings existent only in my own imagination, they have led me into glorious\npaths of adventure, rekindled an appreciation of true greatness, encouraged\ncreative endeavor, and emboldened the expression of honest thought.\n\nSomewhere in the cell-structure of the brain, is located an organ which\nreceives vibrations of thought ordinarily called \"hunches.\" So far, science has not\ndiscovered where this organ of the sixth sense is located, but this is not\nimportant. The fact remains that human beings do receive accurate knowledge,\nthrough sources other than the physical senses. Such knowledge, generally, is\nreceived when the mind is under the influence of extraordinary stimulation. Any\nemergency which arouses the emotions, and causes the heart to beat more\nrapidly than normal may, and generally does, bring the sixth sense into action.\nAnyone who has experienced a near accident while driving, knows that on such\noccasions, the sixth sense often comes to one's rescue, and aids, by split seconds,\nin avoiding the accident.\n\nThese facts are mentioned preliminary to a statement of fact which I shall\nnow make, namely, that during my meetings with the \"Invisible Counselors\" I\nfind my mind most receptive to ideas, thoughts, and knowledge which reach me\nthrough the sixth sense. I can truthfully say that I owe entirely to my \"Invisible\nCounselors\" full credit for such ideas, facts, or knowledge as I received through\n\"inspiration.\"\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n214\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

In more recent years, my experimentation has taken on an entirely\ndifferent trend. I now go to my imaginary counselors with every difficult\nproblem which confronts me and my clients. The results are often astonishing,\nalthough I do not depend entirely on this form of Counsel.\n\nYou, of course, have recognized that this chapter covers a subject with\nwhich a majority of people are not familiar. The Sixth Sense is a subject that will\nbe of great interest and benefit to the person whose aim is to accumulate vast\nwealth, but it need not claim the attention of those whose desires are more\nmodest.\n\nHenry Ford, undoubtedly understands and makes practical use of the\nsixth sense. His vast business and financial operations make it necessary for him\nto understand and use this principle. The late Thomas A. Edison understood and\nused the sixth sense in connection with the development of inventions, especially\nthose involving basic patents, in connection with which he had no human\nexperience and no accumulated knowledge to guide him, as was the case while\nhe was working on the talking machine, and the moving picture machine.\n\nNearly all great leaders, such as Napoleon, Bismark, Joan of Arc, Christ,\nBuddha, Confucius, and Mohammed, understood, and probably made use of the\nsixth sense almost continuously. The major portion of their greatness consisted of\ntheir knowledge of this principle.\n\nThe sixth sense is not something that one can take off and put on at will.\nAbility to use this great power comes slowly, through application of the other\nprinciples outlined in this book. Seldom does any individual come into workable\nknowledge of the sixth sense before the age of forty. More often the knowledge is\nnot available until one is well past fifty, and this, for the reason that the spiritual\nforces, with which the sixth sense is so closely related, do not mature and become\nusable except through years of meditation, self-examination, and serious\nthought.\n\nNo matter who you are, or what may have been your purpose in reading\nthis book, you can profit by it without understanding the principle described in\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n215\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This is especially true if your major purpose is that of accumulation\nof money or other material things.\n\nThe chapter on the sixth sense was included, because the book is designed\nfor the purpose of presenting a complete philosophy by which individuals may\nunerringly guide themselves in attaining whatever they ask of life. The starting\npoint of all achievement is DESIRE. The finishing point is that brand of\nKNOWLEDGE which leads to understanding— understanding of self,\nunderstanding of others, understanding of the laws of Nature, recognition and\nunderstanding of HAPPINESS.\n\nThis sort of understanding comes in its fullness only through familiarity\nwith, and use of the principle of the sixth sense, hence that principle had to be\nincluded as a part of this philosophy, for the benefit of those who demand more\nthan money.\n\nHaving read the chapter, you must have observed that while reading it,\nyou were lifted to a high level of mental stimulation. Splendid! Come back to this\nagain a month from now, read it once more, and observe that your mind will\nsoar to a still higher level of stimulation. Repeat this experience from time to\ntime, giving no concern as to how much or how little you learn at the time, and\neventually you will find yourself in possession of a power that will enable you to\nthrow off discouragement, master fear, overcome procrastination, and draw\nfreely upon your imagination. Then you will have felt the touch of that unknown\n\"something\" which has been the moving spirit of every truly great thinker leader,\nartist, musician, writer, statesman. Then you will be in position to transmute\nyour DESIRES into their physical or financial counterpart as easily as you may lie\ndown and quit at the first sign of opposition.\n\nFAITH VS. FEAR!\n\nPrevious chapters have described how to develop FAITH, through Autosuggestion, Desire and the Subconscious. The next chapter presents detailed\ninstructions for the mastery of FEAR.\n\nHere will be found a full description of the six fears which are the cause of\nall discouragement, timidity, procrastination, indifference, indecision, and the\nlack of ambition, self-reliance, initiative, self-control, and enthusiasm.\n\nSearch yourself carefully as you study these six enemies, as they may exist\nonly in your subconscious mind, where their presence will be hard to detect.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n216\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

General knowledge, no matter how great in quantity or variety it\nmay be, is of but little use in the accumulation of money. The faculties of the\ngreat universities possess, in the aggregate, practically every form of general\nknowledge known to civilization. Most of the professors have but little or no money.\nThey specialize on teaching knowledge, but they do not specialize on the\norganization, or the use of knowledge.\n\nKNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and\nintelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE\nEND of accumulation of money. Lack of understanding of this fact has been the\nsource of confusion to millions of people who falsely believe that \"knowledge is\npower.\" It is nothing of the sort! Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes\npower only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and\ndirected to a definite end.\n\nThis \"missing link\" in all systems of education known to civilization today,\nmay be found in the failure of educational institutions to teach their students\nHOW TO ORGANIZE AND USE KNOWLEDGE AFTER THEY ACQUIRE IT.\n\nMany people make the mistake of assuming that, because Henry Ford had\nbut little \"schooling,\" he is not a man of \"education.\" Those who make this\nmistake do not know Henry Ford, nor do they understand the real meaning of\nthe word \"educate.\" That word is derived from the Latin word \"educo,\" meaning\nto educe, to draw out, to DEVELOP FROM WITHIN.\n\nAn educated man is not, necessarily, one who has an abundance of\ngeneral or specialized knowledge. An educated man is one who has so\ndeveloped the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its\nequivalent, without violating the rights of others. Henry Ford comes well within\nthe meaning of this definition.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n73\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

When the suit was tried in the Courts, the attorneys for the paper\npleaded justification, and placed Mr. Ford, himself, on the witness stand, for the\npurpose of proving to the jury that he was ignorant. The attorneys asked Mr.\nFord a great variety of questions, all of them intended to prove, by his own\nevidence, that, while he might possess considerable specialized knowledge\npertaining to the manufacture of automobiles, he was, in the main, ignorant.\n\nMr. Ford was plied with such questions as the following: \"Who was\nBenedict Arnold?\" and \"How many soldiers did the British send over to America\nto put down the Rebellion of 1776?\" In answer to the last question, Mr. Ford\nreplied, \"I do not know the exact number of soldiers the British sent over, but I\nhave heard that it was a considerably larger number than ever went back.\"\n\nFinally, Mr. Ford became tired of this line of questioning, and in reply to a\nparticularly offensive question, he leaned over, pointed his finger at the lawyer\nwho had asked the question, and said, \"If I should really WANT to answer the\nfoolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been\nasking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric push-buttons on my\ndesk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can\nanswer ANY question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am\ndevoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, WHY I should clutter\nup my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer\nquestions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I\nrequire?\"\n\nThere certainly was good logic to that reply.\nThat answer floored the lawyer. Every person in the courtroom realized it\nwas the answer, not of an ignorant man, but of a man of EDUCATION. Any man\nis educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs it, and how to\norganize that knowledge into definite plans of action. Through the assistance of\nhis \"Master Mind\" group, Henry Ford had at his command all the specialized\nknowledge he needed to enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in\nAmerica. It was not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind. Surely no\nperson who has sufficient inclination and intelligence to read a book of this\nnature can possibly miss the significance of this illustration.\n\nBefore you can be sure of your ability to transmute DESIRE into its\nmonetary equivalent, you will require SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n74\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Perhaps you may need much more specialized knowledge than you\nhave the ability or the inclination to acquire, and if this should be true, you may\nbridge your weakness through the aid of your \"Master Mind\" group.\n\nAndrew Carnegie stated that he, personally, knew nothing about the\ntechnical end of the steel business; moreover, he did not particularly care to\nknow anything about it. The specialized knowledge which he required for the\nmanufacture and marketing of steel, he found available through the individual\nunits of his MASTER MIND GROUP.\n\nThe accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is\nacquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized\nknowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the\npossession of the man who accumulates the fortune.\n\nThe preceding paragraph should give hope and encouragement to the\nman with ambition to accumulate a fortune, who has not possessed himself of\nthe necessary \"education\" to supply such specialized knowledge as he may\nrequire. Men sometimes go through life suffering from \"inferiority complexes,\"\nbecause they are not men of \"education.\" The man who can organize and direct a\n\"Master Mind\" group of men who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation\nof money, is just as much a man of education as any man in the group.\nREMEMBER THIS, if you suffer from a feeling of inferiority, because your\nschooling has been limited.\n\nThomas A. Edison had only three months of \"schooling\" during his entire\nlife. He did not lack education, neither did he die poor.\n\nHenry Ford had less than a sixth grade \"schooling\" but he has managed to\ndo pretty well by himself, financially.\n\nSPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE is among the most plentiful, and the\ncheapest forms of service which may be had! If you doubt this, consult the\npayroll of any university.\n\nIT PAYS TO KNOW HOW TO PURCHASE KNOWLEDGE\n\nFirst of all, decide the sort of specialized knowledge you require, and the\npurpose for which it is needed. To a large extent your major purpose in life, the\ngoal toward which you are working, will help determine what knowledge you\nneed.

The more important\nof these are:\n\n(a) One's own experience and education\n(b) Experience and education available through cooperation of others\n(Master Mind Alliance)\n\n(c) Colleges and Universities\n(d) Public Libraries (Through books and periodicals in which may be\nfound all the knowledge organized by civilization)\n\n(e) Special Training Courses (Through night schools and home study\nschools in particular.)\n\nAs knowledge is acquired it must be organized and put into use, for a\ndefinite purpose, through practical plans. Knowledge has no value except that\nwhich can be gained from its application toward some worthy end. This is one\nreason why college degrees are not valued more highly. They represent nothing\nbut miscellaneous knowledge.\n\nIf you contemplate taking additional schooling, first determine the\npurpose for which you want the knowledge you are seeking, then learn where\nthis particular sort of knowledge can be obtained, from reliable sources.\n\nSuccessful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized\nknowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession. Those who are\nnot successful usually make the mistake of believing that the knowledge\nacquiring period ends when one finishes school. The truth is that schooling does\nbut little more than to put one in the way of learning how to acquire practical\nknowledge.\n\nWith this Changed World which began at the end of the economic\ncollapse, came also astounding changes in educational requirements. The order\nof the day is SPECIALIZATION! This truth was emphasized by Robert P. Moore,\nsecretary of appointments of Columbia University.\n\n\"SPECIALISTS MOST SOUGHT\n\n\"Particularly sought after by employing companies are candidates who\nhave specialized in some field— business-school graduates with training in\naccounting and statistics, engineers of all varieties, journalists, architects,\nchemists, and also outstanding leaders and activity men of the senior class.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n76\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

For this reason we emphasize qualities of\ncharacter, intelligence and personality far more than specific educational\nbackground.'\n\n\"APPRENTICESHIP' PROPOSED\n\n\"Proposing a system of 'apprenticing' students in offices, stores and\nindustrial occupations during the summer vacation, Mr. Moore asserts that after\nthe first two or three years of college, every student should be asked 'to choose a\ndefinite future course and to call a halt if he has been merely pleasantly drifting\nwithout purpose through an unspecialized academic curriculum.'\n\n\"Colleges and universities must face the practical consideration that all\nprofessions and occupations now demand specialists,\" he said, urging that\neducational institutions accept more direct responsibility for vocational\nguidance. One of the most reliable and practical sources of knowledge available\nto those who need specialized schooling, is the night schools operated in most\nlarge cities. The correspondence schools give specialized training anywhere the\nU. S. mails go, on all subjects that can be taught by the extension method. One\nadvantage of home study training is the flexibility of the study programme\nwhich permits one to study during spare time. Another stupendous advantage of\nhome study training (if the school is carefully chosen), is the fact that most\ncourses offered by home study schools carry with them generous privileges of\nconsultation which can be of priceless value to those needing specialized\nknowledge. No matter where you live, you can share the benefits.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n77\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The SELF-DISCIPLINE one receives\nfrom a definite programme of specialized study makes up to some extent, for the\nwasted opportunity when knowledge was available without cost.\nCorrespondence schools are highly organized business institutions. Their tuition\nfees are so low that they are forced to insist upon prompt payments. Being asked\nto pay, whether the student makes good grades or poor, has the effect of causing\none to follow through with the course when he would otherwise drop it. The\ncorrespondence schools have not stressed this point sufficiently, for the truth is\nthat their collection departments constitute the very finest sort of training on\nDECISION, PROMPTNESS, ACTION and THE HABIT OF FINISHING THAT\nWHICH ONE BEGINS.\n\nI learned this from experience, more than twenty-five years ago. I enrolled\nfor a home study course in Advertising. After completing eight or ten lessons I\nstopped studying, but the school did not stop sending me bills. Moreover, it\ninsisted upon payment, whether I kept up my studies or not. I decided that if I\nhad to pay for the course (which I had legally obligated myself to do), I should\ncomplete the lessons and get my money's worth. I felt, at the time, that the\ncollection system of the school was somewhat too well organized, but I learned\nlater in life that it was a valuable part of my training for which no charge had\nbeen made. Being forced to pay, I went ahead and completed the course. Later in\nlife I discovered that the efficient collection system of that school had been worth\nmuch in the form of money earned, because of the training in advertising I had\nso reluctantly taken.\n\nWe have in this country what is said to be the greatest public school\nsystem in the world. We have invested fabulous sums for fine buildings, we have\nprovided convenient transportation for children living in the rural districts, so\nthey may attend the best schools, but there is one astounding weakness to this\nmarvelous system— IT IS FREE! One of the strange things about human beings is\nthat they value only that which has a price. The free schools of America, and the\nfree public libraries, do not impress people because they are free. This is the\nmajor reason why so many people find it necessary to acquire additional training\nafter they quit school and go lo work. It is also one of the major reasons why\nEMPLOYERS GIVE GREATER CONSIDERATION TO EMPLOYEES WHO\nTAKE HOME STUDY COURSES. They have learned, from experience, that any\nperson who has the ambition to give up a part of his spare time to studying at\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n78\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This recognition is\nnot a charitable gesture, it is sound business judgment upon the part of the\nemployers.\n\nThere is one weakness in people for which there is no remedy. It is the\nuniversal weakness of LACK OF AMBITION! Persons, especially salaried people,\nwho schedule their spare time, to provide for home study, seldom remain at the\nbottom very long. Their action opens the way for the upward climb, removes\nmany obstacles from their path, and gains the friendly interest of those who have\nthe power to put them in the way of OPPORTUNITY.\n\nThe home study method of training is especially suited to the needs of\nemployed people who find, after leaving school, that they must acquire\nadditional specialized knowledge, but cannot spare the time to go back to school.\n\nThe changed economic conditions prevailing since the depression have\nmade it necessary for thousands of people to find additional, or new sources of\nincome. For the majority of these, the solution to their problem may be found\nonly by acquiring specialized knowledge. Many will be forced to change their\noccupations entirely. When a merchant finds that a certain line of merchandise is\nnot selling, he usually supplants it with another that is in demand. The person\nwhose business is that of marketing personal services must also be an efficient\nmerchant. If his services do not bring adequate returns in one occupation, he\nmust change to another, where broader opportunities are available.\n\nStuart Austin Wier prepared himself as a Construction Engineer and\nfollowed this line of work until the depression limited his market to where it did\nnot give him the income he required. He took inventory of himself, decided to\nchange his profession to law, went back to school and took special courses by\nwhich he prepared himself as a corporation lawyer. Despite the fact the\ndepression had not ended, he completed his training, passed the Bar\nExamination, and quickly built a lucrative law practice, in Dallas, Texas; in fact\nhe is turning away clients.\n\nJust to keep the record straight, and to anticipate the alibis of those who\nwill say, \"I couldn't go to school because I have a family to support,\" or \"I'm too\nold,\" I will add the information that Mr. Wier was past forty, and married when\nhe went back to school. Moreover, by carefully selecting highly specialized\ncourses, in colleges best prepared to teach the subjects chosen, Mr. Wier\ncompleted in two years the work for which the majority of law students require\nfour years.

The\nway of success is the way of continuous pursuit of knowledge.\n\nLet us consider a specific instance.\nDuring the depression a salesman in a grocery store found himself\nwithout a position. Having had some bookkeeping experience, he took a special\ncourse in accounting, familiarized himself with all the latest bookkeeping and\noffice equipment, and went into business for himself. Starting with the grocer for\nwhom he had formerly worked, he made contracts with more than 100 small\nmerchants to keep their books, at a very nominal monthly fee. His idea was so\npractical that he soon found it necessary to set up a portable office in a light\ndelivery truck, which he equipped with modern bookkeeping machinery. He\nnow has a fleet of these bookkeeping offices \"on wheels\" and employs a large\nstaff of assistants, thus providing small merchants with accounting service equal\nto the best that money can buy, at very nominal cost.\n\nSpecialized knowledge, plus imagination, were the ingredients that went\ninto this unique and successful business. Last year the owner of that business\npaid an income tax of almost ten times as much as was paid by the merchant for\nwhom he worked when the depression forced upon him a temporary adversity\nwhich proved to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nThe beginning of this successful business was an IDEA!\nInasmuch as I had the privilege of supplying the unemployed salesman\nwith that idea, I now assume the further privilege of suggesting another idea\nwhich has within it the possibility of even greater income. Also the possibility of\nrendering useful service to thousands of people who badly need that service.\n\nThe idea was suggested by the salesman who gave up selling and went\ninto the business of keeping books on a wholesale basis. When the plan was\nsuggested as a solution of his unemployment problem, he quickly exclaimed, \"I\nlike the idea, but I would not know how to turn it into cash.\" In other words, he\ncomplained he would not know how to market his bookkeeping knowledge after\nhe acquired it.\n\nSo, that brought up another problem which had to be solved. With the aid\nof a young woman typist, clever at hand lettering, and who could put the story\ntogether, a very attractive book was prepared, describing the advantages of the\nnew system of book-keeping. The pages were neatly typed and pasted in an\nordinary scrapbook, which was used as a silent salesman with which the story of\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n80\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The aggregate annual income from such a service\nmight easily exceed that received by the largest employment agency, and the\nbenefits of the service might be made far greater to the purchaser than any to be\nobtained from an employment agency.\n\nThe IDEA here described was born of necessity, to bridge an emergency\nwhich had to be covered, but it did not stop by merely serving one person. The\nwoman who created the idea has a keen IMAGINATION. She saw in her newly\nborn brain-child the making of a new profession, one that is destined to render\nvaluable service to thousands of people who need practical guidance in\nmarketing personal services.\n\nSpurred to action by the instantaneous success of her first \"PREPARED\nPLAN TO MARKET PERSONAL SERVICES,\" this energetic woman turned next\nto the solution of a similar problem for her son who had just finished college, but\nhad been totally unable to find a market for his services. The plan she originated\nfor his use was the finest specimen of merchandising of personal services I have\never seen.\n\nWhen the plan book had been completed, it contained nearly fifty pages of\nbeautifully typed, properly organized information, telling the story of her son's\nnative ability, schooling, personal experiences, and a great variety of other\ninformation too extensive for description. The plan book also contained a\ncomplete description of the position her son desired, together with a marvelous\nword picture of the exact plan he would use in filling the position.\n\nThe preparation of the plan book required several week's labor, during\nwhich time its creator sent her son to the public library almost daily, to procure\ndata needed in selling his services to best advantage. She sent him, also to all the\ncompetitors of his prospective employer, and gathered from them vital\ninformation concerning their business methods which was of great value in the\nformation of the plan he intended to use in filling the position he sought. When\nthe plan had been finished, it contained more than half a dozen very fine\nsuggestions for the use and benefit of the prospective employer. (The suggestions\nwere put into use by the company).\n\nOne may be inclined to ask, \"Why go to all this trouble to secure a job?\"\nThe answer is straight to the point, also it is dramatic, because it deals with a\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n81\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

THE\nPLAN PREPARED BY THIS WOMAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER SON,\nHELPED HIM GET THE JOB FOR WHICH HE APPLIED, AT THE FIRST\nINTERVIEW, AT A SALARY FIXED BY HIMSELF.\"\n\nMoreover— and this, too, is important— THE POSITION DID NOT\nREQUIRE THE YOUNG MAN TO START AT THE BOTTOM. HE BEGAN AS A\nJUNIOR EXECUTIVE, AT AN EXECUTIVE'S SALARY.\n\n\"Why go to all this trouble?\" do you ask?\nWell, for one thing, the PLANNED PRESENTATION of this young man's\napplication for a position clipped off no less than ten years of time he would\nhave required to get to where he began, had he \"started at the bottom and\nworked his way up.\"\n\nThis idea of starting at the bottom and working one's way up may appear\nto be sound, but the major objection to it is this— too many of those who begin at\nthe bottom never manage to lift their heads high enough to be seen by\nOPPORTUNITY, so they remain at the bottom. It should be remembered, also,\nthat the outlook from the bottom is not so very bright or encouraging. It has a\ntendency to kill off ambition. We call it \"getting into a rut,\" which means that we\naccept our fate because we form the HABIT of daily routine, a habit that finally\nbecomes so strong we cease to try to throw it off. And that is another reason why\nit pays to start one or two steps above the bottom. By so doing one forms the\nHABIT of looking around, of observing how others get ahead, of seeing\nOPPORTUNITY, and of embracing it without hesitation.\n\nDan Halpin is a splendid example of what I mean. During his college\ndays, he was manager of the famous 1930 National Championship Notre Dame\nfootball team, when it was under the direction of the late Knute Rockne.\n\nPerhaps he was inspired by the great football coach to aim high, and NOT\nMISTAKE TEMPORARY DEFEAT FOR FAILURE, just as Andrew Carnegie, the\ngreat industrial leader, inspired his young business lieutenants to set high goals\nfor themselves. At any rate, young Halpin finished college at a mighty\nunfavorable time, when the depression had made jobs scarce, so, after a fling at\ninvestment banking and motion pictures, he took the first opening with a\npotential future he could find— selling electrical hearing aids on a commission\nbasis. ANYONE COULD START IN THAT SORT OF JOB, AND HALPIN KNEW\nIT, but it was enough to open the door of opportunity to him.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n82\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Andrews,\nChairman of the Board of the Dictograph Products Company, a business\ncompetitor of the company for which Halpin worked, wanted to know\nsomething about that man Dan Halpin who was taking big sales away from the\nlong established Dictograph Company. He sent for Halpin. When the interview\nwas over, Halpin was the new Sales Manager, in charge of the Acousticon\nDivision. Then, to test young Halpin's metal, Mr. Andrews went away to Florida\nfor three months, leaving him to sink or swim in his new job. He did not sink!\nKnute Rockne's spirit of \"All the world loves a winner, and has no time for a\nloser inspired him to put so much into his job that he was recently elected VicePresident of the company, and General Manager of the Acousticon and Silent\nRadio Division, a job which most men would be proud to earn through ten years\nof loyal effort. Halpin turned the trick in little more than six months.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether Mr. Andrews or Mr. Halpin is more deserving\nof eulogy, for the reason that both showed evidence of having an abundance of\nthat very rare quality known as IMAGINATION. Mr. Andrews deserves credit\nfor seeing, in young Halpin, a \"go-getter\" of the highest order. Halpin deserves\ncredit for REFUSING TO COMPROMISE WITH LIFE BY ACCEPTING AND\nKEEPING A JOB HE DID NOT WANT, and that is one of the major points I am\ntrying to emphasize through this entire philosophy— that we rise to high\npositions or remain at the bottom BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS WE CAN\nCONTROL IF WE DESIRE TO CONTROL THEM.\n\nI am also trying to emphasize another point, namely, that both success and\nfailure are largely the results of HABIT! I have not the slightest doubt that Dan\nHalpin's close association with the greatest football coach America ever knew,\nplanted in his mind the same brand of DESIRE to excel which made the Notre\nDame football team world famous. Truly, there is something to the idea that\nhero-worship is helpful, provided one worships a WINNER. Halpin tells me that\nRockne was one of the world's greatest leaders of men in all history.\n\nMy belief in the theory that business associations are vital factors, both in\nfailure and in success, was recently demonstrated, when my son Blair was\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n83\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Mr. Halpin offered him a beginning\nsalary of about one half what he could have gotten from a rival company. I\nbrought parental pressure to bear, and induced him to accept the place with Mr.\nHalpin, because I BELIEVE THAT CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH ONE WHO\nREFUSES TO COMPROMISE WITH CIRCUMSTANCES HE DOES NOT LIKE,\nIS AN ASSET THAT CAN NEVER BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF MONEY.\n\nThe bottom is a monotonous, dreary, unprofitable place for any person.\nThat is why I have taken the time to describe how lowly beginnings may be\ncircumvented by proper planning. Also, that is why so much space has been\ndevoted to a description of this new profession, created by a woman who was\ninspired to do a fine job of PLANNING because she wanted her son to have a\nfavorable \"break.\"\n\nWith the changed conditions ushered in by the world economic collapse,\ncame also the need for newer and better ways of marketing PERSONAL\nSERVICES. It is hard to determine why someone had not previously discovered\nthis stupendous need, in view of the fact that more money changes hands in\nreturn for personal services than for any other purpose. The sum paid out\nmonthly, to people who work for wages and salaries, is so huge that it runs into\nhundreds of millions, and the annual distribution amounts to billions.\n\nPerhaps some will find, in the IDEA here briefly described, the nucleus of\nthe riches they DESIRE! Ideas with much less merit have been the seedlings from\nwhich great fortunes have grown. Woolworth's Five and Ten Cent Store idea, for\nexample, had far less merit, but it piled up a fortune for its creator.\n\nThose seeing OPPORTUNITY lurking in this suggestion will find valuable\naid in the chapter on Organized Planning. Incidentally, an efficient merchandiser\nof personal services would find a growing demand for his services wherever\nthere are men and women who seek better markets for their services. By\napplying the Master Mind principle, a few people with suitable talent, could\nform an alliance, and have a paying business very quickly. One would need to be\na fair writer, with a flair for advertising and selling, one handy at typing and\nhand lettering, and one should be a first class business getter who would let the\nworld know about the service. If one person possessed all these abilities, he\nmight carry on the business alone, until it outgrew him.\n\nThe woman who prepared the \"Personal Service Sales Plan\" for her son\nnow receives requests from all parts of the country for her cooperation in\npreparing similar plans for others who desire to market their personal services\nfor more money.

She is so confident of her ability that she accepts, as the major portion of\nher fee, a percentage of the increased pay she helps her clients to earn.\n\nIt must not be supposed that her plan merely consists of clever\nsalesmanship by which she helps men and women to demand and receive more\nmoney for he same services they formerly sold for less pay. She looks after the\ninterests of the purchaser as well as the seller of personal services, and so\nprepares her plans that the employer receives full value for the additional money\nhe pays. The method by which she accomplishes this astonishing result is a\nprofessional secret which she discloses to no one excepting her own clients.\n\nIf you have the IMAGINATION, and seek a more profitable outlet for\nyour personal services, this suggestion may be the stimulus for which you have\nbeen searching. The IDEA is capable of yielding an income far greater than that\nof the \"average\" doctor, lawyer, or engineer whose education required several\nyears in college. The idea is saleable to those seeking new positions, in practically\nall positions calling for managerial or executive ability, and those desiring rearrangement of incomes in their present positions.\n\nThere is no fixed price for sound IDEAS!\nBack of all IDEAS is specialized knowledge. Unfortunately, for those who\ndo not find riches in abundance, specialized knowledge is more abundant and\nmore easily acquired than IDEAS. Because of this very truth, there is a universal\ndemand and an ever-increasing opportunity for the person capable of helping\nmen and women to sell their personal services advantageously. Capability means\nIMAGINATION, the one quality needed to combine specialized knowledge with\nIDEAS, in the form of ORGANIZED PLANS designed to yield riches.\n\nIf you have IMAGINATION this chapter may present you with an idea\nsufficient to serve as the beginning of the riches you desire. Remember, the IDEA\nis the main thing. Specialized knowledge may be found just around the corner—\nany corner!\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n85\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

When FAITH is blended with the\nvibration of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration,\ntranslates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Infinite Intelligence,\nas in the case of prayer.\n\nThe emotions of FAITH, LOVE, and SEX are the most powerful of all the\nmajor positive emotions. When the three are blended, they have the effect of\n\"coloring\" the vibration of thought in such a way that it instantly reaches the\nsubconscious mind, where it is changed into its spiritual equivalent, the only\nform that induces a response from Infinite Intelligence.\n\nLove and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is\npurely biological, and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of\nthese three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication\nbetween the finite, thinking mind of man, and Infinite Intelligence.\n\nHow To Develop Faith\n\nThere comes, now, a statement which will give a better understanding of\nthe importance the principle of auto-suggestion assumes in the transmutation of\ndesire into its physical, or monetary equivalent; namely: FAITH is a state of mind\nwhich may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the\nsubconscious mind, through the principle of auto-suggestion.\n\nAs an illustration, consider the purpose for which you are, presumably,\nreading this book. The object is, naturally, to acquire the ability to transmute the\nintangible thought impulse of DESIRE into its physical counterpart, money. By\nfollowing the instructions laid down in the chapters on auto-suggestion, and the\nsubconscious mind, as summarized in the chapter on auto-suggestion, you may\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n47\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Faith is a state of mind\nwhich you may develop at will, after you have mastered the thirteen principles,\nbecause it is a state of mind which develops voluntarily, through application and\nuse of these principles.\n\n_Repetition of affirmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only known_\n_method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith._\n\nPerhaps the meaning may be made clearer through the following\nexplanation as to the way men sometimes become criminals. Stated in the words\nof a famous criminologist, \"When men first come into contact with crime, they\nabhor it. If they remain in contact with crime for a time, they become accustomed\nto it, and endure it. If they remain in contact with it long enough, they finally\nembrace it, and become influenced by it.\"\n\nThis is the equivalent of saying that any impulse of thought which is\nrepeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted\nupon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its\nphysical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.\n\nIn connection with this, consider again the statement, ALL THOUGHTS\nWHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, (given feeling) AND MIXED WITH\nFAITH, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent\nor counterpart.\n\nThe emotions, or the \"feeling\" portion of thoughts, are the factors which\ngive thoughts vitality, life, and action. The emotions of Faith, Love, and Sex,\nwhen mixed with any thought impulse, give it greater action than any of these\nemotions can do singly.\n\nNot only thought impulses which have been mixed with FAITH, but those\nwhich have been mixed with any of the positive emotions, or any of the negative\nemotions, may reach, and influence the subconscious mind.\n\nFrom this statement, you will understand that the subconscious mind will\ntranslate into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or\ndestructive nature, just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n48\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This accounts for the strange phenomenon which\nso many millions of people experience, referred to as \"misfortune,\" or \"bad luck.\"\n\nThere are millions of people who BELIEVE themselves \"doomed\" to\npoverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they BELIEVE\nthey have no control. They are the creators of their own \"misfortunes,\" because of\nthis negative BELIEF, which is picked up by the subconscious mind, and\ntranslated into its physical equivalent.\n\nThis is an appropriate place at which to suggest again that you may\nbenefit, by passing on to your subconscious mind, any DESIRE which you wish\ntranslated into its physical, or monetary equivalent, in a state of expectancy or\nBELIEF that the transmutation will actually take place. Your BELIEF, or FAITH,\nis the element which determines the action of your subconscious mind. There is\nnothing to hinder you from \"deceiving\" your subconscious mind when giving it\ninstructions through autosuggestion, as I deceived my son's subconscious mind.\n\nTo make this \"deceit\" more realistic, conduct yourself just as you would, if\nyou were ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MATERIAL THING WHICH\nYOU ARE DEMANDING, when you call upon your subconscious mind.\n\nThe subconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the\nmost direct and practical media available, any order which is given to it in a state\nof BELIEF, or FAITH that the order will be carried out.\n\nSurely, enough has been stated to give a starting point from which one\nmay, through experiment and practice, acquire the ability to mix FAITH with\nany order given to the subconscious mind. Perfection will come through practice.\nIt cannot come by merely reading instructions.\n\nIf it be true that one may become a criminal by association with crime,\n(and this is a known fact), it is equally true that one may develop faith by\nvoluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. The mind\ncomes, finally, to take on the nature of the influences which dominate it.\nUnderstand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to\nencourage the positive emotions as dominating forces of your mind, and\ndiscourage — and eliminate negative emotions.\n\nA mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for\nthe state of mind known as faith. A mind so dominated may, at will, give the\nsubconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and act upon immediately.\n\nFAITH IS A STATE OF MIND WHICH MAY BE\n\nINDUCED BY AUTO-SUGGESTION\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n49\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

They have not stated that \"faith is a state of mind,\nand that it may be induced by self-suggestion.\"\n\nIn language which any normal human being can understand, we will\ndescribe all that is known about the principle through which FAITH may be\ndeveloped, where it does not already exist.\n\nHave Faith in yourself; Faith in the Infinite.\nBefore we begin, you should be reminded again that:\nFAITH is the \"eternal elixir\" which gives life, power, and action to the\nimpulse of thought!\n\nThe foregoing sentence is worth reading a second time, and a third, and a\nfourth. It is worth reading aloud!\n\nFAITH is the starting point of all accumulation of riches!\nFAITH is the basis of all \"miracles,\" and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed\nby the rules of science!\n\nFAITH is the only known antidote for FAILURE!\nFAITH is the element, the \"chemical\" which, when mixed with prayer,\ngives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.\n\nFAITH is the element which transforms the ordinary vibration of thought,\ncreated by the finite mind of man, into the spiritual equivalent.\n\nFAITH is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Infinite\nIntelligence can be harnessed and used by man.\n\nEVERY ONE OF THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS IS CAPABLE OF\nPROOF!\n\nThe proof is simple and easily demonstrated. It is wrapped up in the\nprinciple of auto-suggestion. Let us center our attention, therefore, upon the\nsubject of self-suggestion, and find out what it is, and what it is capable of\nachieving.\n\nIt is a well known fact that one comes, finally, to BELIEVE whatever one\nrepeats to one's self, whether the statement be true or false. If a man repeats a lie over\nand over, he will eventually accept the lie as truth. Moreover, he will BELIEVE it\nto be the truth.\n\nEvery man is what he is, because of the DOMINATING THOUGHTS\nwhich he permits to occupy his mind.

A thought thus \"magnetized\" with emotion may be compared to a\nseed which, when planted in fertile soil, germinates, grows, and multiplies itself\nover and over again, until that which was originally one small seed, becomes\ncountless millions of seeds of the SAME BRAND!\n\nThe ether is a great cosmic mass of eternal forces of vibration. It is made\nup of both destructive vibrations and constructive vibrations. It carries, at all\ntimes, vibrations of fear, poverty, disease, failure, misery; and vibrations of\nprosperity, health, success, and happiness, just as surely as it carries the sound of\nhundreds of orchestrations of music, and hundreds of human voices, all of which\nmaintain their own individuality, and means of identification, through the\nmedium of radio.\n\nFrom the great storehouse of the ether, the human mind is constantly\nattracting vibrations which harmonize with that which DOMINATES the human\nmind. Any thought, idea, plan, or purpose which one holds in one's mind attracts,\nfrom the vibrations of the ether, a host of its relatives, adds these \"relatives\" to its\nown force, and grows until it becomes the dominating, MOTIVATING MASTER\nof the individual in whose mind it has been housed.\n\nNow, let us go back to the starting point, and become informed as to how\nthe original seed of an idea, plan, or purpose may be planted in the mind. The\ninformation is easily conveyed: any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the\nmind through repetition of thought. This is why you are asked to write out a\nstatement of your major purpose, or Definite Chief Aim, commit it to memory,\nand repeat it, in audible words, day after day, until these vibrations of sound\nhave reached your subconscious mind.\n\nWe are what we are, because of the vibrations of thought which we pick\nup and register, through the stimuli of our daily environment.\n\nResolve to throw off the influences of any unfortunate environment, and\nto build your own life to ORDER.

I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of\nmy Definite Purpose in life, therefore, I DEMAND of myself\npersistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and\nnow promise to render such action.\n\nSecond. I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will\neventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and\ngradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I\nwill concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the\ntask of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating\nin my mind a clear mental picture of that person.\n\nThird. I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any\ndesire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek\nexpression through some practical means of attaining the object\nback of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding\nof myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE.\n\nFourth.

I fully realize that no wealth or position can long\nendure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage\nin no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects.

It has baffled the scientists of all ages. The psychologists have named\nthis law \"auto-suggestion,\" and let it go at that.\n\nThe name by which one calls this law is of little importance. The\nimportant fact about it is— it WORKS for the glory and success of mankind, IF it\nis used constructively. On the other hand, if used destructively, it will destroy\njust as readily. In this statement may be found a very significant truth, namely;\nthat those who go down in defeat, and end their lives in poverty, misery, and\ndistress, do so because of negative application of the principle of autosuggestion. The cause may be found in the fact that ALL IMPULSES OF\nTHOUGHT HAVE A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE THEMSELVES IN THEIR\nPHYSICAL EQUIVALENT.\n\nThe subconscious mind, (the chemical laboratory in which all thought\nimpulses are combined, and made ready for translation into physical reality),\nmakes no distinction between constructive and destructive thought impulses. It\nworks with the material we feed it, through our thought impulses. The\nsubconscious mind will translate into reality a thought driven by FEAR just as\nreadily as it will translate into reality a thought driven by COURAGE, or FAITH.\n\nThe pages of medical history are rich with illustrations of cases of\n\"suggestive suicide.\" A man may commit suicide through negative suggestion,\njust as effectively as by any other means. In a midwestern city, a man by the\nname of Joseph Grant, a bank official, \"borrowed\" a large sum of the bank's\nmoney, without the consent of the directors. He lost the money through\ngambling. One afternoon, the Bank Examiner came and began to check the\naccounts. Grant left the bank, took a room in a local hotel, and when they found\nhim, three days later, he was lying in bed, wailing and moaning, repeating over\nand over these words, \"My God, this will kill me!

He was a Mr. Nobody from Nowhere, until a great\nexperience came into his life, aroused the sleeping genius within his heart and\nbrain, and gave the world one of its really great men. That \"experience\" was\nmixed with the emotions of sorrow and LOVE. It came to him through Anne\nRutledge, the only woman whom he ever truly loved.\n\nIt is a known fact that the emotion of LOVE is closely akin to the state of\nmind known as FAITH, and this for the reason that Love comes very near to\ntranslating one's thought impulses into their spiritual equivalent. During his\nwork of research, the author discovered, from the analysis of the life-work and\nachievements of hundreds of men of outstanding accomplishment, that there\nwas the influence of a woman's love back of nearly EVERY ONE OF THEM. The\nemotion of love, in the human heart and brain, creates a favorable field of\nmagnetic attraction, which causes an influx of the higher and finer vibrations\nwhich are afloat in the ether.\n\nIf you wish evidence of the power of FAITH, study the achievements of\nmen and women who have employed it. At the head of the list comes the\nNazarene. Christianity is the greatest single force which influences the minds of\nmen. The basis of Christianity is FAITH, no matter how many people may have\nperverted, or misinterpreted the meaning of this great force, and no matter how\nmany dogmas and creeds have been created in its name, which do not reflect its\ntenets.\n\nThe sum and substance of the teachings and the achievements of Christ,\nwhich may have been interpreted as \"miracles,\" were nothing more nor less than\nFAITH. If there are any such phenomena as \"miracles\" they are produced only\nthrough the state of mind known as FAITH! Some teachers of religion, and many\nwho call themselves Christians, neither understand nor practice FAITH.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n55\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

In this\nman the world has one of the most astounding examples known to civilization,\nof the possibilities of FAITH. Gandhi wields more potential power than any man\nliving at this time, and this, despite the fact that he has none of the orthodox tools\nof power, such as money, battle ships, soldiers, and materials of warfare. Gandhi\nhas no money, he has no home, he does not own a suit of clothes, but HE DOES\nHAVE POWER. How does he come by that power?\n\nHE CREATED IT OUT OF HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLE\nOF FAITH, AND THROUGH HIS ABILITY TO TRANSPLANT THAT FAITH\nINTO THE MINDS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE.\n\nGandhi has accomplished, through the influence of FAITH, that which the\nstrongest military power on earth could not, and never will accomplish through\nsoldiers and military equipment. He has accomplished the astounding feat of\nINFLUENCING two hundred million minds to COALESCE AND MOVE IN\nUNISON, AS A SINGLE MIND.\n\nWhat other force on earth, except FAITH could do as much?\nThere will come a day when employees as well as employers will discover\nthe possibilities of FAITH. That day is dawning. The whole world has had ample\nopportunity, during the recent business depression, to witness what the LACK\nOF FAITH will do to business.\n\nSurely, civilization has produced a sufficient number of intelligent human\nbeings to make use of this great lesson which the depression has taught the\nworld. During this depression, the world had evidence in abundance that\nwidespread FEAR will paralyze the wheels of industry and business. Out of this\nexperience will arise leaders in business and industry who will profit by the\nexample which Gandhi has set for the world, and they will apply to business the\nsame tactics which he has used in building the greatest following known in the\nhistory of the world. These leaders will come from the rank and file of the\nunknown men, who now labor in the steel plants, the coal mines, the automobile\nfactories, and in the small towns and cities of America.\n\nBusiness is due for a reform, make no mistake about this! The methods of\nthe past, based upon economic combinations of FORCE and FEAR, will be\nsupplanted by the better principles of FAITH and cooperation. Men who labor\nwill receive more than daily wages; they will receive dividends from the\nbusiness, the same as those who supply the capital for business; but, first they\nmust GIVE MORE TO THEIR EMPLOYERS, and stop this bickering and\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n56\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

They must earn the right to\n_dividends!_\n\nMoreover, and this is the most important thing of all— THEY WILL BE\nLED BY LEADERS WHO WILL UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE PRINCIPLES\nEMPLOYED BY MAHATMA GANDHI. Only in this way may leaders get from\ntheir followers the spirit of FULL cooperation which constitutes power in its\nhighest and most enduring form.\n\nThis stupendous machine age in which we live, and from which we are\njust emerging, has taken the soul out of men. Its leaders have driven men as\nthough they were pieces of cold machinery; they were forced to do so by the\nemployees who have bargained, at the expense of all concerned, to get and not to\ngive. The watchword of the future will be HUMAN HAPPINESS AND\nCONTENTMENT, and when this state of mind shall have been attained, the\nproduction will take care of itself, more effectively than anything that has ever\nbeen accomplished where men did not, and could not mix FAITH and individual\ninterest with their labor.\n\nBecause of the need for faith and cooperation in operating business and\nindustry, it will be both interesting and profitable to analyze an event which\nprovides an excellent understanding of the method by which industrialists and\nbusiness men accumulate great fortunes, by giving before they try to get.\n\nThe event chosen for this illustration dates back to 1900, when the United\nStates Steel Corporation was being formed. As you read the story, keep in mind\nthese fundamental facts and you will understand how IDEAS have been\nconverted into huge fortunes.\n\nFirst, the huge United States Steel Corporation was born in the mind of\nCharles M. Schwab, in the form of an IDEA he created through his\nIMAGINATION! Second, he mixed FAITH with his IDEA. Third, he formulated\na PLAN for the transformation of his IDEA into physical and financial reality.\nFourth, he put his plan into action with his famous speech at the University Club.\nFifth, he applied, and followed-through on his PLAN with PERSISTENCE, and\nbacked it with firm DECISION until it had been fully carried out. Sixth, he\nprepared the way for success by a BURNING DESIRE for success.\n\nIf you are one of those who have often wondered how great fortunes are\naccumulated, this story of the creation of the United States Steel Corporation will\nbe enlightening. If you have any doubt that men can THINK AND GROW RICH,\nthis story should dispel that doubt, because you can plainly see in the story of the\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n57\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Edward Simmons and Charles Stewart Smith, their hearts full of\ngratitude for the lavish hospitality bestowed on them by Charles M. Schwab\nduring a recent visit to Pittsburgh, had arranged the dinner to introduce the\nthirty-eight-year-old steel man to eastern banking society. But they didn't expect\nhim to stampede the convention. They warned him, in fact, that the bosoms\nwithin New York's stuffed shirts would not be responsive to oratory, and that, if\nhe didn't want to bore the Stilhnans and Harrimans and Vanderbilts, he had\nbetter limit himself to fifteen or twenty minutes of polite vaporings and let it go\nat that.\n\n\"Even John Pierpont Morgan, sitting on the right hand of Schwab as\nbecame his imperial dignity, intended to grace the banquet table with his\npresence only briefly. And so far as the press and public were concerned, the\nwhole affair was of so little moment that no mention of it found its way into print\nthe next day.\n\n\"So the two hosts and their distinguished guests ate their way through the\nusual seven or eight courses. There was little conversation and what there was of\nit was restrained. Few of the bankers and brokers had met Schwab, whose career\nhad flowered along the banks of the Monongahela, and none knew him well. But\nbefore the evening was over, they— and with them Money Master Morgan —\nwere to be swept off their feet, and a billion dollar baby, the United States Steel\nCorporation, was to be conceived.\n\n\"It is perhaps unfortunate, for the sake of history, that no record of Charlie\nSchwab's speech at the dinner ever was made. He repeated some parts of it at a\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n58\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

And still later, when the\nGovernment brought suit to dissolve the Steel Trust, he gave his own version,\nfrom the witness stand, of the remarks that stimulated Morgan into a frenzy of\nfinancial activity.\n\n\"It is probable, however, that it was a 'homely' speech, somewhat\nungrammatical (for the niceties of language never bothered Schwab), full of\nepigram and threaded with wit. But aside from that it had a galvanic force and\neffect upon the five billions of estimated capital that was represented by the\ndiners. After it was over and the gathering was still under its spell, although\nSchwab had talked for ninety minutes, Morgan led the orator to a recessed\nwindow where, dangling their legs from the high, uncomfortable seat, they\ntalked for an hour more.\n\n\"The magic of the Schwab personality had been turned on, full force, but\nwhat was more important and lasting was the full-fledged, clear-cut program he\nlaid down for the aggrandizement of Steel. Many other men had tried to interest\nMorgan in slapping together a steel trust after the pattern of the biscuit, wire and\nhoop, sugar, rubber, whisky, oil or chewing gum combinations. John W. Gates,\nthe gambler, had urged it, but Morgan distrusted him. The Moore boys, Bill and\nJim, Chicago stock jobbers who had glued together a match trust and a cracker\ncorporation, had urged it and failed. Elbert H. Gary, the sanctimonious country\nlawyer, wanted to foster it, but he wasn't big enough to be impressive. Until\nSchwab's eloquence took J. P. Morgan to the heights from which he could\nvisualize the solid results of the most daring financial undertaking ever\nconceived, the project was regarded as a delirious dream of easy-money\ncrackpots.\n\n\"The financial magnetism that began, a generation ago, to attract\nthousands of small and sometimes inefficiently managed companies into large\nand competition-crushing combinations, had become operative in the steel world\nthrough the devices of that jovial business pirate, John W. Gates. Gates already\nhad formed the American Steel and Wire Company out of a chain of small\nconcerns, and together with Morgan had created the Federal Steel Company. The\nNational Tube and American Bridge companies were two more Morgan\nconcerns, and the Moore Brothers had forsaken the match and cookie business to\nform the 'American' group— Tin Plate, Steel Hoop, Sheet Steel— and the\nNational Steel Company.\n\n\"But by the side of Andrew Carnegie's gigantic vertical trust, a trust\nowned and operated by fifty-three partners, those other combinations were\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n59\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

They might combine to their heart's content but the whole lot of them\ncouldn't make a dent in the Carnegie organization, and Morgan knew it.\n\n\"The eccentric old Scot knew it, too. From the magnificent heights of Skibo\nCastle he had viewed, first with amusement and then with resentment, the\nattempts of Morgan's smaller companies to cut into his business. When the\nattempts became too bold, Carnegie's temper was translated into anger and\nretaliation. He decided to duplicate every mill owned by his rivals. Hitherto, he\nhadn't been interested in wire, pipe, hoops, or sheet. Instead, he was content to\nsell such companies the raw steel and let them work it into whatever shape they\nwanted. Now, with Schwab as his chief and able lieutenant, he planned to drive\nhis enemies to the wall.\n\n\"So it was that in the speech of Charles M. Schwab, Morgan saw the\nanswer to his problem of combination. A trust without Carnegie—giant of them\nall—would be no trust at all, a plum pudding, as one writer said, without the\nplums.\n\n\"Schwab's speech on the night of December 12, 1900, undoubtedly carried\nthe inference, though not the pledge, that the vast Carnegie enterprise could be\nbrought under the Morgan tent. He talked of the world future for steel, of\nreorganization for efficiency, of specialization, of the scrapping of unsuccessful\nmills and concentration of effort on the flourishing properties, of economies in\nthe ore traffic, of economies in overhead and administrative departments, of\ncapturing foreign markets.\n\n\"More than that, he told the buccaneers among them wherein lay the\nerrors of their customary piracy. Their purposes, he inferred, bad been to create\nmonopolies, raise prices, and pay themselves fat dividends out of privilege.\nSchwab condemned the system in his heartiest manner. The shortsightedness of\nsuch a policy, he told his hearers, lay in the fact that it restricted the market in an\nera when everything cried for expansion. By cheapening the cost of steel, he\nargued, an ever-expanding market would be created; more uses for steel would\nbe devised, and a goodly portion of the world trade could be captured. Actually,\nthough he did not know it, Schwab was an apostle of modern mass production.\n\n\"So the dinner at the University Club came to an end. Morgan went home,\nto think about Schwab's rosy predictions. Schwab went back to Pittsburgh to run\nthe steel business for 'Wee Andra Carnegie,' while Gary and the rest went back to\ntheir stock tickers, to fiddle around in anticipation of the next move.\n\n\"It was not long coming. It took Morgan about one week to digest the feast\nof reason Schwab had placed before him. When he had assured himself that no\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n60\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Mr. Carnegie, Schwab indicated, might not like it if he found his\ntrusted company president had been flirting with the Emperor of Wall Street, the\nStreet upon which Carnegie was resolved never to tread. Then it was suggested\nby John W. Gates the go-between, that if Schwab 'happened' to be in the Bellevue\nHotel in Philadelphia, J. P. Morgan might also 'happen' to be there. When\nSchwab arrived, however, Morgan was inconveniently ill at his New York home,\nand so, on the elder man's pressing invitation, Schwab went to New York and\npresented himself at the door of the financier's library.\n\n\"Now certain economic historians have professed the belief that from the\nbeginning to the end of the drama, the stage was set by Andrew Carnegie— that\nthe dinner to Schwab, the famous speech, the Sunday night conference between\nSchwab and the Money King, were events arranged by the canny Scot. The truth\nis exactly the opposite. When Schwab was called in to consummate the deal, he\ndidn't even know whether 'the little boss, ' as Andrew was called, would so\nmuch as listen to an offer to sell, particularly to a group of men whom Andrew\nregarded as being endowed with something less than holiness. But Schwab did\ntake into the conference with him, in his own handwriting, six sheets of copperplate figures, representing to his mind the physical worth and the potential\nearning capacity of every steel company he regarded as an essential star in the\nnew metal firmament.\n\n\"Four men pondered over these figures all night. The chief, of course, was\nMorgan, steadfast in his belief in the Divine Right of Money. With him was his\naristocratic partner, Robert Bacon, a scholar and a gentleman. The third was John\nW. Gates whom Morgan scorned as a gambler and used as a tool. The fourth was\nSchwab, who knew more about the processes of making and selling steel than\nany whole group of men then living. Throughout that conference, the\nPittsburgher's figures were never questioned. If he said a company was worth so\nmuch, then it was worth that much and no more. He was insistent, too, upon\nincluding in the combination only those concerns he nominated. He had\nconceived a corporation in which there would be no duplication, not even to\nsatisfy the greed of friends who wanted to unload their companies upon the\nbroad Morgan shoulders. Thus he left out, by design, a number of the larger\nconcerns upon which the Walruses and Carpenters of Wall Street had cast\nhungry eyes.\n\n\"When dawn came, Morgan rose and straightened his back. Only one\nquestion remained.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n61\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

' he asked.\n\"' I can try, ' said Schwab.\n\"' If you can get him to sell, I will undertake the matter, ' said Morgan.\n\"So far so good. But would Carnegie sell? How much would he demand?\n(Schwab thought about $320,000,000). What would he take payment in? Common\nor preferred stocks? Bonds? Cash? Nobody could raise a third of a billion dollars\nin cash.\n\n\"There was a golf game in January on the frost-cracking heath of the St.\nAndrews links in Westchester, with Andrew bundled up in sweaters against the\ncold, and Charlie talking volubly, as usual, to keep his spirits up. But no word of\nbusiness was mentioned until the pair sat down in the cozy warmth of the\nCarnegie cottage hard by. Then, with the same persuasiveness that had\nhypnotized eighty millionaires at the University Club, Schwab poured out the\nglittering promises of retirement in comfort, of untold millions to satisfy the old\nman's social caprices. Carnegie capitulated, wrote a figure on a slip of paper,\nhanded it to Schwab and said, 'all right, that's what we'll sell for.'\n\n\"The figure was approximately $400,000,000, and was reached by taking\nthe $320,000,000 mentioned by Schwab as a basic figure, and adding to it\n$80,000,000 to represent the increased capital value over the previous two years.\n\n\"Later, on the deck of a trans-Atlantic liner, the Scotsman said ruefully to\nMorgan, 'I wish I had asked you for $100,000,000 more.'\n\n\"' If you had asked for it, you'd have gotten it, ' Morgan told him\ncheerfully.\n\n                     - * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"There was an uproar, of course. A British correspondent cabled that the\nforeign steel world was 'appalled' by the gigantic combination. President Hadley,\nof Yale, declared that unless trusts were regulated the country might expect 'an\nemperor in Washington within the next twenty-five years. ' But that able stock\nmanipulator, Keene, went at his work of shoving the new stock at the public so\nvigorously that all the excess water— estimated by some at nearly $600,000,000—\nwas absorbed in a twinkling. So Carnegie had his millions, and the Morgan\nsyndicate had $62,000,000 for all its 'trouble, ' and all the 'boys, ' from Gates to\nGary, had their millions.\n\n                     - * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n62\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

He was made president\nof the new corporation and remained in control until 1930.\"\n\nThe dramatic story of \"Big Business\" which you have just finished, was\nincluded in this book, because it is a perfect illustration of the method by which\n_DESIRE CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT!_\n\nI imagine some readers will question the statement that a mere, intangible\nDESIRE can be converted into its physical equivalent. Doubtless some will say,\n\"You cannot convert NOTHING into SOMETHING!\" The answer is in the story\nof United States Steel.\n\nThat giant organization was created in the mind of one man. The plan by\nwhich the organization was provided with the steel mills that gave it financial\nstability was created in the mind of the same man. His FAITH, his DESIRE, his\nIMAGINATION, his PERSISTENCE were the real ingredients that went into\nUnited States Steel. The steel mills and mechanical equipment acquired by the\ncorporation, AFTER IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO LEGAL EXISTENCE, were\nincidental, but careful analysis will disclose the fact that the appraised value of\nthe properties acquired by the corporation increased in value by an estimated\nSIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS, by the mere transaction which\nconsolidated them under one management.\n\nIn other words, Charles M. Schwab's IDEA, plus the FAITH with which he\nconveyed it to the minds of J. P. Morgan and the others, was marketed for a\nprofit of approximately $600,000,000. Not an insignificant sum for a single IDEA!\n\nWhat happened to some of the men who took their share of the millions of\ndollars of profit made by this transaction, is a matter with which we are not now\nconcerned. The important feature of the astounding achievement is that it serves\nas unquestionable evidence of the soundness of the philosophy described in this\nbook, because this philosophy was the warp and the woof of the entire\ntransaction. Moreover, the practicability of the philosophy has been established\nby the fact that the United States Steel Corporation prospered, and became one of\nthe richest and most powerful corporations in America, employing thousands of\npeople, developing new uses for steel, and opening new markets; thus proving\nthat the $600,000,000 in profit which the Schwab IDEA produced was earned.\n\nRICHES begin in the form of THOUGHT!\nThe amount is limited only by the person in whose mind the THOUGHT\nis put into motion.

The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it\ninto my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry\ntwinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to\nunderstand the full significance of what he had said to me.\n\nWhen he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to\nspend twenty years or more, preparing myself to take it to the world, to men and\nwomen who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would,\nand with Mr. Carnegie's cooperation, I have kept my promise.\n\nThis book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test by\nthousands of people, in almost every walk of life. It was Mr. Carnegie's idea that\nthe magic formula, which gave him a stupendous fortune, ought to be placed\nwithin reach of people who do not have time to investigate how men make\nmoney, and it was his hope that I might test and demonstrate the soundness of\nthe formula through the experience of men and women in every calling. He\nbelieved the formula should be taught in all public schools and colleges, and\nexpressed the opinion that if it were properly taught it would so revolutionize\nthe entire educational system that the time spent in school could be reduced to\nless than half.\n\nHis experience with Charles M. Schwab, and other young men of Mr.\nSchwab's type, convinced Mr. Carnegie that much of that which is taught in the\nschools is of no value whatsoever in connection with the business of earning a\nliving or accumulating riches. He had arrived at this decision, because he had\ntaken into his business one young man after another, many of them with but\nlittle schooling, and by coaching them in the use of this formula, developed in\nthem rare leadership. Moreover, his coaching made fortunes for everyone of them who\n_followed his instructions._\n\nIn the chapter on Faith, you will read the astounding story of the\norganization of the giant United States Steel Corporation, as it was conceived and\ncarried out by one of the young men through whom Mr. Carnegie proved that\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n10\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This single application of the\nsecret, by that young man— Charles M. Schwab— made him a huge fortune in\nboth money and OPPORTUNITY. Roughly speaking, this particular application\nof the formula was worth six hundred million dollars.\n\nThese facts—and they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew\nMr. Carnegie— give you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may bring to\nyou, provided you KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.\n\nEven before it had undergone twenty years of practical testing, the secret\nwas passed on to more than one hundred thousand men and women who have\nused it for their personal benefit, as Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Some\nhave made fortunes with it. Others have used it successfully in creating harmony\nin their homes. A clergyman used it so effectively that it brought him an income\nof upwards of $75,000.00 a year.\n\nArthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a\n\"guinea pig\" on which to test the formula. The business came to life and made a\nfortune for its owners. It is still thriving, although Mr. Nash has gone. The\nexperiment was so unique that newspapers and magazines, gave it more than a\nmillion dollars' worth of laudatory publicity.\n\nThe secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was\nready for it— so ready that he gave up his profession and studied law. Did he\nsucceed? That story is told too.\n\nI gave the secret to Jennings Randolph, the day he graduated from\nCollege, and he has used it so successfully that he is now serving his third term\nas a Member of Congress, with an excellent opportunity to keep on using it until\nit carries him to the White House.\n\nWhile serving as Advertising Manager of the La-Salle Extension\nUniversity, when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of seeing J. G.\nChapline, President of the University, use the formula so effectively that he has\nsince made the LaSalle one of the great extension schools of the country.\n\nThe secret to which I refer has been mentioned no fewer than a hundred\ntimes, throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it seems to work\nmore successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, where THOSE\nWHO ARE READY, and SEARCHING FOR IT, may pick it up.

He used the information so effectively\nthat he went directly into a responsible position at a beginning salary greater\nthan the average man ever earns. His story has been briefly described in chapter\ntwo. When you read it, perhaps you will dismiss any feeling you may have had,\nat the beginning of the book, that it promised too much. And, too, if you have\never been discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the\nvery soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever handicapped\nby illness or physical affliction, this story of my son's discovery and use of the\nCarnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in the Desert of Lost Hope, for which\nyou have been searching.\n\nThis secret was extensively used by President Woodrow Wilson, during\nthe World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in the war,\ncarefully wrapped in the training received before going to the front. President\nWilson told me it was a strong factor in raising the funds needed for the war.\n\nMore than twenty years ago, Hon. Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident\nCommissioner of the Philippine Islands), was inspired by the secret to gain\nfreedom for his people. He has gained freedom for the Philippines, and is the\nfirst President of the free state.\n\nA peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acquire it and use\nit, find themselves literally swept on to success, with but little effort, and they\nnever again submit to failure! If you doubt this, study the names of those who\nhave used it, wherever they have been mentioned, check their records for\nyourself, and be convinced.\n\nThere is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!\nThe secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the\nprice is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not\nintentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, it cannot be purchased for\nmoney, for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in\npossession of those who are ready for it.\n\nThe secret serves equally well, all who are ready for it. Education has\nnothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its way into\nthe possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so intelligently that he\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n12\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

He used it\nso effectively that, although he was then making only $12,000 a year, he\naccumulated a great fortune, and retired from active business while still a young\nman. You will find his story at the beginning of the first chapter. It should\nconvince you that riches are not beyond your reach, that you can still be what\nyou wish to be, that money, fame, recognition and happiness can be had by all\nwho are ready and determined to have these blessings. How do I know these\nthings? You should have the answer before you finish this book. You may find it\nin the very first chapter, or on the last page.\n\nWhile I was performing the twenty year task of research, which I had\nundertaken at Mr. Carnegie's request, I analyzed hundreds of well known men,\nmany of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes through\nthe aid of the Carnegie secret; among these men were: —\n\n\nHENRY FORD\nWILLIAM WRIGLEY JR.\n\n\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\n\n|HENRY FORD WILLIAM WRIGLEY JR.

I have\nnever known anyone who was inspired to use the secret, who did not achieve\nnoteworthy success in his chosen calling. I have never known any person to\ndistinguish himself, or to accumulate riches of any consequence, without\npossession of the secret. From these two facts I draw the conclusion that the\nsecret is more important, as a part of the knowledge essential for selfdetermination, than any which one receives through what is popularly known as\n\"education.\"\n\nWhat is EDUCATION, anyway? This has been answered in full detail.\nAs far as schooling is concerned, many of these men had very little. John\nWanamaker once told me that what little schooling he had, he acquired in very\nmuch the same manner as a modern loco-motive takes on water, by \"scooping it\nup as it runs.\" Henry Ford never reached high school, let alone college. I am not\nattempting to minimize the value of schooling, but I am trying to express my\nearnest belief that those who master and apply the secret will reach high stations,\naccumulate riches, and bargain with life on their own terms, even if their\nschooling has been meager.\n\nSomewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the\npage and stand boldly before you, IF YOU ARE READY FOR IT! When it\nappears, you will recognize it. Whether you receive the sign in the first or the last\nchapter, stop for a moment when it presents itself, and turn down a glass, for that\noccasion will mark the most important turning-point of your life.\n\nWe pass now, to Chapter One, and to the story of my very dear friend,\nwho has generously acknowledged having seen the mystic sign, and whose\nbusiness achievements are evidence enough that he turned down a glass. As you\nread his story, and the others, remember that they deal with the important\nproblems of life, such as all men experience.\n\nThe problems arising from one's endeavor to earn a living, to find hope,\ncourage, contentment and peace of mind; to accumulate riches and to enjoy\nfreedom of body and spirit.\n\nRemember, too, as you go through the book, that it deals with facts and\nnot with fiction, its purpose being to convey a great universal truth through\nwhich all who are READY may learn, not only WHAT TO DO, BUT ALSO HOW\nTO DO IT! and receive, as well, THE NEEDED STIMULUS TO MAKE A START.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n14\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This is no mere statement of a\ntheory— it is a fact.\n\nPROCRASTINATION, the opposite of DECISION, is a common enemy\nwhich practically every man must conquer.\n\nYou will have an opportunity to test your capacity to reach quick and\n_definite DECISIONS when you finish reading this book, and are ready to begin_\nputting into ACTION the principles which it describes.\n\nAnalysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well\nbeyond the million dollar mark, disclosed the fact that every one of them had the\nhabit of REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY, and of changing these decisions\nSLOWLY, if, and when they were changed. People who fail to accumulate\nmoney, without exception, have the habit of reaching decisions, IF AT ALL, very\n_slowly, and of changing these decisions quickly and often._\n\nOne of Henry Ford's most outstanding qualities is his habit of reaching\ndecisions quickly and definitely, and changing them slowly. This quality is so\npronounced in Mr. Ford, that it has given him the reputation of being obstinate.\nIt was this quality which prompted Mr. Ford to continue to manufacture his\nfamous Model \"T\" (the world's ugliest car), when all of his advisors, and many of\nthe purchasers of the car, were urging him to change it.\n\nPerhaps, Mr. Ford delayed too long in making the change, but the other\nside of the story is, that Mr. Ford's firmness of decision yielded a huge fortune,\nbefore the change in model became necessary. There is but little doubt that Mr.\nFord's habit of definiteness of decision assumes the proportion of obstinacy, but\nthis quality is preferable to slowness in reaching decisions and quickness in\nchanging them.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n140\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

They permit\nthe newspapers and the \"gossiping\" neighbors to do their \"thinking\" for them.\n\"Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of\nopinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are\ninfluenced by \"opinions\" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in\nany undertaking, much less in that of transmuting YOUR OWN DESIRE into\nmoney.\n\nIf you are influenced by the opinions of others, you will have no DESIRE\nof your own.\n\nKeep your own counsel, when you begin to put into practice the\nprinciples described here, by reaching your own decisions and following them.\nTake no one into your confidence, EXCEPT the members of your \"Master Mind\"\ngroup, and be very sure in your selection of this group, that you choose ONLY\nthose who will be in COMPLETE SYMPATHY AND HARMONY WITH YOUR\nPURPOSE.\n\nClose friends and relatives, while not meaning to do so, often handicap\none through \"opinions\" and sometimes through ridicule, which is meant to be\nhumorous. Thousands of men and women carry inferiority complexes with them\nall through life, because some well-meaning, but ignorant person destroyed their\nconfidence through \"opinions\" or ridicule.\n\nYou have a brain and mind of your own. USE IT, and reach your own\ndecisions. If you need facts or information from other people, to enable you to\nreach decisions, as you probably will in many instances; acquire these facts or\nsecure the information you need quietly, without disclosing your purpose.\n\nIt is characteristic of people who have but a smattering or a veneer of\nknowledge to try to give the impression that they have much knowledge. Such\npeople generally do TOO MUCH talking, and TOO LITTLE listening. Keep your\neyes and ears wide open— and your mouth CLOSED, if you wish to acquire the\nhabit of prompt DECISION. Those who talk too much do little else. If you talk\nmore than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of many opportunities to\naccumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose your PLANS and\nPURPOSES to people who will take great delight in defeating you, because they\nenvy you.\n\nRemember, also, that every time you open your mouth in the presence of a\nperson who has an abundance of knowledge, you display to that person, your\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n141\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Genuine wisdom is usually\nconspicuous through modesty and silence.\n\nKeep in mind the fact that every person with whom you associate is, like\nyourself, seeking the opportunity to accumulate money. If you talk about your\nplans too freely, you may be surprised when you learn that some other person\nhas beaten you to your goal by PUTTING INTO ACTION AHEAD OF YOU, the\nplans of which you talked unwisely.\n\nLet one of your first decisions be to KEEP A CLOSED MOUTH AND\nOPEN EARS AND EYES.\n\nAs a reminder to yourself to follow this advice, it will be helpful if you\ncopy the following epigram in large letters and place it where you will see it\ndaily.\n\n\"TELL THE WORLD WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO, BUT FIRST SHOW\nIT.\"\n\nThis is the equivalent of saying that \"deeds, and not words, are what count\nmost.\"\n\nFREEDOM OR DEATH ON A DECISION\n\nThe value of decisions depends upon the courage required to render them.\nThe great decisions, which served as the foundation of civilization, were reached\nby assuming great risks, which often meant the possibility of death.\n\nLincoln's decision to issue his famous Proclamation of Emancipation,\nwhich gave freedom to the colored people of America, was rendered with full\nunderstanding that his act would turn thousands of friends and political\nsupporters against him. He knew, too, that the carrying out of that proclamation\nwould mean death to thousands of men on the battlefield. In the end, it cost\nLincoln his life. That required courage.\n\nSocrates' decision to drink the cup of poison, rather than compromise in\nhis personal belief, was a decision of courage. It turned Time ahead a thousand\nyears, and gave to people then unborn, the right to freedom of thought and of\nspeech.\n\nThe decision of Gen. Robert E. Lee, when he came to the parting of the\nway with the Union, and took up the cause of the South, was a decision of\ncourage, for he well knew that it might cost him his own life, that it would surely\ncost the lives of others.\n\nBut, the greatest decision of all time, as far as any American citizen is\nconcerned, was reached in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776, when fifty-six men signed\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n142\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

We remember our history, as it was\ntaught; we remember dates, and the names of the men who fought; we remember\nValley Forge, and Yorktown; we remember George Washington, and Lord\nCornwallis. But we know little of the real forces back of these names, dates, and\nplaces. We know still less of that intangible POWER, which insured us freedom\n_long before Washington's armies reached Yorktown._\n\nWe read the history of the Revolution, and falsely imagine that George\nWashington was the Father of our Country, that it was he who won our freedom,\nwhile the truth is—Washington was only an accessory after the fact, because\nvictory for his armies had been insured long before Lord Cornwallis\nsurrendered. This is not intended to rob Washington of any of the glory he so\nrichly merited. Its purpose, rather, is to give greater attention to the astounding\nPOWER that was the real cause of his victory.\n\nIt is nothing short of tragedy that the writers of history have missed,\nentirely, even the slightest reference to the irresistible POWER, which gave birth\nand freedom to the nation destined to set up new standards of independence for\nall the peoples of the earth. I say it is a tragedy, because it is the self-same\nPOWER which must be used by every individual who surmounts the difficulties\nof Life, and forces Life to pay the price asked.\n\nLet us briefly review the events which gave birth to this POWER. The\nstory begins with an incident in Boston, March 5, 1770. British soldiers were\npatroling the streets, by their presence, openly threatening the citizens. The\ncolonists resented armed men marching in their midst. They began to express\ntheir resentment openly, hurling stones as well as epithets, at the marching\nsoldiers, until the commanding officer gave orders, \"Fix bayonets. . . . Charge!\"\n\nThe battle was on. It resulted in the death and injury of many. The\nincident aroused such resentment that the Provincial Assembly, (made up of\nprominent colonists), called a meeting for the purpose of taking definite action.\nTwo of the members of that Assembly were, John Hancock, and Samuel Adams\n—LONG LIVE THEIR NAMES! They spoke up courageously, and declared that a\nmove must be made to eject all British soldiers from Boston.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n143\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

It had caused a situation destined to change the entire\ntrend of civilization. Strange, is it not, how the great changes, such as the\nAmerican Revolution, and the World War, often have their beginnings in\ncircumstances which seem unimportant? It is interesting, also, to observe that\nthese important changes usually begin in the form of a DEFINITE DECISION in\nthe minds of a relatively small number of people. Few of us know the history of\nour country well enough to realize that John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and\nRichard Henry Lee (of the Province of Virginia) were the real Fathers of our\nCountry.\n\nRichard Henry Lee became an important factor in this story by reason of\nthe fact that he and Samuel Adams communicated frequently (by\ncorrespondence), sharing freely their fears and their hopes concerning the\nwelfare of the people of their Provinces. From this practice, Adams conceived the\nidea that a mutual exchange of letters between the thirteen Colonies might help\nto bring about the coordination of effort so badly needed in connection with the\nsolution of their problems. Two years after the clash with the soldiers in Boston\n(March '72), Adams presented this idea to the Assembly, in the form of a motion\nthat a Correspondence Committee be established among the Colonies, with\ndefinitely appointed correspondents in each Colony, \"for the purpose of friendly\ncooperation for the betterment of the Colonies of British America.\"\n\nMark well this incident! It was the beginning of the organization of the\nfar-flung POWER destined to give freedom to you, and to me. The Master Mind\nhad already been organized. It consisted of Adams, Lee, and Hancock. \"I tell you\nfurther, that if two of you agree upon the earth concerning anything for which\nyou ask, it will come to you from My Father, who is in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Committee of Correspondence was organized. Observe that this move\nprovided the way for increasing the power of the Master Mind by adding to it\nmen from all the Colonies. Take notice that this procedure constituted the first\nORGANIZED PLANNING of the disgruntled Colonists.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n144\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The citizens of the Colonies had been waging\ndisorganized warfare against the British soldiers, through incidents similar to the\nBoston riot, but nothing of benefit had been accomplished. Their individual\ngrievances had not been consolidated under one Master Mind. No group of\nindividuals had put their hearts, minds, souls, and bodies together in one\ndefinite DECISION to settle their difficulty with the British once and for all, until\nAdams, Hancock, and Lee got together.\n\nMeanwhile, the British were not idle. They, too, were doing some\nPLANNING and \"Master-Minding\" on their own account, with the advantage of\nhaving back of them money, and organized soldiery.\n\nThe Crown appointed Gage to supplant Hutchinson as the Governor of\nMassachusetts. One of the new Governor's first acts was to send a messenger to\ncall on Samuel Adams, for the purpose of endeavoring to stop his opposition—\nby FEAR.\n\nWe can best understand the spirit of what happened by quoting the\nconversation between Col. Fenton, (the messenger sent by Gage), and Adams.\n\nCol. Fenton: \"I have been authorized by Governor Gage, to assure you,\nMr. Adams, that the Governor has been empowered to confer upon you such\nbenefits as would be satisfactory, [endeavor to win Adams by promise of bribes],\nupon the condition that you engage to cease in your opposition to the measures\nof the government. It is the Governor's advice to you, Sir, not to incur the further\ndispleasure of his majesty. Your conduct has been such as makes you liable to\npenalties of an Mt of Henry VIII, by which persons can be sent to England for\ntrial for treason, or misprision of treason, at the discretion of a governor of a\nprovince. But, BY CHANGING YOUR POLITICAL COURSE, you will not only\nreceive great personal advantages, but you will make your peace with the King.\"\n\nSamuel Adams had the choice of two DECISIONS. He could cease his\nopposition, and receive personal bribes, or he could CONTINUE, AND RUN\nTHE RISK OF BEING HANGED!\n\nClearly, the time had come when Adams was forced to reach instantly, a\nDECISION which could have cost his life. The majority of men would have\nfound it difficult to reach such a decision. The majority would have sent back an\nevasive reply, but not Adams! He insisted upon Col. Fenton's word of honor, that\nthe Colonel would deliver to the Governor the answer exactly as Adams would\ngive it to him.\n\nAdams' answer, \"Then you may tell Governor Gage that I trust I have long\nsince made my peace with the King of Kings.

And, TELL\nGOVERNOR GAGE IT IS THE ADVICE OF SAMUEL ADAMS TO HIM, no\nlonger to insult the feelings of an exasperated people.\"\n\nComment as to the character of this man seems unnecessary. It must be\nobvious to all who read this astounding message that its sender possessed\nloyalty of the highest order. This is important. (Racketeers and dishonest\npoliticians have prostituted the honor for which such men as Adams died).\n\nWhen Governor Gage received Adams' caustic reply, he flew into a rage,\nand issued a proclamation which read, \"I do, hereby, in his majesty's name, offer\nand promise his most gracious pardon to all persons who shall forthwith lay\ndown their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects, excepting only\nfrom the benefit of such pardon, SAMUEL ADAMS AND JOHN HANCOCK,\nwhose offences are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration\nbut that of condign punishment.\"\n\nAs one might say, in modern slang, Adams and Hancock were \"on the\nspot!\" The threat of the irate Governor forced the two men to reach another\nDECISION, equally as dangerous. They hurriedly called a secret meeting of their\nstaunchest followers. (Here the Master Mind began to take on momentum). After\nthe meeting had been called to order, Adams locked the door, placed the key in\nhis pocket, and informed all present that it was imperative that a Congress of the\nColonists be organized, and that NO MAN SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM\nUNTIL THE DECISION FOR SUCH A CONGRESS HAD BEEN REACHED.\n\nGreat excitement followed. Some weighed the possible consequences of\nsuch radicalism. (Old Man Fear). Some expressed grave doubt as to the wisdom\nof so definite a decision in defiance of the Crown. Locked in that room were TWO\nMEN immune to Fear, blind to the possibility of Failure. Hancock and Adams.\nThrough the influence of their minds, the others were induced to agree that,\nthrough the Correspondence Committee, arrangements should be made for a\nmeeting of the First Continental Congress, to be held in Philadelphia, September\n5, 1774.\n\nRemember this date. It is more important than July 4, 1776. If there had\nbeen no DECISION to hold a Continental Congress, there could have been no\nsigning of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nBefore the first meeting of the new Congress, another leader, in a different\nsection of the country was deep in the throes of publishing a \"Summary View of\nthe Rights of British America.\" He was Thomas Jefferson, of the Province of\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n146\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Inspired by the threat, one of Jefferson's colleagues, Patrick Henry,\nboldly spoke his mind, concluding his remarks with a sentence which shall\nremain forever a classic, \"If this be treason, then make the most of it.\"\n\nIt was such men as these who, without power, without authority, without\nmilitary strength, without money, sat in solemn consideration of the destiny of\nthe colonies, beginning at the opening of the First Continental Congress, and\ncontinuing at intervals for two years— until on June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee\narose, addressed the Chair, and to the startled Assembly made this motion:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I make the motion that these United Colonies are, and of\nright ought to be free and independent states, that they be absolved from all\nallegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them\nand the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be totally dissolved.\"\n\nLee's astounding motion was discussed fervently, and at such length that\nhe began to lose patience. Finally, after days of argument, he again took the floor,\nand declared, in a clear, firm voice, \"Mr. President, we have discussed this issue\nfor days. It is the only course for us to follow. Why, then Sir, do we longer delay?\nWhy still deliberate? Let this happy day give birth to an American Republic. Let\nher arise, not to devastate and to conquer, but to re-establish the reign of peace,\nand of law. The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us. She demands of us a living\nexample of freedom, that may exhibit a contrast, in the felicity of the citizen, to\nthe ever increasing tyranny.\"\n\nBefore his motion was finally voted upon, Lee was called back to Virginia,\nbecause of serious family illness, but before leaving, he placed his cause in the\nhands of his friend, Thomas Jefferson, who promised to fight until favorable\naction was taken. Shortly thereafter the President of the Congress (Hancock),\nappointed Jefferson as Chairman of a Committee to draw up a Declaration of\nIndependence.\n\nLong and hard the Committee labored, on a document which would\nmean, when accepted by the Congress, that EVERY MAN WHO SIGNED IT,\nWOULD BE SIGNING HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT, should the Colonies lose\nin the fight with Great Britain, which was sure to follow.\n\nThe document was drawn, and on June 28, the original draft was read\nbefore the Congress. For several days it was discussed, altered, and made ready.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n147\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

By that DECISION came into existence a nation destined to bring\nto mankind forever, the privilege of making DECISIONS.\n\nBy decisions made in a similar spirit of Faith, and only by such decisions,\ncan men solve their personal problems, and win for themselves high estates of\nmaterial and spiritual wealth. Let us not forget this!\n\nAnalyze the events which led to the Declaration of Independence, and be\nconvinced that this nation, which now holds a position of commanding respect\nand power among all nations of the world, was born of a DECISION created by a\nMaster Mind, consisting of fifty-six men. Note well, the fact that it was their\nDECISION which insured the success of Washington's armies, because the spirit\nof that decision was in the heart of every soldier who fought with him, and\nserved as a spiritual power which recognizes no such thing as FAILURE.\n\nNote, also, (with great personal benefit), that the POWER which gave this\nnation its freedom, is the self-same power that must be used by every individual\nwho becomes self-determining. This POWER is made up of the principles\ndescribed in this book. It will not be difficult to detect, in the story of the\nDeclaration of Independence, at least six of these principles; DESIRE, DECISION,\nFAITH, PERSISTENCE, THE MASTER MIND, and ORGANIZED PLANNING.\n\nThroughout this philosophy will be found the suggestion that thought,\nbacked by strong DESIRE, has a tendency to transmute itself into its physical\nequivalent. Before passing on, I wish to leave with you the suggestion that one\nmay find in this story, and in the story of the organization of the United States\nSteel Corporation, a perfect description of the method by which thought makes\nthis astounding transformation.\n\nIn your search for the secret of the method, do not loo for a miracle,\nbecause you will not find it.

They may be used to bring freedom to a nation, or to accumulate riches.\nThere is no charge save the time necessary to understand and appropriate them.\n\nThose who reach DECISIONS promptly and definitely, know what they\nwant, and generally get it. The leaders in every walk of life DECIDE quickly, and\nfirmly. That is the major reason why they are leaders. The world has the habit of\nmaking room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where\nhe is going.\n\nINDECISION is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on\npermanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and even\nthrough college, without DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. The major weakness of\nall educational systems is that they neither teach nor encourage the habit of\nDEFINITE DECISION.\n\nIt would be beneficial if no college would permit the enrollment of any\nstudent, unless and until the student declared his major purpose in\nmatriculating. It would be of still greater benefit, if every student who enters the\ngraded schools were compelled to accept training in the HABIT OF DECISION,\nand forced to pass a satisfactory examination on this subject before being\npermitted to advance in the grades.\n\nThe habit of INDECISION acquired because of the deficiencies of our\nschool systems, goes with the student into the occupation he chooses . . . IF . . in\nfact, he chooses his occupation. Generally, the youth just out of school seeks any\njob that can be found. He takes the first place he finds, because he has fallen into\nthe habit of INDECISION. Ninety-eight out of every hundred people working for\nwages today, are in the positions they hold, because they lacked the\nDEFINITENESS OF DECISION to PLAN A DEFINITE POSITION, and the\nknowledge of how to choose an employer.\n\nDEFINITENESS OF DECISION always requires courage, sometimes very\ngreat courage. The fifty-six men who signed the Declaration of Independence\nstaked their lives on the DECISION to affix their signatures to that document.\nThe person who reaches a DEFINITE DECISION to procure the particular job,\nand make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his life on that decision; he\nstakes his ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Financial independence, riches, desirable\nbusiness and professional positions are not within reach of the person who\nneglects or refuses to EXPECT, PLAN, and DEMAND these things. The person\nwho desires riches in the same spirit that Samuel Adams desired freedom for the\nColonies, is sure to accumulate wealth.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n149\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This sixth\nsense is \"Creative Imagination.\" The faculty of creative imagination is one which\nthe majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it\nusually happens by mere accident. A relatively small number of people use,\nWITH DELIBERATION AND PURPOSE AFORETHOUGHT, the faculty of\ncreative imagination. Those who use this faculty voluntarily, and with\nunderstanding of its functions, are GENII.\n\nThe faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the finite\nmind of man and Infinite Intelligence. All so-called revelations, referred to in the\nrealm of religion, and all discoveries of basic or new principles in the field of\ninvention, take place through the faculty of creative imagination.\n\nWhen ideas or concepts flash into one's mind, through what is popularly\ncalled a \"hunch,\" they come from one or more of the following sources:—\n\n1. Infinite Intelligence\n2. One's subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense\n\nimpression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain\nthrough any of the five senses\n3. From the mind of some other person who has just released the\n\nthought, or picture of the idea or concept, through conscious\nthought, or\n4. From the other person's subconscious storehouse.\n\nThere are no other KNOWN sources from which \"inspired\" ideas or\n\"hunches\" may be received.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n177\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook? Discover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com |177|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe creative imagination functions best when the mind is vibrating (due\nto some form of mind stimulation) at an exceedingly high rate. That is, when the\nmind is functioning at a rate of vibration higher than that of ordinary, normal\nthought.\n\nWhen brain action has been stimulated, through one or more of the ten\nmind stimulants, it has the effect of lifting the individual far above the horizon of\nordinary thought, and permits him to envision distance, scope, and quality of\nTHOUGHTS not available on the lower plane, such as that occupied while one is\nengaged in the solution of the problems of business and professional routine.\n\nWhen lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind\nstimulation, an individual occupies, relatively, the same position as one who has\nascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see over and beyond the\nhorizon line which limits his vision, while on the ground. Moreover, while on\nthis higher level of thought, the individual is not hampered or bound by any of\nthe stimuli which circumscribe and limit his vision while wrestling with the\nproblems of gaining the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He\nis in a world of thought in which the ORDINARY, work-a-day thoughts have\nbeen as effectively removed as are the hills and valleys and other limitations of\nphysical vision, when he rises in an airplane.\n\nWhile on this exalted plane of THOUGHT, the creative faculty of the mind\nis given freedom for action. The way has been cleared for the sixth sense to\nfunction, it becomes receptive to ideas which could not reach the individual\nunder any other circumstances. The \"sixth sense\" is the faculty which marks the\ndifference between a genius and an ordinary individual.\n\nThe creative faculty becomes more alert and receptive to vibrations,\noriginating outside the individual's subconscious mind, the more this faculty is\nused, and the more the individual relies upon it, and makes demands upon it for\nthought impulses. This faculty can be cultivated and developed only through\nuse.\n\nThat which is known as ones conscience operates entirely through the\nfaculty of the sixth sense.\n\nThe great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great, because they\nacquire the habit of relying upon the \"still small voice\" which speaks from within,\nthrough the faculty of creative imagination. It is a fact well known to people who\nhave \"keen\" imaginations that their best ideas come through so-called \"hunches.\"\n\nThere is a great orator who does not attain to greatness, until he closes his\neyes and begins to rely entirely upon the faculty of Creative Imagination. When\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n178\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Gates, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, created more than\n200 useful patents, many of them basic, through the process of cultivating and\nusing the creative faculty. His method is both significant and interesting to one\ninterested in attaining to the status of genius, in which category Dr. Gates,\nunquestionably belonged. Dr. Gates was one of the really great, though less\npublicized scientists of the world.\n\nIn his laboratory, he had what he called his \"personal communication\nroom.\" It was practically sound proof, and so arranged that all light could be shut\nout. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept a pad of writing paper.\nIn front of the table, on the wall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the\nlights. When Dr. Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through\nhis Creative Imagination, he would go into this room, seat himself at the table,\nshut off the lights, and CONCENTRATE upon the KNOWN factors of the\ninvention on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began\nto \"flash\" into his mind in connection with the UNKNOWN factors of the\ninvention.\n\nOn one occasion, ideas came through so fast that he was forced to write\nfor almost three hours. When the thoughts stopped flowing, and he examined his\nnotes, he found they contained a minute description of principles which bad not\na parallel among the known data of the scientific world.\n\nMoreover, the answer to his problem was intelligently presented in those\nnotes. In this manner Dr. Gates completed over 200 patents, which had been\nbegun, but not completed, by \"half-baked\" brains. Evidence of the truth of this\nstatement is in the United States Patent Office.\n\nDr. Gates earned his living by \"sitting for ideas\" for individuals and\ncorporations. Some of the largest corporations in America paid him substantial\nfees, by the hour, for \"sitting for ideas.\"\n\nThe reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one's\naccumulated experience. Not all knowledge, which one accumulates through\n\"experience,\" is accurate. Ideas received through the creative faculty are much\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n179\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The\nscientific inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates), makes use of both the\nsynthetic and the creative faculties of imagination.\n\nFor example, the scientific inventor, or \"genius, begins an invention by\norganizing and combining the known ideas, or principles accumulated through\nexperience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If he finds this\naccumulated knowledge to be insufficient for the completion of his invention, he\nthen draws upon the sources of knowledge available to him through his creative\nfaculty. The method by which he does this varies with the individual, but this is\nthe sum and substance of his procedure:\n\n1. HE STIMULATES HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON A HIGHERTHAN-AVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or\nsome other stimulant of his choice.\n2. HE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the finished part) of his\ninvention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the\nunfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been\ntaken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL\nthought, and waits for his answer to \"flash\" into his mind.\n\nSometimes the results are both definite and immediate. At other times, the\nresults are negative, depending upon the state of development of the \"sixth\nsense,\" or creative faculty.\n\nMr. Edison tried out more than 10,000 different combinations of ideas\nthrough the synthetic faculty of his imagination before he \"tuned in\" through the\ncreative faculty, and got the answer which perfected the incandescent light. His\nexperience was similar when he produced the talking machine.\n\nThere is plenty of reliable evidence that the faculty of creative imagination\nexists. This evidence is available through accurate analysis of men who have\nbecome leaders in their respective callings, without having had extensive\neducations. Lincoln was a notable example of a great leader who achieved\ngreatness, through the discovery, and use of his faculty of creative imagination.\nHe discovered, and began to use this faculty as the result of the stimulation of\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n180\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Napoleon\nBonaparte was one of these. When inspired by his first wife, Josephine, he was\nirresistible and invincible. When his \"better judgment\" or reasoning faculty\nprompted him to put Josephine aside, he began to decline. His defeat and St.\nHelena were not far distant.\n\nIf good taste would permit, we might easily mention scores of men, well\nknown to the American people, who climbed to great heights of achievement\nunder the stimulating influence of their wives, only to drop back to destruction\nAFTER money and power went to their heads, and they put aside the old wife\nfor a new one. Napoleon was not the only man to discover that sex influence,\nfrom the right source, is more powerful than any substitute of expediency, which\nmay be created by mere reason.\n\nThe human mind responds to stimulation!\nAmong the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of sex.\nWhen harnessed and transmuted, this driving force is capable of lifting men into\nthat higher sphere of thought which enables them to master the sources of worry\nand petty annoyance which beset their pathway on the lower plane.\n\nUnfortunately, only the genii have made the discovery. Others have\naccepted the experience of sex urge, without discovering one of its major\npotentialities— a fact which accounts for the great number of \"others\" as\ncompared to the limited number of genii.\n\nFor the purpose of refreshing the memory, in connection with the facts\navailable from the biographies of certain men, we here present the names of a\nfew men of outstanding achievement, each of whom was known to have been of\na highly sexed nature. The genius which was their's, undoubtedly found its\nsource of power in transmuted sex energy:\n\nGEORGE WASHINGTON\nNAPOLEON BONAPARTE\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON\n\nROBERT BURNS\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n181\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

There never has been, and never\n_will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex._\n\nSurely no one will misunderstand these statements to mean that ALL who\nare highly sexed are genii! Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY when, and\nIF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available, through the\ncreative faculty of the imagination. Chief among the stimuli with which this\n\"stepping up\" of the vibrations may be produced is sex energy. The mere\n_possession of this energy is not sufficient to produce a genius. The energy must be_\n_transmuted from desire for physical contact, into some other form of desire and_\naction, before it will lift one to the status of a genius.\n\nFar from becoming genii, because of great sex desires, the majority of men\n_lower themselves, through misunderstanding and misuse of this great force, to_\nthe status of the lower animals.\n\n**WHY MEN SELDOM SUCCEED BEFORE FORTY**\n\nI discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who\nsucceed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of forty, and more\noften they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond the age of fifty.\nThis fact was so astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n182\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The majority of men never learn that the urge of\nsex has other possibilities, which far transcend in importance, that of mere\nphysical expression. The majority of those who make this discovery, do so after\n_having wasted many years at a period when the sex energy is at its height, prior to_\nthe age of forty-five to fifty. This usually is followed by noteworthy achievement.\n\nThe lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of forty,\nreflect a continued dissipation of energies, which could have been more\nprofitably turned into better channels. Their finer and more powerful emotions\nare sown wildly to the four winds. Out of this habit of the male, grew the term,\n\"sowing his wild oats.\"\n\nThe desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most impelling\nof all the human emotions, and for this very reason this desire, when harnessed\n_and transmuted into action, other than that of physical expression, may raise one_\nto the status of a genius.\n\nOne of America's most able business men frankly admitted that his\nattractive secretary was responsible for most of the plans he created. He admitted\nthat her presence lifted him to heights of creative imagination, such as he could\nexperience under no other stimulus.\n\nOne of the most successful men in America owes most of his success to the\ninfluence of a very charming young woman, who has served as his source of\ninspiration for more than twelve years. Everyone knows the man to whom this\nreference is made, but not everyone knows the REAL SOURCE of his\nachievements.\n\nHistory is not lacking in examples of men who attained to the status of\ngenii, as the result of the use of artificial mind stimulants in the form of alcohol\nand narcotics. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the \"Raven\" while under the influence of\nliquor, \"dreaming dreams that mortal never dared to dream before.\" James\nWhitcomb Riley did his best writing while under the influence of alcohol.\nPerhaps it was thus he saw \"the ordered intermingling of the real and the dream,\nthe mill above the river, and the mist above the stream.\" Robert Burns wrote best\nwhen intoxicated, \"For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, we'll take a cup of kindness\nyet, for Auld Lang Syne.\"\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n183\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Nature has prepared her own potions with which men may safely\nstimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to tune in to\nfine and rare thoughts which come from— no man knows where! No satisfactory\nsubstitute for Nature's stimulants has ever been found.\n\nIt is a fact well known to psychologists that there is a very close\nrelationship between sex desires and spiritual urges— a fact which accounts for\nthe peculiar behavior of people who participate in the orgies known as religious\n\"revivals,\" common among the primitive types.\n\nThe world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by the\nhuman emotions. People are influenced in their actions, not by reason so much as\nby \"feelings.\" The creative faculty of the mind is set into action entirely by\nemotions, and not by cold reason. The most powerful of all human emotions is that\nof sex. There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no\none of them, nor all of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex.\n\nA mind stimulant is any influence which will either temporarily, or\npermanently, increase the vibrations of thought. The ten major stimulants,\ndescribed, are those most commonly resorted to. Through these sources one may\ncommune with Infinite Intelligence, or enter, at will, the storehouse of the\nsubconscious mind, either one's own, or that of another person, a procedure\n_which is all there is of genius._\n\nA teacher, who has trained and directed the efforts of more than 30,000\nsales people, made the astounding discovery that highly sexed men are the most\nefficient salesmen. The explanation is, that the factor of personality known as\n\"personal magnetism\" is nothing more nor less than sex energy. Highly sexed\npeople always have a plentiful supply of magnetism. Through cultivation and\nunderstanding, this vital force may be drawn upon and used to great advantage\nin the relationships between people. This energy may be communicated to others\nthrough the following media:\n\n1. The hand-shake. The touch of the hand indicates, instantly, the presence of\nmagnetism, or the lack of it.\n2. The tone of voice. Magnetism, or sex energy, is the factor with which the\nvoice may be colored, or made musical and charming.\n3. Posture and carriage of the body. Highly sexed people move briskly, and\nwith grace and ease.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n184\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Highly sexed people mix the emotion of sex\nwith their thoughts, or may do so at will, and in that way, may influence those\naround them.\n5. Body adornment. People who are highly sexed are usually very careful\nabout their personal appearance. They usually select clothing of a style becoming\nto their personality, physique, complexion, etc.\n\nWhen employing salesmen, the more capable sales manager looks for the\nquality of personal magnetism as the first requirement of a salesman. People who\nlack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with\nenthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important requisites in\nsalesmanship, no matter what one is selling.\n\nThe public speaker, orator, preacher, lawyer, or salesman who is lacking\nin sex energy is a \"flop,\" as far as being able to influence others is concerned.\nCouple with this the fact, that most people can be influenced only through an\nappeal to their emotions, and you will understand the importance of sex energy\nas a part of the salesman's native ability. Master salesmen attain the status of\nmastery in selling, because they, either consciously, or unconsciously, transmute\nthe energy of sex into SALES ENTHUSIASM! In this statement may be found a\nvery practical suggestion as to the actual meaning of sex transmutation.\n\nThe salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and\ndirect it in sales effort with as much enthusiasm and determination as he would\napply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex transmutation, whether\nhe knows it or not. The majority of salesmen who transmute their sex energy do\nso without being in the least aware of what they are doing, or how they are doing\nit.\n\nTransmutation of sex energy calls for more will power than the average\nperson cares to use for this purpose. Those who find it difficult to summon willpower sufficient for transmutation, may gradually acquire this ability. Though\nthis requires will-power, the reward for the practice is more than worth the\neffort.\n\nThe entire subject of sex is one with which the majority of people appear\nto be unpardonably ignorant. The urge of sex has been grossly misunderstood,\nslandered, and burlesqued by the ignorant and the evil minded, for so long that\nthe very word sex is seldom used in polite society. Men and women who are\nknown to be blessed— yes, BLESSED—with highly sexed natures, are usually\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n185\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Instead of being called\nblessed, they are usually called cursed.\n\nMillions of people, even in this age of enlightenment, have inferiority\ncomplexes which they developed because of this false belief that a highly sexed\nnature is a curse. These statements, of the virtue of sex energy, should not be\nconstrued as justification for the libertine. The emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY\nwhen used intelligently, and with discrimination. It may be misused, and often\nis, to such an extent that it debases, instead of enriches, both body and mind. The\nbetter use of this power is the burden of this chapter.\n\nIt seemed quite significant to the author, when he made the discovery that\npractically every great leader, whom he had the privilege of analyzing, was a\nman whose achievements were largely inspired by a woman. In many instances,\nthe \"woman in the case\" was a modest, self-denying wife, of whom the public\nhad heard but little or nothing. In a few instances, the source of inspiration has\nbeen traced to the \"other woman.\" Perhaps such cases may not be entirely\nunknown to you.\n\nIntemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in habits\nof drinking and eating. In this age in which we live, an age which began with the\nworld war, intemperance in habits of sex is common. This orgy of indulgence\nmay account for the shortage of great leaders. No man can avail himself of the\nforces of his creative imagination, while dissipating them. Man is the only\ncreature on earth which violates Nature's purpose in this connection. Every other\nanimal indulges its sex nature in moderation, and with purpose which\nharmonizes with the laws of nature. Every other animal responds to the call of\nsex only in \"season.\" Man's inclination is to declare \"open season.\"\n\nEvery intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through\nalcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital\norgans of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that\nover indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as\ndetrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor.\n\nA sex-mad man is not essentially different than a dope-mad man! Both\nhave lost control over their faculties of reason and will-power. Sexual\noverindulgence may not only destroy reason and will-power, but it may also\nlead to either temporary, or permanent insanity. Many cases of hypochondria\n(imaginary illness) grow out of habits developed in ignorance of the true\nfunction of sex.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n186\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The\nconspiracy of mystery and silence has had the same effect upon the minds of\nyoung people that the psychology of prohibition had. The result has been\nincreased curiosity, and desire to acquire more knowledge on this \"verboten\"\nsubject; and to the shame of all lawmakers, and most physicians— by training\nbest qualified to educate youth on that subject-information has not been easily\navailable.\n\nSeldom does an individual enter upon highly creative effort in any field of\nendeavor before the age of forty. The average man reaches the period of his\ngreatest capacity to create between forty and sixty. These statements are based\nupon analysis of thousands of men and women who have been carefully\nobserved. They should be encouraging to those who fail to arrive before the age\nof forty, and to those who become frightened at the approach of \"old age,\"\naround the forty-year mark. The years between forty and fifty are, as a rule, the\nmost fruitful. Man should approach this age, not with fear and trembling, but\nwith hope and eager anticipation.\n\nIf you want evidence that most men do not begin to do their best work\nbefore the age of forty, study the records of the most successful men known to\nthe American people, and you will find it. Henry Ford had not \"hit his pace\" of\nachievement until he had passed the age of forty. Andrew Carnegie was well\npast forty before he began to reap the reward of his efforts. James J. Hill was still\nrunning a telegraph key at the age of forty. His stupendous achievements took\nplace after that age. Biographies of American industrialists and financiers are\nfilled with evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age\nof man.\n\nBetween the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn (if he ever\nlearns), the art of sex transmutation. This discovery is generally accidental, and\nmore often than otherwise, the man who makes it is totally unconscious of his\ndiscovery. He may observe that his powers of achievement have increased\naround the age of thirty-five to forty, but in most cases, he is not familiar with the\ncause of this change; that Nature begins to harmonize the emotions of love and\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n187\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

When the emotion of love begins to mix itself with\nthe emotion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy of\njudgment, and balance. What person, who has attained to the age of forty, is so\nunfortunate as to be unable to analyze these statements, and to corroborate them\nby his own experience?\n\nWhen driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the\nemotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great achievement, but\nhis actions may be disorganized, distorted, and totally destructive. When driven\nby his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may\nsteal, cheat, and even commit murder. But when the emotion of LOVE is mixed\nwith the emotion of sex, that same man will guide his actions with more sanity,\nbalance, and reason.\n\nCriminologists have discovered that the most hardened criminals can be\nreformed through the influence of a woman's love. There is no record of a\ncriminal having been reformed solely through the sex influence. These facts are\nwell known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at all, through the heart,\nor the emotional side of man, not through his head, or reasoning side.\nReformation means, \"a change of heart.\" It does not mean a \"change of head.\" A\nman may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to\navoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but GENUINE REFORMATION\ncomes only through a change of heart—through a DESIRE to change.\n\nLove, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to\nheights of super achievement. Love is the emotion which serves as a safety valve,\nand insures balance, poise, and constructive effort. When combined, these three\nemotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius. There are genii, however, who\nknow but little of the emotion of love. Most of them may be found engaged in\nsome form of action which is destructive, or at least, not based upon justice and\nfairness toward others. If good taste would permit, a dozen genii could be named\nin the field of industry and finance, who ride ruthlessly over the rights of their\nfellow men. They seem totally lacking in conscience. The reader can easily\nsupply his own list of such men.\n\nThe emotions are states of mind. Nature has provided man with a\n\"chemistry of the mind\" which operates in a manner similar to the principles of\nchemistry of matter. It is a well known fact that, through the aid of chemistry of\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n188\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The emotions\nmay, likewise, be combined so as to create a deadly poison. The emotions of sex\nand jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast.\n\nThe presence of any one or more of the destructive emotions in the human\nmind, through the chemistry of the mind, sets up a poison which may destroy\none's sense of justice and fairness. In extreme cases, the presence of any\ncombination of these emotions in the mind may destroy one's reason.\n\nThe road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex,\nlove, and romance. Briefly, the process may be stated as follows:\n\nEncourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in\none's mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The\nmind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it.\nThrough the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any\nemotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through\nthe power of will, is not difficult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The\nsecret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any\nnegative emotion presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a\npositive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one's\nthoughts.\n\nTHERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH\nVOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT! A man may attain to great heights of financial or\nbusiness achievement, solely by the driving force of sex energy, but history is\nfilled with evidence that he may, and usually does, carry with him certain traits\nof character which rob him of the ability to either hold, or enjoy his fortune. This\nis worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a truth, the\nknowledge of which may be helpful to women as well as men. Ignorance of this\nhas cost thousands of people their privilege of HAPPINESS, even though they\npossessed riches.\n\nThe emotions of love and sex leave their unmistakable marks upon the\nfeatures. Moreover, these signs are so visible, that all who wish may read them.\nThe man who is driven by the storm of passion, based upon sex desires alone,\nplainly advertises that fact to the entire world, by the expression of his eyes, and\nthe lines of his face. The emotion of love, when mixed with the emotion of sex,\nsoftens, modifies, and beautifies the facial expression. No character analyst is\nneeded to tell you this—you may observe it for yourself.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n189\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

It leaves its impress upon one's very soul, even after the fire has\nbeen subdued by time and circumstance.\n\nMemories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and influence long after\nthe source of stimulation has faded. There is nothing new in this. Every person,\nwho has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves enduring traces\nupon the human heart. The effect of love endures, because love is spiritual in\nnature. The man who cannot be stimulated to great heights of achievement by\nlove, is hopeless—he is dead, though he may seem to live.\n\nEven the memories of love are sufficient to lift one to a higher plane of\ncreative effort. The major force of love may spend itself and pass away, like a fire\nwhich has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible marks as evidence that\nit passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater\nlove.\n\nGo back into your yesterdays, at times, and bathe your mind in the\nbeautiful memories of past love. It will soften the influence of the present worries\nand annoyances. It will give you a source of escape from the unpleasant realities\nof life, and maybe—who knows?—your mind will yield to you, during this\ntemporary retreat into the world of fantasy, ideas, or plans which may change\nthe entire financial or spiritual status of your life.\n\nIf you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have \"loved and lost,\"\nperish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is\nwhimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes\nwhen it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it\nremains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring\nit back.\n\nDismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come\nand go, times without number, but there are no two love experiences which\naffect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually is, one love\nexperience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than all the others, but all\nlove experiences are beneficial, except to the person who becomes resentful and\ncynical when love makes its departure.\n\nThere should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if\npeople understood the difference between the emotions of love and sex. The\nmajor difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No experience,\nwhich touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful,\nexcept through ignorance, or jealousy.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n190\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

It brings one into\ncommunion with Infinite Intelligence. When mixed with the emotions of\nromance and sex, it may lead one far up the ladder of creative effort. The\nemotions of love, sex, and romance, are sides of the eternal triangle of\nachievement-building genius. Nature creates genii through no other force.\n\nLove is an emotion with many sides, shades, and colors. The love which\none feels for parents, or children is quite different from that which one feels for\none's sweetheart. The one is mixed with the emotion of sex, while the other is\nnot.\n\nThe love which one feels in true friendship is not the same as that felt for\none's sweetheart, parents, or children, but it, too, is a form of love.\n\nThen, there is the emotion of love for things inanimate, such as the love of\nNature's handiwork. But the most intense and burning of all these various kinds\nof love, is that experienced in the blending of the emotions of love and sex.\nMarriages, not blessed with the eternal affinity of love, properly balanced and\nproportioned, with sex, cannot be happy ones—and seldom endure. Love, alone,\nwill not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two\nbeautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind,\nclosest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane.\n\nWhen the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the\nobstructions between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence are\nremoved.\n\nThen a genius has been born!\nWhat a different story is this, than those usually associated with the\nemotion of sex. Here is an interpretation of the emotion which lifts it out of the\ncommonplace, and makes of it potter's clay in the hands of God, from which He\nfashions all that is beautiful and inspiring. It is an interpretation which would,\nwhen properly understood, bring harmony out of the chaos which exists in too\nmany marriages. The disharmonies often expressed in the form of nagging, may\nusually be traced to lack of knowledge on the subject of sex. Where love, romance\nand the proper understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is\nno disharmony between married people.\n\nFortunate is the husband whose wife understands the true relationship\nbetween the emotions of love, sex, and romance. When motivated by this holy\ntriumvirate, no form of labor is burdensome, because even the most lowly form\nof effort takes on the nature of a labor of love.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n191\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The \"making\" and \"breaking\" is\nthe result of the wife's understanding, or lack of understanding of the emotions\nof love, sex, and romance.\n\nDespite the fact that men are polygamous, by the very nature of their\nbiological inheritance, it is true that no woman has as great an influence on a\nman as his wife, unless he is married to a woman totally unsuited to his nature. If\na woman permits her husband to lose interest in her, and become more\ninterested in other women, it is usually because of her ignorance, or indifference\ntoward the subjects of sex, love, and romance. This statement presupposes, of\ncourse, that genuine love once existed between a man and his wife. The facts are\nequally applicable to a man who permits his wife's interest in him to die.\n\nMarried people often bicker over a multitude of trivialities. If these are\nanalyzed accurately, the real cause of the trouble will often be found to be\nindifference, or ignorance on these subjects.\n\n_Man's greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman! The hunter who_\nexcelled during prehistoric days, before the dawn of civilization, did so, because\nof his desire to appear great in the eyes of woman. Man's nature has not changed\nin this respect. The \"hunter\" of today brings home no skins of wild animals, but\nhe indicates his desire for her favor by supplying fine clothes, motor cars, and\nwealth. Man has the same desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of\ncivilization. The only thing that has changed, is his method of pleasing. Men who\naccumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights of power and fame, do so,\nmainly, to satisfy their desire to please women.\n\nTake women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most\nmen. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to\n_make or break a man._\n\nThe woman who understands man's nature and tactfully caters to it, need\nhave no fear of competition from other women. Men may be \"giants\" with\nindomitable will-power when dealing with other men, but they are easily\nmanaged by the women of their choice.\n\nMost men will not admit that they are easily influenced by the women\nthey prefer, because it is in the nature of the male to want to be recognized as the\nstronger of the species. Moreover, the intelligent woman recognizes this \"manly\ntrait\" and very wisely makes no issue of it.\n\nSome men know that they are being influenced by the women of their\nchoice— their wives, sweethearts, mothers or sisters— but they tactfully refrain\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n192\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

It describes WHAT TO DO, also,\nHOW TO DO IT!\n\nIt presents complete instructions on HOW TO SELL YOUR PERSONAL\nSERVICES.\n\nIt provides you with a perfect system of self-analysis that will readily\ndisclose what has been standing between you and \"the big money\" in the past.\n\nIt describes the famous Andrew Carnegie formula of personal\nachievement by which he accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars for\nhimself and made no fewer than a score of millionaires of men to whom he\ntaught his secret.\n\nPerhaps you do not need all that is to be found in the book— no one of the\n500 men from whose experiences it was written did— but you may need ONE\nIDEA, PLAN OR SUGGESTION to start you toward your goal. Somewhere in\nthe book you will find this needed stimulus.\n\nThe book was inspired by Andrew Carnegie, after he had made his\nmillions and retired. It was written by the man to whom Carnegie disclosed the\nastounding secret of his riches— the same man to whom the 500 wealthy men\nrevealed the source of their riches.\n\nIn this volume will be found the thirteen principles of money-making\nessential to every person who accumulates sufficient money to guarantee\nfinancial independence. It is estimated that the research which went into the\npreparation, before the book was written, or could be written— research\ncovering more than twenty-five years of continuous effort— could not be\nduplicated at a cost of less than $100,000.00.\n\nMoreover, the knowledge contained in the book never can be duplicated,\nat any cost, for the reason that more than half of the 500 men who supplied the\ninformation it brings have passed on.\n\n_Riches cannot always be measured in money!_\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n8\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Remember this, as you read.\nIndecision crystalizes into DOUBT, the two blend and become FEAR! The\n\"blending\" process often is slow. This is one reason why these three enemies are\nso dangerous. They germinate and grow without their presence being observed.\n\nThe remainder of this chapter describes an end which must be attained\nbefore the philosophy, as a whole, can be put into practical use. It also analyzes a\ncondition which has, but lately, reduced huge numbers of people to poverty, and\nit states a truth which must be understood by all who accumulate riches, whether\nmeasured in terms of money or a state of mind of far greater value than money.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to turn the spotlight of attention upon the cause\nand the cure of the six basic fears. Before we can master an enemy, we must\nknow its name, its habits, and its place of abode. As you read, analyze yourself\ncarefully, and determine which, if any, of the six common fears have attached\nthemselves to you.\n\nDo not be deceived by the habits of these subtle enemies. Sometimes they\nremain hidden in the subconscious mind, where they are difficult to locate, and\nstill more difficult to eliminate.\n\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n\n218\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This collaboration is essential for creating effective plans.\n\n3. **Definite Plans**:\n   - The chapter stresses the need for definite and practical plans. It suggests that individuals should not only create plans but also be flexible enough to adapt and change them if they do not yield the desired results.\n\n4. **Meeting Regularly**:\n   - It advises meeting with the Master Mind group regularly to discuss progress, refine plans, and ensure everyone is aligned with the goals.\n\n5. **Harmony and Cooperation**:\n   - Maintaining harmony within the group is crucial.
