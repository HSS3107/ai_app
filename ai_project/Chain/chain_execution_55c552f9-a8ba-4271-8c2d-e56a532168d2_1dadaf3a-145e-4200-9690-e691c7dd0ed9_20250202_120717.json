You will now be instructed\nhow to build plans which will be practical, viz:—\n\n(a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the\ncreation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money\n— making use of the \"Master Mind\" principle described in a later chapter.\n(Compliance with this instruction is absolutely essential. Do not neglect it.)\n\n(b) Before forming your \"Master Mind\" alliance, decide what advantages,\nand benefits, you may offer the individual members of your group, in return for\ntheir cooperation. No one will work indefinitely without some form of\ncompensation. No intelligent person will either request or expect another to\nwork without adequate compensation, although this may not always be in the\nform of money.\n\n(c) Arrange to meet with the members of your \"Master Mind\" group at\nleast twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected\nthe necessary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n100\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

If you fail to carry out this instruction to the letter,\nyou may expect to meet with failure. The \"Master Mind\" principle cannot obtain\nwhere PERFECT HARMONY does not prevail.\n\nKeep in mind these facts:—\nFirst. You are engaged in an undertaking of major importance to you. To be sure\nof success, you must have plans which are faultless.\n\nSecond. You must have the advantage of the experience, education, native ability\nand imagination of other minds. This is in harmony with the methods followed\nby every person who has accumulated a great fortune.\n\nNo individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and\nknowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the\ncooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to\naccumulate wealth, should be the joint creation of yourself and every other\nmember of your \"Master Mind\" group. You may originate your own plans, either\nin whole or in part, but SEE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE CHECKED, AND\nAPPROVED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR \"MASTER MIND\" ALLIANCE.\n\nIf the first plan which you adopt does not work successfully, replace it\nwith a new plan, if this new plan fails to work, replace it, in turn with still\nanother, and so on, until you find a plan which DOES WORK. Right here is the\npoint at which the majority of men meet with failure, because of their lack of\nPERSISTENCE in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.\n\nThe most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money—\nnor in any other undertaking— without plans which are practical and workable.\nJust keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary\ndefeat is not permanent failure. It may only mean that your plans have not been\nsound. Build other plans. Start all over again.\n\nThomas A. Edison \"failed\" ten thousand times before he perfected the\nincandescent electric light bulb. That is— he met with temporary defeat ten\nthousand times, before his efforts were crowned with success.\n\nTemporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that\nthere is something wrong with your plan. Millions of men go through life in\nmisery and poverty, because they lack a sound plan through which to\naccumulate a fortune.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n101\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

A\nthousand men could be pointed out, each with a better education than Ford's, yet\neach of whom lives in poverty, because he does not possess the RIGHT plan for\nthe accumulation of money.\n\nYour achievement can be no greater than your PLANS are sound. That\nmay seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true. Samuel Insull lost his\nfortune of over one hundred million dollars. The Insull fortune was built on\nplans which were sound. The business depression forced Mr. Insull to CHANGE\nHIS PLANS; and the CHANGE brought \"temporary defeat,\" because his new\nplans were NOT SOUND. Mr. Insull is now an old man, he may, consequently,\naccept \"failure\" instead of \"temporary defeat,\" but if his experience turns out to\nbe FAILURE, it will be for the reason that he lacks the fire of PERSISTENCE to\nrebuild his plans.\n\nNo man is ever whipped, until he QUITS— in his own mind.\nThis fact will be repeated many times, because it is so easy to \"take the\ncount\" at the first sign of defeat.\n\nJames J. Hill met with temporary defeat when he first endeavored to raise\nthe necessary capital to build a railroad from the East to the West, but he, too\nturned defeat into victory through new plans.\n\nHenry Ford met with temporary defeat, not only at the beginning of his\nautomobile career, but after he had gone far toward the top. He created new\nplans, and went marching on to financial victory.\n\nWe see men who have accumulated great fortunes, but we often recognize\nonly their triumph, overlooking the temporary defeats which they had to\nsurmount before \"arriving.\"\n\nNO FOLLOWER OF THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT\nTO ACCUMULATE A FORTUNE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING \"TEMPORARY\nDEFEAT.\" When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound,\nrebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal. If you give\nup before your goal has been reached, you are a \"quitter.\"\n\nA QUITTER NEVER WINS—AND— A WINNER NEVER QUITS.\nLift this sentence out, write it on a piece of paper in letters an inch high,\nand place it where you will see it every night before you go to sleep, and every\nmorning before you go to work.\n\nWhen you begin to select members for your \"Master Mind\" group,\nendeavor to select those who do not take defeat seriously.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n102\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This chapter will describe the method by which an individual may\nattain and apply POWER.\n\nPOWER may be defined as \"organized and intelligently directed\nKNOWLEDGE.\" Power, as the term is here used, refers to ORGANIZED effort,\nsufficient to enable an individual to transmute DESIRE into its monetary\nequivalent. ORGANIZED effort is produced through the coordination of effort of\ntwo or more people, who work toward a DEFINITE end, in a spirit of harmony.\n\nPOWER IS REQUIRED FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF MONEY!\nPOWER IS NECESSARY FOR THE RETENTION OF MONEY AFTER IT HAS\nBEEN ACCUMULATED!\n\nLet us ascertain how power may be acquired. If power is \"organized\nknowledge,\" let us examine the sources of knowledge:\n\na. INFINITE INTELLIGENCE. This source of knowledge\nmay be contacted through the procedure described in another\nchapter, with the aid of Creative Imagination.\n\nb. ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE. The accumulated\nexperience of man, (or that portion of it which has been organized\nand recorded), may be found in any well-equipped public library.\nAn important part of this accumulated experience is taught in\npublic schools and colleges, where it has been classified and\norganized.\n\nc.

It may be\nconverted into POWER by organizing it into definite PLANS and by expressing\nthose plans in terms of ACTION.\n\nExamination of the three major sources of knowledge will readily disclose\nthe difficulty an individual would have, if he depended upon his efforts alone, in\nassembling knowledge and expressing it through definite plans in terms of\nACTION. If his plans are comprehensive, and if they contemplate large\nproportions, he must, generally, induce others to cooperate with him, before he\ncan inject into them the necessary element of POWER.\n\nGAINING POWER THROUGH THE '' MASTER MIND\"\n\nThe \"Master Mind\" may be defined as: \"Coordination of knowledge and\neffort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of\na definite purpose.\"\n\nNo individual may have great power without availing himself of the\n\"Master Mind.\" In a preceding chapter, instructions were given for the creation of\nPLANS for the purpose of translating DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. If\nyou carry out these instructions with PERSISTENCE and intelligence, and use\ndiscrimination in the selection of your \"Master Mind\" group, your objective will\nhave been half-way reached, even before you begin to recognize it.\n\nSo you may better understand the \"intangible\" potentialities of power\navailable to you, through a properly chosen \"Master Mind\" group, we will here\nexplain the two characteristics of the Master Mind principle, one of which is\neconomic in nature, and the other psychic. The economic feature is obvious.\nEconomic advantages may be created by any person who surrounds himself with\nthe advice, counsel, and personal cooperation of a group of men who are willing\nto lend him wholehearted aid, in a spirit of PERFECT HARMONY. This form of\ncooperative alliance has been the basis of nearly every great fortune. Your\nunderstanding of this great truth may definitely determine your financial status.\n\nThe psychic phase of the Master Mind principle is much more abstract,\nmuch more difficult to comprehend, because it has reference to the spiritual\nforces with which the human race, as a whole, is not well acquainted.

It is a well known fact that matter may be\nbroken down into units of molecules, atoms, and electrons. There are units of\nmatter which may be isolated, separated, and analyzed.\n\nLikewise, there are units of energy.\nThe human mind is a form of energy, a part of it being spiritual in nature.\nWhen the minds of two people are coordinated in a SPIRIT OF HARMONY, the\nspiritual units of energy of each mind form an affinity, which constitutes the\n\"psychic\" phase of the Master Mind.\n\nThe Master Mind principle, or rather the economic feature of it, was first\ncalled to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, over twenty-five years ago.\nDiscovery of this principle was responsible for the choice of my life's work.\n\nMr. Carnegie's Master Mind group consisted of a staff of approximately\nfifty men, with whom he surrounded himself, for the DEFINITE PURPOSE of\nmanufacturing and marketing steel. He attributed his entire fortune to the\nPOWER he accumulated through this \"Master Mind.\"\n\nAnalyze the record of any man who has accumulated a great fortune, and\nmany of those who have accumulated modest fortunes, and you will find that\nthey have either consciously, or unconsciously employed the \"Master Mind\"\nprinciple.\n\nGREAT POWER CAN BE ACCUMULATED THROUGH NO OTHER\nPRINCIPLE!\n\nENERGY is Nature's universal set of building blocks, out of which she\nconstructs every material thing in the universe, including man, and every form of\nanimal and vegetable life. Through a process which only Nature completely\nunderstands, she translates energy into matter.\n\nNature's building blocks are available to man, in the energy involved in\nTHINKING! Man's brain may be compared to an electric battery. It absorbs\nenergy from the ether, which permeates every atom of matter, and fills the entire\nuniverse.\n\nIt is a well known fact that a group of electric batteries will provide more\nenergy than a single battery. It is also a well known fact that an individual\nbattery will provide energy in proportion to the number and capacity of the cells\nit contains.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n169\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This accounts for the fact that\nsome brains are more efficient than others, and leads to this significant statement\n—a group of brains coordinated (or connected) in a spirit of harmony, will\nprovide more thought-energy than a single brain, just as a group of electric\nbatteries will provide more energy than a single battery.\n\nThrough this metaphor it becomes immediately obvious that the Master\nMind principle holds the secret of the POWER wielded by men who surround\nthemselves with other men of brains.",

By that DECISION came into existence a nation destined to bring\nto mankind forever, the privilege of making DECISIONS.\n\nBy decisions made in a similar spirit of Faith, and only by such decisions,\ncan men solve their personal problems, and win for themselves high estates of\nmaterial and spiritual wealth. Let us not forget this!\n\nAnalyze the events which led to the Declaration of Independence, and be\nconvinced that this nation, which now holds a position of commanding respect\nand power among all nations of the world, was born of a DECISION created by a\nMaster Mind, consisting of fifty-six men. Note well, the fact that it was their\nDECISION which insured the success of Washington's armies, because the spirit\nof that decision was in the heart of every soldier who fought with him, and\nserved as a spiritual power which recognizes no such thing as FAILURE.\n\nNote, also, (with great personal benefit), that the POWER which gave this\nnation its freedom, is the self-same power that must be used by every individual\nwho becomes self-determining. This POWER is made up of the principles\ndescribed in this book. It will not be difficult to detect, in the story of the\nDeclaration of Independence, at least six of these principles; DESIRE, DECISION,\nFAITH, PERSISTENCE, THE MASTER MIND, and ORGANIZED PLANNING.\n\nThroughout this philosophy will be found the suggestion that thought,\nbacked by strong DESIRE, has a tendency to transmute itself into its physical\nequivalent. Before passing on, I wish to leave with you the suggestion that one\nmay find in this story, and in the story of the organization of the United States\nSteel Corporation, a perfect description of the method by which thought makes\nthis astounding transformation.\n\nIn your search for the secret of the method, do not loo for a miracle,\nbecause you will not find it.

They may be used to bring freedom to a nation, or to accumulate riches.\nThere is no charge save the time necessary to understand and appropriate them.\n\nThose who reach DECISIONS promptly and definitely, know what they\nwant, and generally get it. The leaders in every walk of life DECIDE quickly, and\nfirmly. That is the major reason why they are leaders. The world has the habit of\nmaking room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where\nhe is going.\n\nINDECISION is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on\npermanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and even\nthrough college, without DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. The major weakness of\nall educational systems is that they neither teach nor encourage the habit of\nDEFINITE DECISION.\n\nIt would be beneficial if no college would permit the enrollment of any\nstudent, unless and until the student declared his major purpose in\nmatriculating. It would be of still greater benefit, if every student who enters the\ngraded schools were compelled to accept training in the HABIT OF DECISION,\nand forced to pass a satisfactory examination on this subject before being\npermitted to advance in the grades.\n\nThe habit of INDECISION acquired because of the deficiencies of our\nschool systems, goes with the student into the occupation he chooses . . . IF . . in\nfact, he chooses his occupation. Generally, the youth just out of school seeks any\njob that can be found. He takes the first place he finds, because he has fallen into\nthe habit of INDECISION. Ninety-eight out of every hundred people working for\nwages today, are in the positions they hold, because they lacked the\nDEFINITENESS OF DECISION to PLAN A DEFINITE POSITION, and the\nknowledge of how to choose an employer.\n\nDEFINITENESS OF DECISION always requires courage, sometimes very\ngreat courage. The fifty-six men who signed the Declaration of Independence\nstaked their lives on the DECISION to affix their signatures to that document.\nThe person who reaches a DEFINITE DECISION to procure the particular job,\nand make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his life on that decision; he\nstakes his ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Financial independence, riches, desirable\nbusiness and professional positions are not within reach of the person who\nneglects or refuses to EXPECT, PLAN, and DEMAND these things. The person\nwho desires riches in the same spirit that Samuel Adams desired freedom for the\nColonies, is sure to accumulate wealth.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n149\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The information here conveyed will\nbe of practical help to any person having any form of personal services to\nmarket, but it will be of priceless benefit to those who aspire to leadership in\ntheir chosen occupations.\n\nIntelligent planning is essential for success in any undertaking designed to\naccumulate riches. Here will be found detailed instructions to those who must\nbegin the accumulation of riches by selling personal services.\n\nIt should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes\nbegan in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of\nIDEAS. What else, except ideas and personal services, would one not possessed\nof property have to give in return for riches?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of people in the world. One type is\nknown as LEADERS, and the other as FOLLOWERS. Decide at the outset\nwhether you intend to become a leader in your chosen calling, or remain a\nfollower. The difference in compensation is vast. The follower cannot reasonably\nexpect the compensation to which a leader is entitled, although many followers\nmake the mistake of expecting such pay.\n\nIt is no disgrace to be a follower. On the other hand, it is no credit to\nremain a follower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They\nbecame great leaders because they were INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS. With few\nexceptions, the man who cannot follow a leader intelligently, cannot become an\nefficient leader. The man who can follow a leader most efficiently, is usually the\nman who develops into leadership most rapidly.

UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's\noccupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks selfconfidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a\nleader very long.\n\n2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never\ncontrol others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the\nmore intelligent will emulate.\n\n3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no\nleader can command and retain the respect of his followers.\n\n4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions,\nshows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.\n\n5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work,\nand work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite\nplans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on\nthe rocks.\n\n6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties\nof leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do\nmore than he requires of his followers.\n\n7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become\na successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a\nleader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality.\n\n8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be\nin sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their\nproblems.\n\n9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of\ndetails of the leader's position.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n104\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The successful\nleader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the\nshortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not\nremain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself\nincompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.\n\n11. COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply\nthe principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the\nsame. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION.\n\nThere are two forms of Leadership. The first, and by far the most effective,\nis LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The\nsecond is LEADERSHIP BY FORCE, without the consent and sympathy of the\nfollowers.\n\nHistory is filled with evidences that Leadership by Force cannot endure.\nThe downfall and disappearance of \"Dictators\" and kings is significant. It means\nthat people will not follow forced leadership indefinitely.\n\nThe world has just entered a new era of relationship between leaders and\nfollowers, which very clearly calls for new leaders, and a new brand of\nleadership in business and industry. Those who belong to the old school of\nleadership-by-force, must acquire an understanding of the new brand of\nleadership (cooperation) or be relegated to the rank and file of the followers.\nThere is no other way out for them.\n\nThe relationship of employer and employee, or of leader and follower, in\nthe future, will be one of mutual cooperation, based upon an equitable division\nof the profits of business. In the future, the relationship of employer and\nemployee will be more like a partnership than it has been in the past.\n\nNapoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, the Czar of Russia, and the King\nof Spain were examples of leadership by force. Their leadership passed. Without\nmuch difficulty, one might point to the prototypes of these ex-leaders, among the\nbusiness, financial, and labor leaders of America who have been dethroned or\nslated to go. Leadership-by-consent of the followers is the only brand which can\nendure!\n\nMen may follow the forced leadership temporarily, but they will not do so\nwillingly.\n\nThe new brand of LEADERSHIP will embrace the eleven factors of\nleadership, described in this chapter, as well as some other factors.

The depression was prolonged, largely, because the world\nlacked LEADERSHIP of the new brand. At the end of the depression, the\ndemand for leaders who are competent to apply the new methods of leadership\nhas greatly exceeded the supply. Some of the old type of leaders will reform and\nadapt themselves to the new brand of leadership, but generally speaking, the\nworld will have to look for new timber for its leadership.

This is no mere statement of a\ntheory— it is a fact.\n\nPROCRASTINATION, the opposite of DECISION, is a common enemy\nwhich practically every man must conquer.\n\nYou will have an opportunity to test your capacity to reach quick and\n_definite DECISIONS when you finish reading this book, and are ready to begin_\nputting into ACTION the principles which it describes.\n\nAnalysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well\nbeyond the million dollar mark, disclosed the fact that every one of them had the\nhabit of REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY, and of changing these decisions\nSLOWLY, if, and when they were changed. People who fail to accumulate\nmoney, without exception, have the habit of reaching decisions, IF AT ALL, very\n_slowly, and of changing these decisions quickly and often._\n\nOne of Henry Ford's most outstanding qualities is his habit of reaching\ndecisions quickly and definitely, and changing them slowly. This quality is so\npronounced in Mr. Ford, that it has given him the reputation of being obstinate.\nIt was this quality which prompted Mr. Ford to continue to manufacture his\nfamous Model \"T\" (the world's ugliest car), when all of his advisors, and many of\nthe purchasers of the car, were urging him to change it.\n\nPerhaps, Mr. Ford delayed too long in making the change, but the other\nside of the story is, that Mr. Ford's firmness of decision yielded a huge fortune,\nbefore the change in model became necessary. There is but little doubt that Mr.\nFord's habit of definiteness of decision assumes the proportion of obstinacy, but\nthis quality is preferable to slowness in reaching decisions and quickness in\nchanging them.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n140\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

They permit\nthe newspapers and the \"gossiping\" neighbors to do their \"thinking\" for them.\n\"Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of\nopinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are\ninfluenced by \"opinions\" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in\nany undertaking, much less in that of transmuting YOUR OWN DESIRE into\nmoney.\n\nIf you are influenced by the opinions of others, you will have no DESIRE\nof your own.\n\nKeep your own counsel, when you begin to put into practice the\nprinciples described here, by reaching your own decisions and following them.\nTake no one into your confidence, EXCEPT the members of your \"Master Mind\"\ngroup, and be very sure in your selection of this group, that you choose ONLY\nthose who will be in COMPLETE SYMPATHY AND HARMONY WITH YOUR\nPURPOSE.\n\nClose friends and relatives, while not meaning to do so, often handicap\none through \"opinions\" and sometimes through ridicule, which is meant to be\nhumorous. Thousands of men and women carry inferiority complexes with them\nall through life, because some well-meaning, but ignorant person destroyed their\nconfidence through \"opinions\" or ridicule.\n\nYou have a brain and mind of your own. USE IT, and reach your own\ndecisions. If you need facts or information from other people, to enable you to\nreach decisions, as you probably will in many instances; acquire these facts or\nsecure the information you need quietly, without disclosing your purpose.\n\nIt is characteristic of people who have but a smattering or a veneer of\nknowledge to try to give the impression that they have much knowledge. Such\npeople generally do TOO MUCH talking, and TOO LITTLE listening. Keep your\neyes and ears wide open— and your mouth CLOSED, if you wish to acquire the\nhabit of prompt DECISION. Those who talk too much do little else. If you talk\nmore than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of many opportunities to\naccumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose your PLANS and\nPURPOSES to people who will take great delight in defeating you, because they\nenvy you.\n\nRemember, also, that every time you open your mouth in the presence of a\nperson who has an abundance of knowledge, you display to that person, your\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n141\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Genuine wisdom is usually\nconspicuous through modesty and silence.\n\nKeep in mind the fact that every person with whom you associate is, like\nyourself, seeking the opportunity to accumulate money. If you talk about your\nplans too freely, you may be surprised when you learn that some other person\nhas beaten you to your goal by PUTTING INTO ACTION AHEAD OF YOU, the\nplans of which you talked unwisely.\n\nLet one of your first decisions be to KEEP A CLOSED MOUTH AND\nOPEN EARS AND EYES.\n\nAs a reminder to yourself to follow this advice, it will be helpful if you\ncopy the following epigram in large letters and place it where you will see it\ndaily.\n\n\"TELL THE WORLD WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO, BUT FIRST SHOW\nIT.\"\n\nThis is the equivalent of saying that \"deeds, and not words, are what count\nmost.\"\n\nFREEDOM OR DEATH ON A DECISION\n\nThe value of decisions depends upon the courage required to render them.\nThe great decisions, which served as the foundation of civilization, were reached\nby assuming great risks, which often meant the possibility of death.\n\nLincoln's decision to issue his famous Proclamation of Emancipation,\nwhich gave freedom to the colored people of America, was rendered with full\nunderstanding that his act would turn thousands of friends and political\nsupporters against him. He knew, too, that the carrying out of that proclamation\nwould mean death to thousands of men on the battlefield. In the end, it cost\nLincoln his life. That required courage.\n\nSocrates' decision to drink the cup of poison, rather than compromise in\nhis personal belief, was a decision of courage. It turned Time ahead a thousand\nyears, and gave to people then unborn, the right to freedom of thought and of\nspeech.\n\nThe decision of Gen. Robert E. Lee, when he came to the parting of the\nway with the Union, and took up the cause of the South, was a decision of\ncourage, for he well knew that it might cost him his own life, that it would surely\ncost the lives of others.\n\nBut, the greatest decision of all time, as far as any American citizen is\nconcerned, was reached in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776, when fifty-six men signed\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n142\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

He aimed, first, at the job of Assistant Sales Manager of his\ncompany, and got the job. That one step upward placed him high enough above\nthe crowd to enable him to see still greater opportunity, also, it placed him where\nOPPORTUNITY COULD SEE HIM.\n\nHe made such a fine record selling hearing aids, that A. M. Andrews,\nChairman of the Board of the Dictograph Products Company, a business\ncompetitor of the company for which Halpin worked, wanted to know\nsomething about that man Dan Halpin who was taking big sales away from the\nlong established Dictograph Company. He sent for Halpin. When the interview\nwas over, Halpin was the new Sales Manager, in charge of the Acousticon\nDivision. Then, to test young Halpin's metal, Mr. Andrews went away to Florida\nfor three months, leaving him to sink or swim in his new job. He did not sink!\nKnute Rockne's spirit of \"All the world loves a winner, and has no time for a\nloser inspired him to put so much into his job that he was recently elected VicePresident of the company, and General Manager of the Acousticon and Silent\nRadio Division, a job which most men would be proud to earn through ten years\nof loyal effort. Halpin turned the trick in little more than six months.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether Mr. Andrews or Mr. Halpin is more deserving\nof eulogy, for the reason that both showed evidence of having an abundance of\nthat very rare quality known as IMAGINATION. Mr. Andrews deserves credit\nfor seeing, in young Halpin, a \"go-getter\" of the highest order. Halpin deserves\ncredit for REFUSING TO COMPROMISE WITH LIFE BY ACCEPTING AND\nKEEPING A JOB HE DID NOT WANT, and that is one of the major points I am\ntrying to emphasize through this entire philosophy— that we rise to high\npositions or remain at the bottom BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS WE CAN\nCONTROL IF WE DESIRE TO CONTROL THEM.\n\nI am also trying to emphasize another point, namely, that both success and\nfailure are largely the results of HABIT! I have not the slightest doubt that Dan\nHalpin's close association with the greatest football coach America ever knew,\nplanted in his mind the same brand of DESIRE to excel which made the Notre\nDame football team world famous. Truly, there is something to the idea that\nhero-worship is helpful, provided one worships a WINNER. Halpin tells me that\nRockne was one of the world's greatest leaders of men in all history.\n\nMy belief in the theory that business associations are vital factors, both in\nfailure and in success, was recently demonstrated, when my son Blair was\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n83\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Mr. Halpin offered him a beginning\nsalary of about one half what he could have gotten from a rival company. I\nbrought parental pressure to bear, and induced him to accept the place with Mr.\nHalpin, because I BELIEVE THAT CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH ONE WHO\nREFUSES TO COMPROMISE WITH CIRCUMSTANCES HE DOES NOT LIKE,\nIS AN ASSET THAT CAN NEVER BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF MONEY.\n\nThe bottom is a monotonous, dreary, unprofitable place for any person.\nThat is why I have taken the time to describe how lowly beginnings may be\ncircumvented by proper planning. Also, that is why so much space has been\ndevoted to a description of this new profession, created by a woman who was\ninspired to do a fine job of PLANNING because she wanted her son to have a\nfavorable \"break.\"\n\nWith the changed conditions ushered in by the world economic collapse,\ncame also the need for newer and better ways of marketing PERSONAL\nSERVICES. It is hard to determine why someone had not previously discovered\nthis stupendous need, in view of the fact that more money changes hands in\nreturn for personal services than for any other purpose. The sum paid out\nmonthly, to people who work for wages and salaries, is so huge that it runs into\nhundreds of millions, and the annual distribution amounts to billions.\n\nPerhaps some will find, in the IDEA here briefly described, the nucleus of\nthe riches they DESIRE! Ideas with much less merit have been the seedlings from\nwhich great fortunes have grown. Woolworth's Five and Ten Cent Store idea, for\nexample, had far less merit, but it piled up a fortune for its creator.\n\nThose seeing OPPORTUNITY lurking in this suggestion will find valuable\naid in the chapter on Organized Planning. Incidentally, an efficient merchandiser\nof personal services would find a growing demand for his services wherever\nthere are men and women who seek better markets for their services. By\napplying the Master Mind principle, a few people with suitable talent, could\nform an alliance, and have a paying business very quickly. One would need to be\na fair writer, with a flair for advertising and selling, one handy at typing and\nhand lettering, and one should be a first class business getter who would let the\nworld know about the service. If one person possessed all these abilities, he\nmight carry on the business alone, until it outgrew him.\n\nThe woman who prepared the \"Personal Service Sales Plan\" for her son\nnow receives requests from all parts of the country for her cooperation in\npreparing similar plans for others who desire to market their personal services\nfor more money. She has a staff of expert typists, artists, and writers who have\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n84\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

She is so confident of her ability that she accepts, as the major portion of\nher fee, a percentage of the increased pay she helps her clients to earn.\n\nIt must not be supposed that her plan merely consists of clever\nsalesmanship by which she helps men and women to demand and receive more\nmoney for he same services they formerly sold for less pay. She looks after the\ninterests of the purchaser as well as the seller of personal services, and so\nprepares her plans that the employer receives full value for the additional money\nhe pays. The method by which she accomplishes this astonishing result is a\nprofessional secret which she discloses to no one excepting her own clients.\n\nIf you have the IMAGINATION, and seek a more profitable outlet for\nyour personal services, this suggestion may be the stimulus for which you have\nbeen searching. The IDEA is capable of yielding an income far greater than that\nof the \"average\" doctor, lawyer, or engineer whose education required several\nyears in college. The idea is saleable to those seeking new positions, in practically\nall positions calling for managerial or executive ability, and those desiring rearrangement of incomes in their present positions.",

This necessity may be\n_your OPPORTUNITY!_\n\nTHE 10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP\n\nWe come now to the major faults of leaders who fail, because it is just as\nessential to know WHAT NOT TO DO as it is to know what to do.\n\n1. INABILITY TO ORGANIZE DETAILS. Efficient\nleadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No\ngenuine leader is ever \"too busy\" to do anything which may be\nrequired of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he\nis a leader or follower, admits that he is \"too busy\" to change his\nplans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his\ninefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details\nconnected with his position. That means, of course, that he must\nacquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants.\n\n2. UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE.\nTruly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform\nany sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. \"The\ngreatest among ye shall be the servant of all\" is a truth which all\nable leaders observe and respect.\n\n3. EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY \"KNOW\"\nINSTEAD OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY\nKNOW. The world does not pay men for that which they \"know.\" It\npays them for what they DO, or induce others to do.\n\n4. FEAR OF COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERS. The\nleader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n106\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook? Discover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :  www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com |106|\n|---|---|---|\n\n-----\n\npractically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader\ntrains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the\ndetails of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply\nhimself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give\nattention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men\nreceive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO\nPERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An\nefficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the\nmagnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of\nothers, and induce them to render more service and better service\nthan they could render without his aid.\n\n5. LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the\nleader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans\nby which to guide his followers efficiently.\n\n6. SELFISHNESS. The leader who claims all the honor for the\nwork of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really\ngreat leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to\nsee the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he\nknows that most men will work harder for commendation and\nrecognition than they will for money alone.\n\n7. INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an\nintemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various\nforms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in\nit.\n\n8. DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this should have come at the head\nof the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his\nassociates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long\nmaintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the\ndust of the earth, and brings down on one's head the contempt he\ndeserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in\nevery walk of life.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n107\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

EMPHASIS OF THE \"AUTHORITY\" OF LEADERSHIP.\nThe efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instil\nfear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress\nhis followers with his \"authority\" comes within the category of\nleadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, he will\nhave no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct— his\nsympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he\nknows his job.\n\n10. EMPHASIS OF TITLE. The competent leader requires no\n\"title\" to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes\ntoo much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The\ndoors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to\nenter, and his working quarters are free from formality or\nostentation.\n\nThese are among the more common of the causes of failure in leadership.\nAny one of these faults is sufficient to induce failure. Study the list carefully if\nyou aspire to leadership, and make sure that you are free of these faults.\n\nSOME FERTILE FIELDS IN WHICH \"NEW LEADERSHIP\" WILL\n\nBE REQUIRED\n\nBefore leaving this chapter, your attention is called to a few of the fertile\nfields in which there has been a decline of leadership, and in which the new type\nof leader may find an abundance of OPPORTUNITY.\n\nFirst. In the field of politics there is a most insistent demand\nfor new leaders; a demand which indicates nothing less than an\nemergency. The majority of politicians have, seemingly, become\nhigh-grade, legalized racketeers. They have increased taxes and\ndebauched the machinery of industry and business until the people\ncan no longer stand the burden.\n\nSecond. The banking business is undergoing a reform. The\nleaders in this field have almost entirely lost the confidence of the\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n108\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Already the bankers have sensed the need of reform, and\nthey have begun it.\n\nThird. Industry calls for new leaders. The old type of leaders\nthought and moved in terms of dividends instead of thinking and\nmoving in terms of human equations! The future leader in industry,\nto endure, must regard himself as a quasi-public official whose\nduty it is to manage his trust in such a way that it will work\nhardship on no individual, or group of individuals. Exploitation of\nworking men is a thing of the past. Let the man who aspires to\nleadership in the field of business, industry, and labor remember\nthis.\n\nFourth.

In the professions of law, medicine, and education, a\nnew brand of leadership, and to some extent, new leaders will\nbecome a necessity.

Knowledge has no value except that\nwhich can be gained from its application toward some worthy end. This is one\nreason why college degrees are not valued more highly. They represent nothing\nbut miscellaneous knowledge.\n\nIf you contemplate taking additional schooling, first determine the\npurpose for which you want the knowledge you are seeking, then learn where\nthis particular sort of knowledge can be obtained, from reliable sources.\n\nSuccessful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized\nknowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession. Those who are\nnot successful usually make the mistake of believing that the knowledge\nacquiring period ends when one finishes school. The truth is that schooling does\nbut little more than to put one in the way of learning how to acquire practical\nknowledge.\n\nWith this Changed World which began at the end of the economic\ncollapse, came also astounding changes in educational requirements. The order\nof the day is SPECIALIZATION! This truth was emphasized by Robert P. Moore,\nsecretary of appointments of Columbia University.\n\n\"SPECIALISTS MOST SOUGHT\n\n\"Particularly sought after by employing companies are candidates who\nhave specialized in some field— business-school graduates with training in\naccounting and statistics, engineers of all varieties, journalists, architects,\nchemists, and also outstanding leaders and activity men of the senior class.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n76\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

For this reason we emphasize qualities of\ncharacter, intelligence and personality far more than specific educational\nbackground.'\n\n\"APPRENTICESHIP' PROPOSED\n\n\"Proposing a system of 'apprenticing' students in offices, stores and\nindustrial occupations during the summer vacation, Mr. Moore asserts that after\nthe first two or three years of college, every student should be asked 'to choose a\ndefinite future course and to call a halt if he has been merely pleasantly drifting\nwithout purpose through an unspecialized academic curriculum.'\n\n\"Colleges and universities must face the practical consideration that all\nprofessions and occupations now demand specialists,\" he said, urging that\neducational institutions accept more direct responsibility for vocational\nguidance. One of the most reliable and practical sources of knowledge available\nto those who need specialized schooling, is the night schools operated in most\nlarge cities. The correspondence schools give specialized training anywhere the\nU. S. mails go, on all subjects that can be taught by the extension method. One\nadvantage of home study training is the flexibility of the study programme\nwhich permits one to study during spare time. Another stupendous advantage of\nhome study training (if the school is carefully chosen), is the fact that most\ncourses offered by home study schools carry with them generous privileges of\nconsultation which can be of priceless value to those needing specialized\nknowledge. No matter where you live, you can share the benefits.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n77\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The SELF-DISCIPLINE one receives\nfrom a definite programme of specialized study makes up to some extent, for the\nwasted opportunity when knowledge was available without cost.\nCorrespondence schools are highly organized business institutions. Their tuition\nfees are so low that they are forced to insist upon prompt payments. Being asked\nto pay, whether the student makes good grades or poor, has the effect of causing\none to follow through with the course when he would otherwise drop it. The\ncorrespondence schools have not stressed this point sufficiently, for the truth is\nthat their collection departments constitute the very finest sort of training on\nDECISION, PROMPTNESS, ACTION and THE HABIT OF FINISHING THAT\nWHICH ONE BEGINS.\n\nI learned this from experience, more than twenty-five years ago. I enrolled\nfor a home study course in Advertising. After completing eight or ten lessons I\nstopped studying, but the school did not stop sending me bills. Moreover, it\ninsisted upon payment, whether I kept up my studies or not. I decided that if I\nhad to pay for the course (which I had legally obligated myself to do), I should\ncomplete the lessons and get my money's worth. I felt, at the time, that the\ncollection system of the school was somewhat too well organized, but I learned\nlater in life that it was a valuable part of my training for which no charge had\nbeen made. Being forced to pay, I went ahead and completed the course. Later in\nlife I discovered that the efficient collection system of that school had been worth\nmuch in the form of money earned, because of the training in advertising I had\nso reluctantly taken.",

Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire,\nand begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan\ninto action.\n\nFifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of\nmoney you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its\nacquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money,\nand describe clearly the plan through which you intend to\naccumulate it.\n\nSixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once\njust before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning.\nAS YOU READ— SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF\nALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.\n\nIt is important that you follow the instructions described in these six steps.\nIt is especially important that you observe, and follow the instructions in the\nsixth paragraph. You may complain that it is impossible for you to \"see yourself\nin possession of money\" before you actually have it. Here is where a BURNING\nDESIRE will come to your aid. If you truly DESIRE money so keenly that your\ndesire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you\nwill acquire it. The object is to want money, and to become so determined to\nhave it that you CONVINCE yourself you will have it.\n\nOnly those who become \"money conscious\" ever accumulate great riches.\n\"Money consciousness\" means that the mind has become so thoroughly saturated\nwith the DESIRE for money, that one can see one's self already in possession of it.\n\nTo the uninitiated, who has not been schooled in the working principles of\nthe human mind, these instructions may appear impractical. It may be helpful, to\nall who fail to recognize the soundness of the six steps, to know that the\ninformation they convey, was received from Andrew Carnegie, who began as an\nordinary laborer in the steel mills, but managed, despite his humble beginning,\nto make these principles yield him a fortune of considerably more than one\nhundred million dollars.\n\nIt may be of further help to know that the six steps here recommended\nwere carefully scrutinized by the late Thomas A.

They do not\nrequire one to become ridiculous, or credulous. To apply them calls for no great\namount of education. But the successful application of these six steps does call\nfor sufficient imagination to enable one to see, and to understand, that\naccumulation of money cannot be left to chance, good fortune, and luck. One\nmust realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes, first did a certain\namount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, DESIRING, and PLANNING before they\nacquired money.\n\nYou may as well know, right here, that you can never have riches in great\nquantities, UNLESS you can work yourself into a white heat of DESIRE for\nmoney, and actually BELIEVE you will possess it.\n\nYou may as well know, also that every great leader, from the dawn of\ncivilization down to the present, was a dreamer. Christianity is the greatest\npotential power in the world today, because its founder was an intense dreamer\nwho had the vision and the imagination to see realities in their mental and\nspiritual form before they had been transmuted into physical form.\n\nIf you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them\nin your bank balance.\n\nNever, in the history of America has there been so great an opportunity\nfor practical dreamers as now exists. The six year economic collapse has reduced\nall men, substantially, to the same level. A new race is about to be run. The stakes\nrepresent huge fortunes which will be accumulated within the next ten years.\nThe rules of the race have changed, because we now live in a CHANGED\nWORLD that definitely favors the masses, those who had but little or no\nopportunity to win under the conditions existing during the depression, when\nfear paralyzed growth and development.\n\nWe who are in this race for riches, should be encouraged to know that this\nchanged world in which we live is demanding new ideas, new ways of doing\nthings, new leaders, new inventions, new methods of teaching, new methods of\nmarketing, new books, new literature, new features for the radio, new ideas for\nmoving pictures. Back of all this demand for new and better things, there is one\nquality which one must possess to win, and that is DEFINITENESS OF\nPURPOSE, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning DESIRE to possess\nit.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n33\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

This changed world requires practical dreamers who can, and will put\ntheir dreams into action. The practical dreamers have always been, and always\nwill be the pattern-makers of civilization.\n\nWe who desire to accumulate riches, should remember the real leaders of\nthe world always have been men who harnessed, and put into practical use, the\nintangible, unseen forces of unborn opportunity, and have converted those\nforces, [or impulses of thought], into sky-scrapers, cities, factories, airplanes,\nautomobiles, and every form of convenience that makes life more pleasant.\n\nTolerance, and an open mind are practical necessities of the dreamer of\ntoday. Those who are afraid of new ideas are doomed before they start. Never\nhas there been a time more favorable to pioneers than the present. True, there is\nno wild and woolly west to be conquered, as in the days of the Covered Wagon;\nbut there is a vast business, financial, and industrial world to be remoulded and\nredirected along new and better lines.\n\nIn planning to acquire your share of the riches, let no one influence you to\nscorn the dreamer. To win the big stakes in this changed world, you must catch\nthe spirit of the great pioneers of the past, whose dreams have given to\ncivilization all that it has of value, the spirit which serves as the life-blood of our\nown country— your opportunity and mine, to develop and market our talents.\n\nLet us not forget, Columbus dreamed of an Unknown world, staked his\nlife on the existence of such a world, and discovered it!\n\nCopernicus, the great astronomer, dreamed of a multiplicity of worlds,\nand revealed them! No one denounced him as \"impractical\" after he had\ntriumphed. Instead, the world worshipped at his shrine, thus proving once more\nthat \"SUCCESS REQUIRES NO APOLOGIES, FAILURE PERMITS NO ALIBIS.\"\n\nIf the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it!\nPut your dream across, and never mind what \"they\" say if you meet with\ntemporary defeat, for \"they,\" perhaps, do not know that EVERY FAILURE\nBRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT SUCCESS.\n\nHenry Ford, poor and uneducated, dreamed of a horseless carriage, went\nto work with what tools he possessed, without waiting for opportunity to favor\nhim, and now evidence of his dream belts the entire earth. He has put more\nwheels into operation than any man who ever lived, because he was not afraid to\nback his dreams.\n\nThomas Edison dreamed of a lamp that could be operated by electricity,\nbegan where he stood to put his dream into action, and despite more than ten",

This is an astounding statement,\nand all the more so, when we take into consideration the popular belief, that\nriches come only to those who work hard and long.\n\nWhen you begin to THINK AND GROW RICH, you will observe that\nriches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no\nhard work. You, and every other person, ought to be interested in knowing how\nto acquire that state of mind which will attract riches. I spent twenty-five years in\nresearch, analyzing more than 25,000 people, because I, too, wanted to know\n\"how wealthy men become that way.\n\nWithout that research, this book could not have been written.\nHere take notice of a very significant truth, viz:\nThe business depression started in 1929, and continued on to an all time\nrecord of destruction, until sometime after President Roosevelt entered office.\nThen the depression began to fade into nothingness. Just as an electrician in a\ntheatre raises the lights so gradually that darkness is transmuted into light before\nyou realize it, so did the spell of fear in the minds of the people gradually fade\naway and become faith.\n\nObserve very closely, as soon as you master the principles of this\nphilosophy, and begin to follow the instructions for applying those principles,\nyour financial status will begin to improve, and everything you touch will begin\nto transmute itself into an asset for your benefit. Impossible? Not at all!\n\nOne of the main weaknesses of mankind is the average man's familiarity\nwith the word \"impossible.\" He knows all the rules which will NOT work. He\nknows all the things which CANNOT be done.

The first thing I did\nwith it was to turn to the word \"impossible,\" and neatly clip it out of the book.\nThat would not be an unwise thing for you to do.\n\nSuccess comes to those who become SUCCESS CONSCIOUS.\nFailure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become\nFAILURE CONSCIOUS.\n\nThe object of this book is to help all who seek it, to learn the art of\nchanging their minds from FAILURE CONSCIOUSNESS to SUCCESS\nCONSCIOUSNESS.\n\nAnother weakness found in altogether too many people, is the habit of\nmeasuring everything, and everyone, by their own impressions and beliefs. Some\nwho will read this, will believe that no one can THINK AND GROW RICH. They\ncannot think in terms of riches, because their thought habits have been steeped in\npoverty, want, misery, failure, and defeat.\n\nThese unfortunate people remind me of a prominent Chinese, who came\nto America to be educated in American ways. He attended the University of\nChicago.

Sure, the\nother fellow's eyes are \"off slant,\" BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AS\nOUR OWN.\n\nMillions of people look at the achievements of Henry Ford, after he has\narrived, and envy him, because of his good fortune, or luck, or genius, or\nwhatever it is that they credit for Ford's fortune. Perhaps one person in every\nhundred thousand knows the secret of Ford's success, and those who do know\nare too modest, or too reluctant, to speak of it, because of its simplicity. A single\ntransaction will illustrate the \"secret\" perfectly.\n\nA few years back, Ford decided to produce his now famous V-8 motor. He\nchose to build an engine with the entire eight cylinders cast in one block, and\ninstructed his engineers to produce a design for the engine. The design was\nplaced on paper, but the engineers agreed, to a man, that it was simply impossible\nto cast an eight-cylinder gas engine block in one piece.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n24\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

There was nothing else for them to do, if they\nwere to remain on the Ford staff. Six months went by, nothing happened.\nAnother six months passed, and still nothing happened. The engineers tried\nevery conceivable plan to carry out the orders, but the thing seemed out of the\nquestion; \"impossible!\"\n\nAt the end of the year Ford checked with his engineers, and again they\ninformed him they had found no way to carry out his orders.\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" said Ford, \"I want it, and I'll have it.\"\nThey went ahead, and then, as if by a stroke of magic, the secret was\ndiscovered.\n\nThe Ford DETERMINATION had won once more!\nThis story may not be described with minute accuracy, but the sum and\nsubstance of it is correct. Deduce from it, you who wish to THINK AND GROW\nRICH, the secret of the Ford millions, if you can. You'll not have to look very far.\n\nHenry Ford is a success, because he understands, and applies the principles\nof success. One of these is DESIRE: knowing what one wants. Remember this\nFord story as you read, and pick out the lines in which the secret of his\nstupendous achievement have been described. If you can do this, if you can lay\nyour finger on the particular group of principles which made Henry Ford rich,\nyou can equal his achievements in almost any calling for which you are suited.\n\nYOU ARE \"THE MASTER OF YOUR FATE, THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR\n\nSOUL,\" BECAUSE…\n\nWhen Henley wrote the prophetic lines, \"I am the Master of my Fate, I am\nthe Captain of my Soul,\" he should have informed us that we are the Masters of\nour Fate, the Captains of our Souls, because we have the power to control our\nthoughts.\n\nHe should have told us that the ether in which this little earth floats, in\nwhich we move and have our being, is a form of energy moving at an\ninconceivably high rate of vibration, and that the ether is filled with a form of\nuniversal power which ADAPTS itself to the nature of the thoughts we hold in\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n25\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Last year the owner of that business\npaid an income tax of almost ten times as much as was paid by the merchant for\nwhom he worked when the depression forced upon him a temporary adversity\nwhich proved to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nThe beginning of this successful business was an IDEA!\nInasmuch as I had the privilege of supplying the unemployed salesman\nwith that idea, I now assume the further privilege of suggesting another idea\nwhich has within it the possibility of even greater income. Also the possibility of\nrendering useful service to thousands of people who badly need that service.\n\nThe idea was suggested by the salesman who gave up selling and went\ninto the business of keeping books on a wholesale basis. When the plan was\nsuggested as a solution of his unemployment problem, he quickly exclaimed, \"I\nlike the idea, but I would not know how to turn it into cash.\" In other words, he\ncomplained he would not know how to market his bookkeeping knowledge after\nhe acquired it.\n\nSo, that brought up another problem which had to be solved. With the aid\nof a young woman typist, clever at hand lettering, and who could put the story\ntogether, a very attractive book was prepared, describing the advantages of the\nnew system of book-keeping. The pages were neatly typed and pasted in an\nordinary scrapbook, which was used as a silent salesman with which the story of\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n80\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The aggregate annual income from such a service\nmight easily exceed that received by the largest employment agency, and the\nbenefits of the service might be made far greater to the purchaser than any to be\nobtained from an employment agency.\n\nThe IDEA here described was born of necessity, to bridge an emergency\nwhich had to be covered, but it did not stop by merely serving one person. The\nwoman who created the idea has a keen IMAGINATION. She saw in her newly\nborn brain-child the making of a new profession, one that is destined to render\nvaluable service to thousands of people who need practical guidance in\nmarketing personal services.\n\nSpurred to action by the instantaneous success of her first \"PREPARED\nPLAN TO MARKET PERSONAL SERVICES,\" this energetic woman turned next\nto the solution of a similar problem for her son who had just finished college, but\nhad been totally unable to find a market for his services. The plan she originated\nfor his use was the finest specimen of merchandising of personal services I have\never seen.\n\nWhen the plan book had been completed, it contained nearly fifty pages of\nbeautifully typed, properly organized information, telling the story of her son's\nnative ability, schooling, personal experiences, and a great variety of other\ninformation too extensive for description. The plan book also contained a\ncomplete description of the position her son desired, together with a marvelous\nword picture of the exact plan he would use in filling the position.\n\nThe preparation of the plan book required several week's labor, during\nwhich time its creator sent her son to the public library almost daily, to procure\ndata needed in selling his services to best advantage. She sent him, also to all the\ncompetitors of his prospective employer, and gathered from them vital\ninformation concerning their business methods which was of great value in the\nformation of the plan he intended to use in filling the position he sought. When\nthe plan had been finished, it contained more than half a dozen very fine\nsuggestions for the use and benefit of the prospective employer. (The suggestions\nwere put into use by the company).\n\nOne may be inclined to ask, \"Why go to all this trouble to secure a job?\"\nThe answer is straight to the point, also it is dramatic, because it deals with a\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n81\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

THE\nPLAN PREPARED BY THIS WOMAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER SON,\nHELPED HIM GET THE JOB FOR WHICH HE APPLIED, AT THE FIRST\nINTERVIEW, AT A SALARY FIXED BY HIMSELF.\"\n\nMoreover— and this, too, is important— THE POSITION DID NOT\nREQUIRE THE YOUNG MAN TO START AT THE BOTTOM. HE BEGAN AS A\nJUNIOR EXECUTIVE, AT AN EXECUTIVE'S SALARY.\n\n\"Why go to all this trouble?\" do you ask?\nWell, for one thing, the PLANNED PRESENTATION of this young man's\napplication for a position clipped off no less than ten years of time he would\nhave required to get to where he began, had he \"started at the bottom and\nworked his way up.\"\n\nThis idea of starting at the bottom and working one's way up may appear\nto be sound, but the major objection to it is this— too many of those who begin at\nthe bottom never manage to lift their heads high enough to be seen by\nOPPORTUNITY, so they remain at the bottom. It should be remembered, also,\nthat the outlook from the bottom is not so very bright or encouraging. It has a\ntendency to kill off ambition. We call it \"getting into a rut,\" which means that we\naccept our fate because we form the HABIT of daily routine, a habit that finally\nbecomes so strong we cease to try to throw it off. And that is another reason why\nit pays to start one or two steps above the bottom. By so doing one forms the\nHABIT of looking around, of observing how others get ahead, of seeing\nOPPORTUNITY, and of embracing it without hesitation.\n\nDan Halpin is a splendid example of what I mean. During his college\ndays, he was manager of the famous 1930 National Championship Notre Dame\nfootball team, when it was under the direction of the late Knute Rockne.\n\nPerhaps he was inspired by the great football coach to aim high, and NOT\nMISTAKE TEMPORARY DEFEAT FOR FAILURE, just as Andrew Carnegie, the\ngreat industrial leader, inspired his young business lieutenants to set high goals\nfor themselves. At any rate, young Halpin finished college at a mighty\nunfavorable time, when the depression had made jobs scarce, so, after a fling at\ninvestment banking and motion pictures, he took the first opening with a\npotential future he could find— selling electrical hearing aids on a commission\nbasis. ANYONE COULD START IN THAT SORT OF JOB, AND HALPIN KNEW\nIT, but it was enough to open the door of opportunity to him.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n82\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

The \"jack-ofall-trades\" seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on\none DEFINITE CHIEF AIM.\n\n21. THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING. The\nspend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in\nFEAR OF POVERTY. Form the habit of systematic saving by\nputting aside a definite percentage of your income. Money in the\nbank gives one a very safe foundation of COURAGE when bargaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must\ntake what one is offered, and be glad to get it.\n\n22. LACK OF ENTHUSIASM. Without enthusiasm one\ncannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the\nperson who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any\ngroup of people.\n\n23. INTOLERANCE. The person with a \"closed\" mmd on\nany subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has\nstopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of\nintolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political\ndifferences of opinion.\n\n24. INTEMPERANCE. The most damaging forms of\nintemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual\nactivities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success.\n\n25. INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS. More\npeople lose their positions and their big opportunities in life,\nbecause of this fault, than for all other reasons combined.

QUICK RICHES are more dangerous than poverty.\n\n27. INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY. There is no substitute for\nhonesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of\ncircumstances over which one has no control, without permanent\ndamage. But, there is NO HOPE for the person who is dishonest by\nchoice.

This is a common cause of failure\namong those who start out in business for the first time, without\nsufficient reserve of capital to absorb the shock of their mistakes,\nand to carry them over until they have established a\nREPUTATION.\n\n31.

It will be\nhelpful if you can induce someone who knows you well to go over this list with\nyou, and help to analyze you by the thirty causes of failure. It may be beneficial if\nyou try this alone. Most people cannot see themselves as others see them. You\nmay be one who cannot.\n\nThe oldest of admonitions is \"Man, know thyself!\" If you market\nmerchandise successfully, you must know the merchandise. The same is true in\nmarketing personal services. You should know all of your weaknesses in order\nthat you may either bridge them or eliminate them entirely. You should know\nyour strength in order that you may call attention to it when selling your\nservices. You can know yourself only through accurate analysis.\n\nThe folly of ignorance in connection with self was displayed by a young\nman who applied to the manager of a well known business for a position. He\nmade a very good impression until the manager asked him what salary he\nexpected. He replied that he had no fixed sum in mind (lack of a definite aim). The\nmanager then said, \"We will pay you all you are worth, alter we try you out for a\nweek.\"\n\n\"I will not accept it,\" the applicant replied, \"because I AM GETTING\nMORE THAN THAT WHERE I AM NOW EMPLOYED.\"\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n125\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

One's object should be, of\ncourse, to go ahead. Annual self-analysis will disclose whether advancement has\nbeen, made, and if so, how much. It will also disclose any backward steps one\nmay have made. The effective marketing of personal services requires one to\nmove forward even if the progress is slow.\n\nYour annual self-analysis should be made at the end of each year, so you\ncan include in your New Year's Resolutions any improvements which the\nanalysis indicates should be made.

General knowledge, no matter how great in quantity or variety it\nmay be, is of but little use in the accumulation of money. The faculties of the\ngreat universities possess, in the aggregate, practically every form of general\nknowledge known to civilization. Most of the professors have but little or no money.\nThey specialize on teaching knowledge, but they do not specialize on the\norganization, or the use of knowledge.\n\nKNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and\nintelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE\nEND of accumulation of money. Lack of understanding of this fact has been the\nsource of confusion to millions of people who falsely believe that \"knowledge is\npower.\" It is nothing of the sort! Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes\npower only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and\ndirected to a definite end.\n\nThis \"missing link\" in all systems of education known to civilization today,\nmay be found in the failure of educational institutions to teach their students\nHOW TO ORGANIZE AND USE KNOWLEDGE AFTER THEY ACQUIRE IT.\n\nMany people make the mistake of assuming that, because Henry Ford had\nbut little \"schooling,\" he is not a man of \"education.\" Those who make this\nmistake do not know Henry Ford, nor do they understand the real meaning of\nthe word \"educate.\" That word is derived from the Latin word \"educo,\" meaning\nto educe, to draw out, to DEVELOP FROM WITHIN.\n\nAn educated man is not, necessarily, one who has an abundance of\ngeneral or specialized knowledge. An educated man is one who has so\ndeveloped the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its\nequivalent, without violating the rights of others. Henry Ford comes well within\nthe meaning of this definition.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n73\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

When the suit was tried in the Courts, the attorneys for the paper\npleaded justification, and placed Mr. Ford, himself, on the witness stand, for the\npurpose of proving to the jury that he was ignorant. The attorneys asked Mr.\nFord a great variety of questions, all of them intended to prove, by his own\nevidence, that, while he might possess considerable specialized knowledge\npertaining to the manufacture of automobiles, he was, in the main, ignorant.\n\nMr. Ford was plied with such questions as the following: \"Who was\nBenedict Arnold?\" and \"How many soldiers did the British send over to America\nto put down the Rebellion of 1776?\" In answer to the last question, Mr. Ford\nreplied, \"I do not know the exact number of soldiers the British sent over, but I\nhave heard that it was a considerably larger number than ever went back.\"\n\nFinally, Mr. Ford became tired of this line of questioning, and in reply to a\nparticularly offensive question, he leaned over, pointed his finger at the lawyer\nwho had asked the question, and said, \"If I should really WANT to answer the\nfoolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been\nasking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric push-buttons on my\ndesk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can\nanswer ANY question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am\ndevoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, WHY I should clutter\nup my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer\nquestions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I\nrequire?\"\n\nThere certainly was good logic to that reply.\nThat answer floored the lawyer. Every person in the courtroom realized it\nwas the answer, not of an ignorant man, but of a man of EDUCATION. Any man\nis educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs it, and how to\norganize that knowledge into definite plans of action. Through the assistance of\nhis \"Master Mind\" group, Henry Ford had at his command all the specialized\nknowledge he needed to enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in\nAmerica. It was not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind. Surely no\nperson who has sufficient inclination and intelligence to read a book of this\nnature can possibly miss the significance of this illustration.\n\nBefore you can be sure of your ability to transmute DESIRE into its\nmonetary equivalent, you will require SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n74\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Perhaps you may need much more specialized knowledge than you\nhave the ability or the inclination to acquire, and if this should be true, you may\nbridge your weakness through the aid of your \"Master Mind\" group.\n\nAndrew Carnegie stated that he, personally, knew nothing about the\ntechnical end of the steel business; moreover, he did not particularly care to\nknow anything about it. The specialized knowledge which he required for the\nmanufacture and marketing of steel, he found available through the individual\nunits of his MASTER MIND GROUP.\n\nThe accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is\nacquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized\nknowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the\npossession of the man who accumulates the fortune.\n\nThe preceding paragraph should give hope and encouragement to the\nman with ambition to accumulate a fortune, who has not possessed himself of\nthe necessary \"education\" to supply such specialized knowledge as he may\nrequire. Men sometimes go through life suffering from \"inferiority complexes,\"\nbecause they are not men of \"education.\" The man who can organize and direct a\n\"Master Mind\" group of men who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation\nof money, is just as much a man of education as any man in the group.\nREMEMBER THIS, if you suffer from a feeling of inferiority, because your\nschooling has been limited.\n\nThomas A. Edison had only three months of \"schooling\" during his entire\nlife. He did not lack education, neither did he die poor.\n\nHenry Ford had less than a sixth grade \"schooling\" but he has managed to\ndo pretty well by himself, financially.\n\nSPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE is among the most plentiful, and the\ncheapest forms of service which may be had! If you doubt this, consult the\npayroll of any university.\n\nIT PAYS TO KNOW HOW TO PURCHASE KNOWLEDGE\n\nFirst of all, decide the sort of specialized knowledge you require, and the\npurpose for which it is needed. To a large extent your major purpose in life, the\ngoal toward which you are working, will help determine what knowledge you\nneed.

If there is a principle of cause and effect, which controls_\nbusiness, finance, and transportation, this same principle controls individuals\nand determines their economic status.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR \"QQS\" RATING?\n\nThe causes of success in marketing services EFFECTIVELY and\npermanently, have been clearly described. Unless those causes are studied,\nanalyzed, understood and APPLIED, no man can market his services effectively\nand permanently. Every person must be his own salesman of personal services.\nThe QUALITY and the QUANTITY of service rendered, and the SPIRIT in which\nit is rendered, determine to a large extent, the price, and the duration of\nemployment. To market Personal services effectively, (which means a permanent\nmarket, at a satisfactory price, under pleasant conditions), one must adopt and\nfollow the \"QQS\" formula which means that QUALITY, plus QUANTITY, plus\nthe proper SPIRIT of cooperation, equals perfect salesmanship of service.\nRemember the \"QQS\" formula, but do more—APPLY IT AS A HABIT!\n\nLet us analyze the formula to make sure we understand exactly what it\nmeans.\n\n1. QUALITY of service shall be construed to mean the performance of\nevery detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner\npossible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind.\n\n2. QUANTITY of service shall be understood to mean the HABIT of\nrendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose\nof increasing the amount of service rendered as greater skill is developed\nthrough practice and experience. Emphasis is again placed on the word HABIT.\n\n3. SPIRIT of service shall be construed to mean the HABIT of agreeable,\narmonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow\nemployees.\n\nAdequacy of QUALITY and QUANTITY of service is not sufficient to\nmaintain a permanent market for your services. The conduct, or the SPIRIT in\nwhich you deliver service, is a strong determining factor in connection with both\nthe price you receive, and the duration of employment.\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n118\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

He emphasized again, and again, the necessity for HARMONIOUS\nCONDUCT. He stressed the fact that he would not retain any man, no matter\nhow great a QUANTITY, or how efficient the QUALITY of his work, unless he\nworked in a spirit of HARMONY. Mr. Carnegie insisted upon men being\nAGREEABLE.\n\nTo prove that he placed a high value upon this quality, he permitted many\nmen who conformed to his standards to become very wealthy. Those who did not\nconform, had to make room for others.\n\nThe importance of a pleasing personality has been stressed, because it is a\nfactor which enables one to render service in the proper SPIRIT. If one has a\npersonality which PLEASES, and renders service in a spirit of HARMONY, these\nassets often make up for deficiencies in both the QUALITY, and the QUANTITY\nof service one renders. Nothing, however, can be SUCCESSFULLY\nSUBSTITUTED FOR PLEASING CONDUCT.\n\nTHE CAPITAL VALUE OF YOUR SERVICES\n\nThe person whose income is derived entirely from the sale of personal\nservices is no less a merchant than the man who sells commodities, and it might\nwell be added, such a person is subject to EXACTLY THE SAME RULES of\nconduct as the merchant who sells merchandise.\n\nThis has been emphasized, because the majority of people who live by the\nsale of personal services make the mistake of considering themselves free from\nthe rules of conduct, and the responsibilities attached to those who are engaged\nin marketing commodities.\n\nThe new way of marketing services has practically forced both employer\nand. employee into partnership alliances, through which both take into\nconsideration the rights of the third party, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE.\n\nThe day of the \"go-getter\" has passed. He has been supplanted by the \"gogiver.\" High-pressure methods in business finally blew the lid off. There will\nnever be the need to put the lid back on, because, in the future, business will be\nconducted by methods that will require no pressure.\n\nThe actual capital value of your brains may be determined by the amount\nof income you can produce (by marketing your services). A fair estimate of the\ncapital value of your services may be made by multiplying your annual income\n\nDo You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?\nDiscover How To Begin Moving Forward with FREE Audio & Video Training at :\n\n119\n\n|Col1|Do You Feel Frustrated, Stuck Or Overwhelmed by the Concepts in this eBook?

Money rents for 6% per annum.\nMoney is worth no more than brains. It is often worth much less.\n\nCompetent \"brains,\" if effectively marketed, represent a much more\ndesirable form of capital than that which is required to conduct a business\ndealing in commodities, because \"brains\" are a form of capital which cannot be\npermanently depreciated through depressions, nor can this form of capital be\nstolen or spent. Moreover, the money which is essential for the conduct of\nbusiness is as worthless as a sand dune, until it has been mixed with efficient\n\"brains.\"\n\nTHE THIRTY MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE\nHOW MANY OF THESE ARE HOLDING YOU BACK?\n\nLife's greatest tragedy consists of men and women who earnestly try, and\nfail! The tragedy lies in the overwhelmingly large majority of people who fail, as\ncompared to the few who succeed.\n\nI have had the privilege of analyzing several thousand men and women,\n98% of whom were classed as \"failures.\" There is something radically wrong with\na civilization, and a system of education, which permit 98% of the people to go\nthrough life as failures. But I did not write this book for the purpose of\nmoralizing on the rights and wrongs of the world; that would require a book a\nhundred times the size of this one.\n\nMy analysis work proved that there are thirty major reasons for failure,\nand thirteen major principles through which people accumulate fortunes. In this\nchapter, a description of the thirty major causes of failure will be given. As you\ngo over the list, check yourself by it, point by point, for the purpose of\ndiscovering how many of these causes-of-failure stand between you and success.\n\n1. UNFAVORABLE HEREDITARY BACKGROUND. There\nis but little, if anything, which can be done for people who are born\nwith a deficiency in brain power. This philosophy offers but one\nmethod of bridging this weakness— through the aid of the Master\nMind. Observe with profit, however, that this is the ONLY one of\nthe thirty causes of failure which may not be easily corrected by any\nindividual.",

She looks after the\ninterests of the purchaser as well as the seller of personal services, and so\nprepares her plans that the employer receives full value for the additional money\nhe pays. The method by which she accomplishes this astonishing result is a\nprofessional secret which she discloses to no one excepting her own clients.\n\nIf you have the IMAGINATION, and seek a more profitable outlet for\nyour personal services, this suggestion may be the stimulus for which you have\nbeen searching. The IDEA is capable of yielding an income far greater than that\nof the \"average\" doctor, lawyer, or engineer whose education required several\nyears in college. The idea is saleable to those seeking new positions, in practically\nall positions calling for managerial or executive ability, and those desiring rearrangement of incomes in their present positions.\n\nThere is no fixed price for sound IDEAS!\nBack of all IDEAS is specialized knowledge. Unfortunately, for those who\ndo not find riches in abundance, specialized knowledge is more abundant and\nmore easily acquired than IDEAS. Because of this very truth, there is a universal\ndemand and an ever-increasing opportunity for the person capable of helping\nmen and women to sell their personal services advantageously. Capability means\nIMAGINATION, the one quality needed to combine specialized knowledge with\nIDEAS, in the form of ORGANIZED PLANS designed to yield riches.\n\nIf you have IMAGINATION this chapter may present you with an idea\nsufficient to serve as the beginning of the riches you desire. Remember, the IDEA\nis the main thing.

  "response": "### Chapter 7: ORGANIZED PLANNING\n\n**Summary**: This chapter focuses on the crystallization of desire into action through organized planning. It emphasizes the importance of having a definite plan to achieve one's goals and provides guidance on how to create and implement these plans effectively.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- **Importance of Planning**: The chapter underscores that successful achievement begins with a well-defined plan. Without a plan, desires remain abstract and unfulfilled.\n- **Steps for Effective Planning**:\n  - **Formulate a Clear Plan**: Create a detailed plan that outlines the steps needed to achieve your goals.\n  - **Master Mind Group**: Collaborate with a group of like-minded individuals who can provide support, feedback, and additional knowledge.\n  - **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adapt and modify your plans as necessary based on feedback and changing circumstances.\n  - **Implementation**: Take immediate action on your plans, regardless of whether you feel fully prepared. Action is crucial for progress.\n\n**Additional Insights**:\n- The chapter emphasizes that many people fail not because of a lack of desire but due to a lack of organized and actionable plans.\n- It encourages readers to persistently refine their plans and to view setbacks as opportunities to reassess and improve their strategies.\n\nThis chapter is essential for understanding how to translate desires into tangible outcomes through structured and strategic planning.",
