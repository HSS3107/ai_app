I was\nmanager at the time for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace out in Palestine;\nand shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the world by flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such\nfeat had ever been attempted before. It created a tremendous sensation. The Australian government awarded him\nfifty thousand dollars; the King of England knighted him; and, for a while, he was the most talked-about man\nunder the Union Jack. I was attending a banquet one night given in Sir Ross’s honor; and during the dinner, the\nman sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation “There’s a divinity that shapes our\nends, rough-hew them how we will.”\n\nThe raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He was wrong. I knew that, I knew it\npositively. There couldn’t be the slightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and display my\nsuperiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee of one to correct him. He stuck to\nhis guns. What? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it.",

Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging_\nwives ought to realize that people don’t want to change their minds. They can’t be forced or driven to agree\n_with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly._\n\nLincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his words: “It is an old and true maxim\nthat ‘a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall’. So with men, if you would win a man to your\ncause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which,\nsay what you will, is the great high road to his reason.”\n\nBusiness executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to strikers. For example, when 2,500\nemployees in the White Motor Company’s plant struck for higher wages and a union shop, Robert F. Black, then\npresident of the company, didn’t lose his temper and condemn and threaten and talk of tyranny and Communists.\nHe actually praised the strikers. He published an advertisement in the Cleveland papers, complimenting them on\n“the peaceful way in which they laid down their tools”. Finding the strike pickets idle, he bought them a couple\nof dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited them to play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling,\nhe rented a bowling alley.",

If you can’t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other\npeople they are wrong?\n\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can\nin words—and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have\nstruck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike\nback. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato\nor an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.\n\nNever begin by announcing “I am going to prove so-and-so to you.” That’s bad. That’s tantamount to\nsaying, “I’m smarter than you are, I’m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.”\n\nThat is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before you\neven start.\n\nIt is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change people’s minds. So why make it\nharder? Why handicap yourself?\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one\nwill feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you\ntaught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot.\n\nOver three hundred years ago Galileo said, “You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him\nto find it within himself.”",

Most of us are blighted with\npreconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don’t want to change\ntheir minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star. So, if you are\ninclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast. It is\nfrom James Harvey Robinson’s enlightening book The Mind in the Making.\n\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we\nare told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the\nformation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob\nus of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which\nis threatened…The little word ‘my’ is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is\nthe beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is ‘my’ dinner, ‘my’ dog, and ‘my’ house, or ‘my’\nfather, ‘my’ country, and ‘my’ God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car\nshabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of “Epictetus”, of the medicinal\nvalue of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have\nbeen accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions\nleads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning\nconsists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.\n\nCarl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On Becoming a Person:",

Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the\nreceiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson\nwon by her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the\nexample of John’s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction.\n\nAnother example in which everybody gains through this principle of arousing an eager want comes\nfrom Michael E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company.\nMike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service station was holding him\nback. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape\nthat sales were declining significantly.\n\nThis manager would not listen to any of Mike’s pleas to upgrade the station. After many exhortations\nand heart-to-heart talks—all of which had no impact—Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest\nShell station in his territory.",

Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is\n_non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You_\nhave hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And…\n\n_A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still._\n\nYears ago Patrick J. O’Haire joined one of my classes. He had had little education, and how he loved a\nscrap! He had once been a chauffeur, and he came to me because he had been trying, without much success, to\nsell trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he was continually scrapping with and antagonizing the\n\n\n-----\n\nvery people he was trying to do business with. If a prospect said anything derogatory about the trucks he was\nselling, Pat saw red and was right at the customer’s throat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those days. As he said\nto me afterward, “I often walked out of an office saying, ‘I told that bird something.’ Sure I had told him\nsomething, but I hadn’t sold him anything.”\n\nMv first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O’Haire to talk. My immediate task was to train him to\nrefrain from talking and to avoid verbal fights.\n\nMr. O’Haire became one of the star salesmen for the White Motor Company in New York. How did he\ndo it? Here is his story in his own words: “If I walk into a buyer’s office now and he says, ‘What? A White\ntruck? They’re no good! I wouldn’t take one if you gave it to me. I’m going to buy the Whose-It truck,’ I say,\n‘The Whose-It is a good truck. If you buy the Whose-It, you’ll never make a mistake.

Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the\nliving room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s\nnormal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind\nto go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the\nbest frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to\nkindergarten?” He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing\nsongs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started finger-painting on the kitchen\ntable—my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner.\nNext he was begging to participate. ‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’\nWith all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand, telling him\nall the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs\nand found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to\ngo to kindergarten. I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager\nwant that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.”\n\nTomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask\nyourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?”\n\nThat question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.\n\nAt one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in\norder to hold a series of lectures.",

Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea\nwhile the other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a\nsentence.\n\nDo you know people like that? I do, unfortunately; and the astonishing part of it is that some of them\nare prominent.\n\nBores, that is all they are—bores intoxicated with their own egos, drunk with a sense of their own\nimportance.\n\nPeople who talk only of themselves think only of themselves. And “those people who think only of\nthemselves,” Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, longtime president of Columbia University, said, “are hopelessly\nuneducated. They are not educated,” said Dr. Butler, “no matter how instructed they may be.”\n\nSo if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested.\nAsk questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their\naccomplishments.\n\nRemember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and\ntheir wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person’s toothache means more to that\n\n\n-----\n\nperson than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one’s neck interests one more than forty\nearthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**_Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves._**\n\n\n-----\n\n## 8\n\n###### “HOW TO INTEREST PEOPLE.”",

Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.\n\n5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.\n\n_6._ When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he\npersonally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: “John, we have customers coming in tomorrow\nand I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish\nthe counter.” Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the\ntask: “John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it\n_later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the_\nstockroom, but it is in poor shape.

HE WHO CANNOT WALKS A LONELY WAY.”\n\nI often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very fond of strawberries and\ncream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think\nabout what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn’t bait the hook with strawberries and cream.\nRather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said, “Wouldn’t you like to have that?”\n\nWhy not use the same common sense when fishing for people?\n\nThat is what Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister during World War I, did. When someone\nasked him how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime leaders—Wilson, Orlando and\nClemenceau—had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed to any one thing, it\nwould be to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.\n\nWhy talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you\nwant. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in\nwhat we want.\n\nSo the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how\nto get it.",

I was planning at the time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the\ntourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and address were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately\noverwhelmed with scores of letters and booklets and printed testimonials from camps and guides. I was\nbewildered. I didn’t know which to choose. Then one camp owner did a clever thing. He sent me the names and\ntelephone numbers of several New York people who had stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone\nthem and discover for myself what he had to offer.\n\nI found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I telephoned him, found out what his\nexperience had been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.\n\nThe others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself.

  "response": "### Part Three: How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking\n\nThis section focuses on strategies for effectively persuading others and influencing their opinions without causing conflict or resentment. It emphasizes the importance of respectful communication and understanding different perspectives. Here are the key principles outlined in this part:\n\n1. **The Only Way to Get the Best of an Argument is to Avoid It**: Engaging in arguments often leads to resentment and does not change opinions. Instead, it is better to sidestep confrontations.\n\n2. **Show Respect for the Other Person's Opinions**: Avoid directly telling someone they are wrong. Instead, acknowledge their viewpoint to foster a more open dialogue.\n\n3. **If You Are Wrong, Admit It Quickly and Emphatically**: Acknowledging your mistakes can build trust and respect, making others more receptive to your ideas.\n\n4. **Begin in a Friendly Way**: Starting conversations on a positive note can set a constructive tone for discussions.\n\n5. **Get the Other Person Saying “Yes, Yes” Immediately**: Find common ground early in the conversation to create a sense of agreement and cooperation.\n\n6. **Let the Other Person Do a Great Deal of the Talking**: Encourage others to express their thoughts and feelings, which can lead to a more productive conversation.\n\n7. **Let the Other Person Feel That the Idea is Theirs**: When people feel ownership over an idea, they are more likely to support it.\n\n8. **Try Honestly to See Things from the Other Person's Point of View**: Empathy is crucial in understanding and addressing the concerns of others.\n\n9. **Be Sympathetic with the Other Person's Ideas and Desires**: Acknowledging and validating others' feelings can help in persuading them.\n\n10. **Appeal to the Nobler Motives**: Frame your arguments in a way that appeals to the other person's values and principles.\n\n11. **Dramatize Your Ideas**: Present your ideas in a compelling and engaging manner to capture attention.\n\n12. **Throw Down a Challenge**: Presenting a challenge can motivate others to engage and participate actively.\n\n### Summary\nPart Three emphasizes that effective persuasion is not about winning arguments but about fostering understanding and cooperation. By employing these principles, individuals can influence others positively and constructively, leading to better relationships and outcomes. The focus is on empathy, respect, and creating a collaborative environment.",
