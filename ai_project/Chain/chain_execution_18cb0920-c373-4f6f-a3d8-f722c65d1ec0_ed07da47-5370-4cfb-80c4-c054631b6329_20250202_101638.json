      "content": "Chapter 17, titled **\"A formula that will work wonders for you,\"** presents a formula for influencing others positively and effectively. Here are the key points discussed in this chapter:\n\n1. **Understanding Human Nature**: The chapter emphasizes the importance of recognizing that people are motivated by their own desires and interests. To influence others, one must understand what they want.\n\n2. **Arousing Eager Wants**: The formula suggests that to persuade someone, you should first identify and arouse in them an eager want. This means framing your request or suggestion in a way that aligns with their interests and desires.\n\n3. **Creating a Win-Win Situation**: The chapter highlights the significance of making the other person feel that they will benefit from the action you want them to take. This creates a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit.\n\n4. **Effective Communication**: It is important to communicate your ideas in a way that resonates with the other person's values and goals. This involves using language and examples that they can relate to.\n\n5. **Empathy and Understanding**: The chapter stresses the need for empathy—putting yourself in the other person's shoes to understand their perspective and motivations.\n\n6. **Practical Application**: The author encourages readers to apply this formula in various situations, whether in personal relationships, business negotiations, or social interactions, to achieve better outcomes.\n\nOverall, this chapter provides a practical approach to influencing others by focusing on their wants and framing requests in a way that highlights mutual benefits."

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n-----\n\nI knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations extended by friends, invitations\ncoming from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least\ncontented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and toothis and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it,\nhe suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about\nthe refusal, He immediately changed the other person’s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the\ninvitation.\n\nGunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an employee in the food store he\nmanaged who was negligent about putting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were displayed.\nThis caused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders, admonitions, confrontations, with her about this\ndid not do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his office and told her he was appointing her\nSupervisor of Price Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the shelves\nproperly tagged. This new responsibility and title changed her attitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties\nsatisfactorily from then on.\n\nChildish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he created the Legion of Honor and\ndistributed 15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made eighteen of his generals “Marshals of France” and called his\ntroops the “Grand Army.” Napoleon was criticized for giving “toys” to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon\nreplied, “Men are ruled by toys.”\n\nThis technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and it will work for you. For\nexample, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running across and\ndestroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither worked. Then she tried giving the worst\nsinner in the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him her “detective” and put him in charge of\nkeeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her problem. Her “detective” built a bonfire in the backyard,\nheated an iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the lawn.\n\nThe effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change\nattitudes or behavior:\n\n1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and\nconcentrate on the benefits to the other person.\n\n2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.\n\n3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.\n\n4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.\n\n5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.\n\n_6._ When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he\npersonally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: “John, we have customers coming in tomorrow\nand I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish\nthe counter.” Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the\ntask: “John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it\n_later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the_\nstockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and\npolish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good\n_company image.”_\n\nWill John be happy about doing what you suggest? Probably not very happy, but happier than if you\nhad not pointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is\ninterested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been\npointed out to John that the job would have to be done eventually and by doing it now, he won’t be faced with it\nlater.\n\nIt is naive to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these\napproaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this way than\n\n-----\n\nby not using these principles—and if you increase your successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become\n10 percent more effective as a leader than you were before—and that is your benefit.\n\nPeople are more likely to do what you would like them to do when you use…\n\n**PRINCIPLE 9**\n**_Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**BE A LEADER**\n\n**A leader’s job often includes changing your people’s attitudes and behavior. Some suggestions to**\n**accomplish this:**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**Begin with praise and honest appreciation.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 5**\n**Let the other person save face.**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 6**\n**Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n###### “THE SAFETY VALVE IN HANDLING COMPLAINTS.”\n\nMost people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves? Let the\nother people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do. So ask them\nquestions. Let them tell you a few things.\n\nIf you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But don’t. It is dangerous. They won’t pay\nattention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen patiently and\nwith an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.\n\nDoes this policy pay in business? Let’s see. Here is the story of a sales representative who was forced\nto try it.\n\nOne of the largest automobile manufacturers in the United States was negotiating for a year’s\nrequirements of upholstery fabrics. Three important manufacturers had worked up fabrics in sample bodies.\nThese had all been inspected by the executives of the motor company, and notice had been sent to each\nmanufacturer saying that, on a certain day, a representative from each supplier would be given an opportunity to\nmake a final plea for the contract.\n\nG.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived in town with a severe attack of laryngitis. “When\nit came my turn to meet the executives in conference,” Mr. R---- said as he related the story before one of my\nclasses, “I had lost my voice. I could hardly whisper. I was ushered into a room and found myself face to face\nwith the textile engineer, the purchasing agent, the director of sales and the president of the company. I stood up\nand made a valiant effort to speak, but I couldn’t do anything more than squeak.\n\n“They were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper: ‘Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I\nam speechless.’\n\n“‘I’ll do the talking for you,’ the president said. He did. He exhibited my samples and praised their\ngood points. A lively discussion arose about the merits of my goods. And the president, since he was talking for\nme, took the position I would have had during the discussion. My sole participation consisted of smiles, nods\nand a few gestures.\n\n“As a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract, which called for over half a million\nyards of upholstery fabrics at an aggregate value of $1,600,000—the biggest order I had ever received.\n\n“I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn’t lost my voice, because I had the wrong idea about the\nwhole proposition. I discovered, quite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to let the other person do the\ntalking.’\n\nLetting the other person do the talking helps in family situations as well as in business. Barbara\nWilson’s relationship with her daughter, Laurie, was deteriorating rapidly. Laurie, who had been a quiet,\ncomplacent child, had grown into an uncooperative, sometimes belligerent teenager. Mrs. Wilson lectured her,\nthreatened her and punished her, but all to no avail.\n\n“One day,” Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, “I just gave up. Laurie had disobeyed me and had left\nthe house to visit her girl friend before she had completed her chores. When she returned I was about to scream\nat her for the ten-thousandth time, but I just didn’t have the strength to do it. I just looked at her and said sadly,\n‘Why, Laurie, Why?’\n\n“Laurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked, ‘Do you really want to know?’ I nodded and\nLaurie told me, first hesitantly, and then it all flowed out. I had never listened to her. I was always telling her to\ndo this or that. When she wanted to tell me her thoughts, feelings, ideas, I interrupted with more orders. I began\n\n-----\n\nto realize that she needed me—not as a bossy mother, but as a confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about\ngrowing up. And all I had been doing was talking when I should have been listening. I never heard her.\n\n“From that time on I let her do all the talking she wanted. She tells me what is on her mind, and our\nrelationship has improved immeasurably. She is again a cooperative person.”\n\nA large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New York newspaper calling for a person\nwith unusual ability and experience. Charles T. Cubellis answered the advertisement, sending his reply to a box\nnumber. A few days later, he was invited by letter to call for an interview. Before he called, he spent hours in\nWall Street finding out everything possible about the person who had founded the business. During the\ninterview, he remarked, “I should be mighty proud to be associated with an organization with a record like yours.\nI understand you started twenty-eight years ago with nothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that true?”\n\nAlmost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early struggles. This man was no exception.\nHe talked for a long time about how he had started with $450 in cash and an original idea. He told how he had\nfought against discouragement and battled against ridicule, working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen\nhours a day; how he had finally won against all odds until now the most important executives on Wall Street\nwere coming to him for information and guidance. He was proud of such a record. He had a right to be, and he\nhad a splendid time telling about it. Finally, he questioned Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called\nin one of his vice presidents and said, “I think this is the person we are looking for.”\n\nMr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the accomplishments of his prospective employer.\nHe showed an interest in the other person and his problems. He encouraged the other person to do most of the\ntalking—and made a favorable impression.\n\nRoy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite problem. He listened as a good prospect\nfor a sales position talked himself into a job with Bradley’s firm, Roy reported:\n\n“Being a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits, such as hospitalization, medical insurance\nand pensions. Every representative is an independent agent. We don’t even provide leads for prospects, as we\ncannot advertise for them as our larger competitors do.\n\n“Richard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted for this position, and he was interviewed first by\nmy assistant, who told him about all the negatives related to this job. He seemed slightly discouraged when he\ncame into my office. I mentioned the one benefit of being associated with my firm, that of being an independent\ncontractor and therefore virtually being self-employed.\n\n“As he talked about these advantages to me, he talked himself out of each negative thought he had\nwhen he came in for the interview. Several times it seemed as though he was half talking to himself as he was\nthinking through each thought. At times I was tempted to add to his thoughts; however, as the interview came to\na close I felt he had convinced himself, very much on his own, that he would like to work for my firm.\n\n“Because I had been a good listener and let Dick do most of the talking, he was able to weigh both\nsides fairly in his mind, and he came to the positive conclusion, which was a challenge he created for himself.\nWe hired him and he has been an outstanding representative for our firm.”\n\nEven our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast about\nours. La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said, “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want\nfriends, let your friends excel you.”\n\nWhy is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them,\nthey—or at least some of them—will feel inferior and envious.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n-----\n\ninterest of adults and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to\nmake people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.\n\nSo the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such a course for adults in Meriden. They\nsearched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found not one. Finally they approached one of the\nworld’s outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of\nthis group. “No,” he replied, \"I know what those adults want. But the book they need has never been written.”\n\nI knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself had been searching for years to\ndiscover a practical, working handbook on human relations.\n\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope\nyou like it.\n\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on the subject—everything from\nnewspaper columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the\nnew psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to spend one and a half years in various libraries\nreading everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring over hundreds of\nmagazine articles, searching through countless biographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages\nhad dealt with people. We read their biographies; we read the life stories of all great leaders from Julius Caesar\nto Thomas Edison. I recall that we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were\ndetermined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout\nthe ages for winning friends and influencing people.\n\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them world-famous inventors like\nMarconi and Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen\nD. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford, and explorers like Martin Johnson, and tried to\ndiscover the techniques they used in human relations.\n\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. I\nsay “short.” It was short in the beginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty\nminutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.\n\nI gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their business and social contacts, and then\ncome back to class and speak about their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an interesting\nassignment! These men and women, hungry for self-improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a\nnew kind of laboratory—the first and only laboratory of human relationships for adults that had ever existed.\n\nThis book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and\ndeveloped out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands of adults.\n\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger than a postcard. The next season we\nprinted a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen\nyears of experiment and research came this book.\n\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible\nas it sounds, I have seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives of many people.\n\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses. For years, he had driven and\ncriticized and condemned his employees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of appreciation and\nencouragement were alien to his lips. After studying the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply\naltered his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new\nspirit of teamwork. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he proudly said\nin a speech before the class: “When I used to walk through my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees\nactually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But now they are all my friends and even the\njanitor calls me by my first name.”\n\nThis employer gained more profit, more leisure and—what is infinitely more important—he found far\nmore happiness in his business and in his home.\n\n-----\n\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales by the use of these principles.\nMany have opened up new accounts—accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been\ngiven increased authority, increased pay. One executive reported a large increase in salary because he applied\nthese truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he\nwas sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This training not\nonly saved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion with increased pay.\n\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at the end of the course have told me\nthat their homes have been much happier since their husbands or wives started this training.\n\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases,\nin their enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn’t wait forty-eight\nhours to report their achievements at the regular session of the course.\n\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into the night discussing them with\nother members of the class. At three o’clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so shaken by a\nrealization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a new and richer world opening before him, that he\nwas unable to sleep. He didn’t sleep that night or the next day or the next night.\n\nWho was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any new theory that came along? No, far\nfrom it. He was a sophisticated, blasé dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three languages\nfluently and was a graduate of two European universities.\n\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the old school, an aristocrat whose\nforebears had served for generations as professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written\nfrom a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.\n\nAnother man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet\nfactory, declared he had learned more in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine art of\ninfluencing people than he had learned about the same subject during his four years in college. Absurd?\nLaughable? Fantastic? Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this statement with whatever adjective you wish.\nI am merely reporting, without comment, a declaration made by a conservative and eminently successful\nHarvard graduate in a public address to approximately six hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the\nevening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.\n\n“Compared to what we ought to be,” said the famous Professor William James of Harvard, “compared\nto what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and\nmental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses\npowers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.”\n\nThose powers which you “habitually fail to use”! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover,\ndevelop and profit by those dormant and unused assets.",

You did it.”\n\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t want him to do it—none of these\nthings kept the bed dry. So the parents asked, “How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”\n\nWhat were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like\nGrandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a\npair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object.\n\nHis mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said, “Here is a\nlittle gentleman who would like to do some shopping.”\n\nThe salesgirl made him feel important by saying, “Young man, what can I show you?”\n\nHe stood a couple of inches taller and said, “I want to buy a bed for myself.”\n\nWhen he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was\npersuaded to buy it.\n\nThe bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to the\ndoor shouting, “Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!”\n\nThe father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab’s injunction: he was “hearty in his approbation\nand lavish in his praise.”\n\n“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father said. “Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this\nbed.” The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it.\nAnd he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.\n\nAnother father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn’t get his threeyear-old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility.\nSo the parents asked themselves, “How can we make her want to do it?”\n\nThe little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a\nchair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen\nwhile she was stirring the cereal and she said, “Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.”\n\nShe ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She had\nachieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.\n\nWilliam Winter once remarked that “self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why\ncan’t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making\n\n-----\n\nothers think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own;\nthey will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.\n\nRemember: “First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world\nwith him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.\"\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Arouse in the other person an eager want._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_Don’t criticize, condemn or complain._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Give honest and sincere appreciation._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 3**\n**_Arouse in the other person an eager want._**\n\n-----\n\n# PART TWO\n\n### Six Ways To Make People Like You\n\n-----\n\n## 4\n\n###### “DO THIS AND YOU’LL BE WELCOME ANYWHERE.”\n\nWhy read this book to find out how to win friends? Why not study the technique of the greatest winner\nof friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When\nyou get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of\nhis skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there\nare no ulterior motives: he doesn’t want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn’t want to marry you.\n\nDid you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn’t have to work for a living? A hen\nhas to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you\nnothing but love.\n\nWhen I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired pup for fifty cents. He was the light\nand joy of my childhood. Every afternoon about four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes\nstaring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through the\nbuck brush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of sheer\necstasy.\n\nTippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic night—I shall never forget it—he\nwas killed within ten feet of my head, killed by lightning. Tippy’s death was the tragedy of my boyhood.\n\nYou never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn’t need to. You knew by some divine instinct\nthat you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in\ntwo years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that. You can make more friends in two\nmonths by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested\nin you.\n\nYet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into\nbecoming interested in them.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are\ninterested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.\n\nThe New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out\nwhich word is the most frequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun “I.” “I.” “I.” It was used\n3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. “I.” “I.” “I.” “I.” When you see a group photograph that you are in,\nwhose picture do you look for first?\n\nIf we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true,\nsincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.\n\nNapoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said, “Josephine, I have been as fortunate\nas any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can\nrely.” And historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.\n\nAlfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book entitled What Life Should Mean to You.\nIn that book he says, “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties\nin life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures\nspring.”\n\nYou may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming across a statement more\nsignificant for you and for me. Adler’s statement is so rich with meaning that I am going to repeat it in italics: It\n_is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the_\n_greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring._\n\n-----\n\nI once took a course in short-story writing at New York University, and during that course the editor of\na leading magazine talked to our class. He said he could pick up any one of the dozens of stories that drifted\nacross his desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he could feel whether or not the author liked\npeople. “If the author doesn’t like people,” he said, “people won’t like his or her stories.”\n\nThis hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on fiction writing and apologized for\npreaching a sermon. “I am telling you,” he said, “the same things your preacher would tell you, but remember,\nyou have to be interested in people if you want to be a successful writer of stories.”\n\nIf that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing with people face-to-face.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nIsaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed hundreds of celebrities, declared that many people\nfail to make a favorable impression because they don’t listen attentively. “They have been so much concerned\nwith what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears open. Very important people have told me\nthat they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good\ntrait.”\n\nAnd not only important personages crave a good listener, but ordinary folk do too. As the Reader’s\nDigest once said, “Many persons call a doctor when all they want is an audience.”\n\nDuring the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln wrote to an old friend in Springfield, Illinois, asking\nhim to come to Washington. Lincoln said he had some problems he wanted to discuss with him. The old\nneighbor called at the White House, and Lincoln talked to him for hours about the advisability of issuing a\nproclamation freeing the slaves. Lincoln went over all the arguments for and against such a move, and then read\nletters and newspaper articles, some denouncing him for not freeing the slaves and others denouncing him for\nfear he was going to free them. After talking for hours, Lincoln shook hands with his old neighbor, said good\nnight, and sent him back to Illinois without even asking for his opinion. Lincoln had done all the talking himself.\nThat seemed to clarify his mind. “He seemed to feel easier after that talk,” the old friend said. Lincoln hadn’t\nwanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself.\nThat’s what we all want when we are in trouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the\ndissatisfied employee or the hurt friend.\n\nOne of the great listeners of modern times was Sigmund Freud. A man who met Freud described his\nmanner of listening, “It struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities which I had never\nseen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated attention. There was none of that piercing ‘soulpenetrating gaze’ business. His eyes were mild and genial. His voice was low and kind. His gestures were few.\nBut the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary.\n_You've no idea what it meant to be listened to like that.”_\n\nIf you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise\nyou, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea\nwhile the other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a\nsentence.\n\nDo you know people like that? I do, unfortunately; and the astonishing part of it is that some of them\nare prominent.\n\nBores, that is all they are—bores intoxicated with their own egos, drunk with a sense of their own\nimportance.\n\nPeople who talk only of themselves think only of themselves. And “those people who think only of\nthemselves,” Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, longtime president of Columbia University, said, “are hopelessly\nuneducated. They are not educated,” said Dr. Butler, “no matter how instructed they may be.”\n\nSo if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested.\nAsk questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their\naccomplishments.\n\nRemember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and\ntheir wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person’s toothache means more to that\n\n-----\n\nperson than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one’s neck interests one more than forty\nearthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 4**\n**_Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves._**\n\n-----\n\n## 8\n\n###### “HOW TO INTEREST PEOPLE.”\n\nEveryone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at the range and diversity of his\nknowledge. Whether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt\nknew what to say. And how was it done? The answer was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat\nup late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.\n\nFor Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the\nthings he or she treasures most.\n\nThe genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor of literature at Yale, learned this lesson early in\nlife.\n\n“When I was eight years old and was spending a weekend visiting my Aunt Libby Linsley at her home\nin Stratford on the Housatonic,” he wrote in his essay on Human Nature, “a middle-aged man called one\nevening, and after a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his attention to me. At that time, I happened to be\nexcited about boats, and the visitor discussed the subject in a way that seemed to me particularly interesting.\nAfter he left, I spoke of him with enthusiasm. What a man! My aunt informed me he was a New York lawyer,\nthat he cared nothing whatever about boats—that he took not the slightest interest in the subject. ‘But why then\ndid he talk all the time about boats?’\n\n“‘Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested in boats, and he talked about the things he\nknew would interest and please you. He made himself agreeable.’”\n\nAnd William Lyon Phelps added, “I never forgot my aunt’s remark.”\n\nAs I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from Edward L. Chalif, who was active in Boy Scout\nwork.\n\n“One day I found I needed a favor,” wrote Mr. Chalif. “A big Scout jamboree was coming off in\nEurope, and I wanted the president of one of the largest corporations in America to pay the expenses of one of\nmy boys for the trip.\n\n“Fortunately, just before I went to see this man, I heard that he had drawn a check for a million dollars,\nand that after it was canceled, he had had it framed.\n\n“So the first thing I did when I entered his office was to ask to see the check. A check for a million\ndollars! I told him I never knew that anybody had ever written such a check, and that I wanted to tell my boys\nthat I had actually seen a check for a million dollars. He gladly showed it to me; I admired it and asked him to\ntell me all about how it happened to be drawn.”\n\nYou notice, don’t you, that Mr. Chalif didn’t begin by talking about the Boy Scouts, or the jamboree in\nEurope, or what it was he wanted? He talked in terms of what interested the other man. Here’s the result:\n\n“Presently, the man I was interviewing said, ‘Oh, by the way, what was it you wanted to see me\nabout?’ So I told him.\n\n“To my vast surprise,” Mr. Chalif continues, “he not only granted immediately what I asked for, but\nmuch more. I had asked him to send only one boy to Europe, but he sent five boys and myself, gave me a letter\nof credit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in Europe for seven weeks. He also gave me letters of\nintroduction to his branch presidents, putting them at our service, and he himself met us in Paris and showed us\nthe town.\n\n-----\n\nSince then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose parents were in want, and he is still active in\nour group.\n\n“Yet I know if I hadn’t found out what he was interested in, and got him warmed up first, I wouldn’t\nhave found him one-tenth as easy to approach.”\n\nIs this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it? Let’s see, Take Henry G. Duvernoy of Duvemoy\nand Sons, a wholesale baking firm in New York.\n\nMr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York hotel. He had called on the manager\nevery week for four years. He went to the same social affairs the manager attended. He even took rooms in the\nhotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he failed.",

Duvernoy of Duvemoy\nand Sons, a wholesale baking firm in New York.\n\nMr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York hotel. He had called on the manager\nevery week for four years. He went to the same social affairs the manager attended. He even took rooms in the\nhotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he failed.\n\n“Then,” said Mr. Duvernoy, “after studying human relations, I resolved to change my tactics. I decided\nto find out what interested this man—what caught his enthusiasm.\n\n“I discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called the Hotel Greeters of America. He not\nonly belonged, but his bubbling enthusiasm had made him president of the organization, and president of the\nInternational Greeters. No matter where its conventions were held, he would be there.\n\n“So when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the Greeters. What a response I got. What a\nresponse! He talked to me for half an hour about the Greeters, his tones vibrant with enthusiasm. I could plainly\nsee that this society was not only his hobby; it was the passion of his life. Before I left his office, he had ‘sold’\nme a membership in his organization.\n\n“In the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But a few days later, the steward of his hotel phoned\nme to come over with samples and prices.\n\n“‘I don’t know what you did to the old boy,’ the steward greeted me, ‘but he sure is sold on you!’\n\n“Think of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years—trying to get his business—and I’d still\nbe drumming at him if I hadn’t finally taken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and what he\nenjoyed talking about.”\n\nEdward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose to live in the beautiful Cumberland Valley of\nMaryland after he completed his military service. Unfortunately, at that time there were few jobs available in the\narea. A little research uncovered the fact that a number of companies in the area were either owned or controlled\nby an unusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser, whose rise from poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman.\nHowever, he was known for being inaccessible to job seekers. Mr. Harriman wrote:\n\n“I interviewed a number of people and found that his major interest was anchored in his drive for\npower and money. Since he protected himself from people like me by use of a dedicated and stern secretary, I\nstudied her interests and goals and only then I paid an unannounced visit at her office. She had been Mr.\nFunkhouser’s orbiting satellite for about fifteen years. When I told her I had a proposition for him which might\ntranslate itself into financial and political success for him, she became enthused. I also conversed with her about\nher constructive participation in his success. After this conversation she arranged for me to meet Mr.\nFunkhouser.\n\n“I entered his huge and impressive office determined not to ask directly for a job. He was seated behind\na large carved desk and thundered at me, ‘How about it, young man?’ I said, ‘Mr. Funkhouser, I believe I can\nmake money for you.’ He immediately rose and invited me to sit in one of the large upholstered chairs. I\nenumerated my ideas and the qualifications I had to realize these ideas, as well as how they would contribute to\nhis personal success and that of his businesses.\n\n“‘R. J.’, as he became known to me, hired me at once and for over twenty years I have grown in his\nenterprises and we both have prospered.”\n\nTalking in terms of the other person’s interests pays off for both parties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in\nthe field of employee communications, has always followed this principle. When asked what reward he got from\n\n-----\n\nit, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only received a different reward from each person but that in general the\nreward had been an enlargement of his life each time he spoke to someone.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 5**\n**_Talk in terms of the other person’s interests._**\n\n-----\n\n## 9\n\n###### “HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU INSTANTLY.”\n\nI was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirty-third Street and Eighth Avenue in\nNew York. I noticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the job—weighing envelopes, handing out stamps,\nmaking change, issuing receipts—the same monotonous grind year after year. So I said to myself, “I am going\nto try to make that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself,\nbut about him. So I asked myself, ‘What is there about him that I can honestly admire?’” That is sometimes a\nhard question to answer, especially with strangers; but, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw\nsomething I admired no end.\n\nSo while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm, “I certainly wish I had your head\nof hair.”\n\nHe looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with smiles. “Well, it isn’t as good as it used to be,” he\nsaid modestly. I assured him that although it might have lost some of its pristine glory, nevertheless it was still\nmagnificent. He was immensely pleased. We carried on a pleasant little conversation and the last thing he said\nto me was: “Many people have admired my hair.”\n\nI’ll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I’ll bet he went home that night and told\nhis wife about it. I’ll bet he looked in the mirror and said, “It is a beautiful head of hair.”\n\nI told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards, “What did you want to get out of him?”\n\nWhat was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying to get out of him!!!\n\nIf we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest\nappreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return—if our souls are no bigger than\nsour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve. Oh yes, I did want something out of that\nchap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for him without his\nbeing able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory lung\nafter the incident is past.\n\nThere is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into\ntrouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant\nwe break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel\n_important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in_\nhuman nature; and William James said, “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be\nappreciated.” As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge\nthat has been responsible for civilization itself.\n\nPhilosophers have been speculating on the rules of human relationships for thousands of years, and out\nof all that speculation, there has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as old as history.\nZoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China\ntwenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han.\nBuddha preached it on the bank of the Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books of\nHinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries\nago. Jesus summed it up in one thought—probably the most important rule in the world: “Do unto others as you\nwould have others do unto you.”",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n“Several years ago I was on the management team of a small company. Headquartered near us was the\ndistrict office of a large insurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and our company was\nassigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.\n\n“One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that his company had just\nintroduced a new life insurance policy for executives and thought we might be interested later on and he would\nget back to us when he had more information on it.\n\n“The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a coffee break, and he shouted, ‘Hey\nLuke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.’ He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an\nexecutive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day (it was the same policy that Carl had\ncasually mentioned). He wanted us to have one of the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about the\ncoverage and ended saying, ‘The policy is so new, I’m going to have someone from the home office come out\ntomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let’s get the applications signed and on the way so he can have\nmore information to work with.’ His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though we still\ndid not have details. When they were made available to us, they confirmed John’s initial understanding of the\npolicy, and he not only sold each of us a policy, but later doubled our coverage.\n\n“Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us any desire for the policies.”\n\nThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly\ntries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and\none of America’s great business leaders, once said, “People who can put themselves in the place of other people\nwho can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.”\n\n-----\n\nIf out of reading this book you get just one thing—an increased tendency to think always in terms of\nother people’s point of view, and see things from their angle—if you get that one thing out of this book, it may\neasily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.\n\nLooking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to\nbe construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his\ndetriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the\nreceiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson\nwon by her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the\nexample of John’s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction.\n\nAnother example in which everybody gains through this principle of arousing an eager want comes\nfrom Michael E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company.\nMike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service station was holding him\nback. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape\nthat sales were declining significantly.\n\nThis manager would not listen to any of Mike’s pleas to upgrade the station. After many exhortations\nand heart-to-heart talks—all of which had no impact—Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest\nShell station in his territory.\n\nThe manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that when Mike visited him the next\ntime, his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to reach the Number One\nspot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn’t helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager,\nby showing him the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.\n\nMost people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of calculus without\never discovering how their own minds function. For instance: I once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the\nyoung college graduates who were entering the employ of the Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner\nmanufacturer. One of the participants wanted to persuade the others to play basketball in their free time, and this\nis about what he said, “I want you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few\ntimes I’ve been to the gymnasium there haven’t been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got to\nthrowing the ball around the other night—and I got a black eye. I wish all of you would come down tomorrow\nnight. I want to play basketball.”\n\nDid he talk about anything you want? You don’t want to go to a gymnasium that no one else goes to,\ndo you? You don’t care about what he wants. You don’t want to get a black eye.\n\nCould he have shown you how to get the things you want by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep.\nKeener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games. Basketball.\n\nTo repeat Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who\n_can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way._\n\nOne of the students in the author’s training course was worried about his little boy. The child was\nunderweight and refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and nagged. “Mother\nwants you to eat this and that.” “Father wants you to grow up to be a big man.”\n\nDid the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as you pay to one fleck of sand on a\nsandy beach.\n\nNo one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old to react to the viewpoint of a\nfather thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father had expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that.\nSo he said to himself, “What does that boy want? How can I tie up what I want to what he wants?”\n\nIt was easy for the father when he starting thinking about it. His boy had a tricycle that he loved to ride\nup and down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn. A few doors down the street lived a bully—a\nbigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it himself.\n\n-----\n\nNaturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she would have to come out and take\nthe bully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again. This happened almost every day.\n\nWhat did the little boy want? It didn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to answer that one. His pride, his anger,\nhis desire for a feeling of importance—all the strongest emotions in his makeup—goaded him to get revenge, to\nsmash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights\nout of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat—when his father\npromised him that—there was no longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach,\nsauerkraut, salt mackerel—anything in order to be big enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so\noften.\n\nAfter solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little boy had the unholy habit of wetting\nhis bed.\n\nHe slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother would wake up and feel the sheet and\nsay, “Look, Johnny, what you did again last night.”\n\nHe would say, “No, I didn’t do it. You did it.”\n\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t want him to do it—none of these\nthings kept the bed dry. So the parents asked, “How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”",

Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This_\nonly raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding.\n\n_Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and_\nareas on which you agree.\n\n_Be honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will_\nhelp disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness.\n\n_Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents_\nmay be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and\nfind yourself in a position where your opponents can say, “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.”\n\n_Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is_\ninterested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn\nyour opponents into friends.\n\n_Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be_\nheld later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask\nyourself some hard questions:\n\nCould my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my\nreaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my\nopponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of\nme? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow\nover? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?\n\n- Bits and Pieces, published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J.\n\n-----\n\nOpera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said, “My wife and I made a pact\na long time ago, and we’ve kept it no matter how angry we’ve grown with each other. When one yells, the other\nshould listen, because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it._**\n\n-----\n\n## 11\n\n###### “A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIES—AND HOW TO AVOID IT.”\n\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed that if he could be right 75 percent of\nthe time, he would reach the highest measure of his expectation.\n\nIf that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men of the twentieth century could\nhope to obtain, what about you and me?\n\nIf you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make\na million dollars a day. If you can’t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other\npeople they are wrong?\n\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can\nin words—and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have\nstruck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike\nback. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato\nor an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.\n\nNever begin by announcing “I am going to prove so-and-so to you.” That’s bad. That’s tantamount to\nsaying, “I’m smarter than you are, I’m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.”\n\nThat is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before you\neven start.\n\nIt is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change people’s minds. So why make it\nharder? Why handicap yourself?\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one\nwill feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you\ntaught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot.\n\nOver three hundred years ago Galileo said, “You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him\nto find it within himself.”\n\nAs Lord Chesterfield said to his son, “Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.”\n\nSocrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens, “One thing only I know, and that is that I know\nnothing.”\n\nWell, I can’t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling people they are wrong. And I\nfind that it pays.\n\nIf a person makes a statement that you think is wrong—yes, even that you know is wrong—isn’t it\nbetter to begin by saying, “Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I\nam wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\nThere’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as, “I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the\nfacts.”\n\nNobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to\nyour saying, “I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\n-----\n\nOne of our class members who used this approach in dealing with customers was Harold Reinke, a\nDodge dealer in Billings, Montana. He reported that because of the pressures of the automobile business, he was\noften hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers’ complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of\nbusiness and general unpleasantness.\n\nHe told his class, “Recognizing that this was getting me nowhere fast, I tried a new tack. I would say\nsomething like this, ‘Our dealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently ashamed. We may have\nerred in your case. Tell me about it.’\n\n“This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the customer releases his feelings, he is\nusually much more reasonable when it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers have thanked me\nfor having such an understanding attitude. And two of them have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In\nthis highly competitive market, we need more of this type of customer, and I believe that showing respect for all\ncustomers’ opinions and treating them diplomatically and courteously will help beat the competition.”\n\nYou will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and\ninspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit\nthat he, too, may be wrong.\n\nIf you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell him or her so, what happens? Let me\nillustrate. Mr. S---- a young New York attorney, once argued a rather important case before the United States\nSupreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280 U.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of money\nand an important question of law. During the argument, one of the Supreme Court justices said to him, “The\nstatute of limitations in admiralty law is six years, is it not?”\n\nMr. S---- stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment, and then said bluntly, “Your Honor, there is no\nstatute of limitations in admiralty.”\n\n“A hush fell on the court,” said Mr. S---- as he related his experience to one of the author’s classes,\n“and the temperature in the room seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice—was wrong. And I had told him\nso. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke\nbetter than I ever spoke before. But I didn’t persuade. I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and\nfamous man that he was wrong.”",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\n- Dr Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.\n\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home. Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I\nall but worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off\nby needless fires. These fires weren’t caused by careless smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters\nwho went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires\nraged so fiercely that the fire department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.\n\nThere was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who started a fire was liable to fine and\nimprisonment, but the sign stood in an unfrequented part of the park, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A\nmounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he didn’t take his duties too seriously, and the fires\ncontinued to spread season after season. On one occasion, I rushed up to a policeman and told him about a fire\nspreading rapidly through the park and wanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied\nthat it was none of his business because it wasn’t in his precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went\n\n-----\n\nriding, I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect the public domain. In the beginning, I am afraid I\ndidn’t even attempt to see the other people’s point of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so\nunhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn\nthem that they could be jailed for starting a fire, order with a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they\nrefused, I would threaten to have them arrested. I was merely unloading my feelings without thinking of their\npoint of view.\n\nThe result? They obeyed…obeyed sullenly and with resentment. After I rode on over the hill, they\nprobably rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park.\n\nWith the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of human relations, a little more tact,\na somewhat greater tendency to see things from the other person’s standpoint. Then, instead of giving orders, I\nwould ride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:\n\n“Having a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for supper? I loved to build fires myself when\nI was a boy, and I still love to. But you know they are very dangerous here in the park. I know you boys don’t\nmean to do any harm, but other boys aren’t so careful. They come along and see that you have built a fire; so\nthey build one and don’t put it out when they go home and it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees.\nWe won’t have any trees here at all if we aren’t more careful. You could be put in jail for building this fire. But\nI don’t want to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure. I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won’t you\nplease rake all the leaves away from the fire right now, and you’ll be careful to cover it with dirt, a lot of dirt,\nbefore you leave, won’t you? And the next time you want to have some fun, won’t you please build your fire\nover the hill there in the sandpit? It can’t do any harm there. Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time.”\n\nWhat a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to cooperate. No sullenness, no\nresentment. They hadn’t been forced to obey orders. They had saved their faces. They felt better and I felt better\nbecause I had handled the situation with consideration for their point of view.\n\nSeeing things through another person’s eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become\noverwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car payment. “On\na Friday,” she reported, \"I received a nasty phone call from the man who was handling my account informing\nme if I did not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate further action from the company. I had\nno way of raising the money over the weekend, so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday\nmorning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked at the situation from his point of view. I\napologized most sincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his most\ntroublesome customer as this was not the first time I was behind in my payments. His tone of voice changed\nimmediately, and he reassured me that I was far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He went on\nto tell me several examples of how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him and often tried to\navoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any\nsuggestion from me, he said it did not matter if I couldn’t pay all the money immediately. It would be all right if\nI paid him $20 by the end of the month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me to do so.”\n\nTomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product or contribute to your favorite\ncharity, why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from another person’s point\nof view? Ask yourself: “Why should he or she want to do it?” True, this will take time, but it will avoid making\nenemies and will get better results, and with less friction and less shoe leather.\n\n“I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview,” said\nDean Donham of the Harvard business school, “than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I\nwas going to say and what that person—from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to\nanswer.”\n\nThat is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the sake of emphasis.\n\n_I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than_\n_step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person—from my_\n_knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to answer._\n\n-----\n\nIf, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing—an increased tendency to think always in\nterms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from that person’s angle as well as your own - if you\nget only that one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping stones of your career.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 8**\n**_Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view._**\n\n-----\n\n## 18\n\n###### “WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS.”\n\nWouldn't you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good\nwill, and make the other person listen attentively?\n\nYes? All right. Here it is: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would\nundoubtedly feel just as you do.”\n\nAn answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive. And you can say that and be 100\npercent sincere, because if you were the other person you, of course, would feel just as he does. Take Al Capone,\nfor example. Suppose you had inherited the same body and temperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose\nyou had had his environment and experiences. You would then be precisely what he was, and where he was. For\nit is those things—and only those things—that made him what he was. The only reason, for example, that you\nare not a rattlesnake is that your mother and father weren’t rattlesnakes.\n\nYou deserve very little credit for being what you are—and remember, the people who come to you\nirritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils.\nPity them. Sympathize with them. Say to yourself, “There, but for the grace of God, go I.”\n\nThree-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to\nthem, and they will love you.",

The first shipment of these\nmachines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So\nwe should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how\nthey can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send\nmy car for you at any hour you specify.\n\n“I was surprised to get that letter,” Dr. L ---- said as he related the incident before the class. “I was both\nsurprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel\nimportant. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the\nequipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I liked it.\n\n“Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that equipment for the hospital was my\nown. I sold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.”\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson in his essay “Self-Reliance” stated, “In every work of genius we recognize our\nown rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”\n\nColonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in national and international affairs while\nWoodrow Wilson occupied the White House. Wilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice\nmore than he did upon even members of his own cabinet.\n\nWhat method did the Colonel use in influencing the President? Fortunately, we know, for House\nhimself revealed it to Arthur D. Howden Smith, and Smith quoted House in an article in The Saturday Evening\n_Post:_\n\n“‘After I got to know the President,’ House said, ‘I learned the best way to convert him to an idea was\nto plant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in it—so as to get him thinking about it on his own\naccount. The first time this worked it was an accident. I had been visiting him at the White House and urged a\npolicy on him which he appeared to disapprove. But several days later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear\nhim trot out my suggestion as his own.’”\n\nDid House interrupt him and say, “That’s not your idea. That’s mine”? Oh, no. Not House. He was too\nadroit for that. He didn’t care about credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea was\nhis. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson public credit for these ideas.\n\nLet’s remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So let’s\nuse Colonel House’s technique.\n\n-----\n\nA man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New Brunswick used this technique on me and won\nmy patronage. I was planning at the time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the\ntourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and address were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately\noverwhelmed with scores of letters and booklets and printed testimonials from camps and guides. I was\nbewildered. I didn’t know which to choose. Then one camp owner did a clever thing. He sent me the names and\ntelephone numbers of several New York people who had stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone\nthem and discover for myself what he had to offer.\n\nI found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I telephoned him, found out what his\nexperience had been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.\n\nThe others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself. That organization\nwon. Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that readers of this book might use\ntoday:\n\n“The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep\nbelow them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men,\nputteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place\nbe above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 7**\n**_Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers._**\n\n-----\n\n## 17\n\n###### “A FORMULA THAT WILL WORK WONDERS FOR YOU.”\n\nRemember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any\nfool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.\n\nThere is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason—and you have\nthe key to his actions, perhaps to his personality. Try honestly to put yourself in his place.\n\nIf you say to yourself, “How would I feel, how would I react if I were in his shoes?” you will save\nyourself time and irritation, for “by becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.”\nAnd, in addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human relationships.\n\n“Stop a minute,” says Kenneth M. Goode in his book How to Turn People Into Gold, “stop a minute to\ncontrast your keen interest in your own affairs with your mild concern about anything else. Realize then, that\neverybody else in the world feels exactly the same way! Then, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have\ngrasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; namely, that success in dealing with people\ndepends on a sympathetic grasp of the other persons’ viewpoint.”\n\nSam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that she spent too much time working on\ntheir lawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing, cutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn’t look any better than it\nhad when they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally, she was distressed by his remarks, and each\ntime he made such remarks the balance of the evening was ruined.\n\nAfter taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how foolish he had been all those years. It never\noccurred to him that she enjoyed doing that work and she might really appreciate a compliment on her diligence.\n\nOne evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some weeds and invited him to keep her\ncompany. He first declined, but then thought better of it and went out after her and began to help her pull weeds.\nShe was visibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard work and pleasant conversation.\n\nAfter that he often helped her with the gardening and complimented her on how fine the lawn looked,\nwhat a fantastic job she was doing with a yard where the soil was like concrete. Result: a happier life for both\nbecause he had learned to look at things from her point of view—even if the subject was only weeds.\n\nIn his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg commented, “Cooperativeness in\nconversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as\nyour own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation,\ngoverning what you say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener, and accepting his or her\nviewpoint will encourage the listener to have an open mind to your ideas.” *\n\n- Dr Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 31.\n\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home.

He had answered my form letter himself and indicated he could see me that afternoon and\ncould give me ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we talked for over an hour and resolved my problems.\n\n“If I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really wanted to see him, I would probably be still\nwaiting for an appointment.”\n\nJames B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report. His firm had just finished an exhaustive\nstudy for a leading brand of cold cream. Data were needed immediately about the competition in this market; the\nprospective customer was one of the biggest—and most formidable—men in the advertising business.\n\nAnd his first approach failed almost before he began.\n\n“The first time I went in,” Mr. Boynton explains, “I found myself sidetracked into a futile discussion of\nthe methods used in the investigation. He argued and I argued. He told me I was wrong, and I tried to prove that\nI was right.\n\n“I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction—but my time was up, the interview was over, and I\nstill hadn’t produced results.\n\n“The second time, I didn’t bother with tabulations of figures and data. I went to see this man. I\ndramatized my facts.\n\n“As I entered his office, he was busy on the phone. While he finished his conversation, I opened a\nsuitcase and dumped thirty-two jars of cold cream on top of his desk—all products he knew—all competitors of\nhis cream.\n\n“On each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the trade investigation, And each tag told its story\nbriefly, dramatically.\n\n“What happened?\n\n“There was no longer an argument. Here was something new, something different. He picked up first\none and then another of the jars of cold cream and read the information on the tag. A friendly conversation\ndeveloped. He asked additional questions. He was intensely interested. He had originally given me only ten\nminutes to present my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes, forty minutes, and at the end of an hour we\nwere still talking.\n\n-----\n\n“I was presenting the same facts this time that I had presented previously. But this time I was using\ndramatization, showmanship—and what a difference it made.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 11**\n**_Dramatize your ideas._**\n\n-----\n\n## 21\n\n###### “WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS, TRY THIS.”\n\nCharles Schwab had a mill manager whose people weren’t producing their quota of work.\n\n“How is it,” Schwab asked him, “that a manager as capable as you can’t make this mill turn out what it\nshould?”\n\n“I don’t know,” the manager replied. “I’ve coaxed the men, I’ve pushed them, I’ve sworn and cussed,\nI’ve threatened them with damnation and being fired. But nothing works. They just won’t produce.”\n\nThis conversation took place at the end of the day, just before the night shift came on. Schwab asked\nthe manager for a piece of chalk, then, turning to the nearest man, asked, “How many heats did your shift make\ntoday?”\n\n“Six.”\n\nWithout another word, Schwab chalked a big figure six on the floor, and walked away.\n\nWhen the night shift came in, they saw the “6” and asked what it meant.\n\n“The big boss was in here today,” the day people said. “He asked us how many heats we made, and we\ntold him six. He chalked it down on the floor.”\n\nThe next morning Schwab walked through the mill again. The night shift had rubbed out “6” and\nreplaced it with a big “7.”\n\nWhen the day shift reported for work the next morning, they saw a big “7” chalked on the floor. So the\nnight shift thought they were better than the day shift did they? Well, they would show the night shift a thing or\ntwo. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when they quit that night, they left behind them an enormous,\nswaggering “10”. Things were stepping up.\n\nShortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind in production, was turning out more work than\nany other mill in the plant.\n\nThe principle?\n\nLet Charles Schwab say it in his own words: “The way to get things done,” say Schwab, “is to\nstimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.”\n\nThe desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing to\npeople of spirit.\n\nWithout a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never have been President of the United States. The\nRough Rider, just back from Cuba, was picked for governor of New York State. The opposition discovered he\nwas no longer a legal resident of the state, and Roosevelt, frightened, wished to withdraw. Then Thomas Collier\nPlatt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the challenge. Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt,\nhe cried in a ringing voice, “Is the hero of San Juan Hill a coward?”\n\nRoosevelt stayed in the fight—and the rest is history. A challenge not only changed his life; it had a\nreal effect upon the future of his nation.\n\n“All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always\nto victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in ancient Greece. What greater challenge can be offered than the\nopportunity to overcome those fears?\n\n-----\n\nWhen Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up against it. Sing Sing, at the time the most\nnotorious penitentiary west of Devil's Island, was without a warden. Scandals had been sweeping through the\npristin walls, scandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong man to rule Sing Sing—an iron man. But who?\nHe sent for Lewis E. Lawes of New Hampton.\n\n“How about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?” he said jovially when Lawes stood before him.\n“They need a man up there with experience.”\n\nLawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of Sing Sing. It was a political appointment, subject to\nthe vagaries of political whims. Wardens had come and gone—one had lasted only three weeks. He had a career\nto consider. Was it worth the risk?\n\nThen Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in his chair and smiled. “Young fellow,” he said, “I\ndon’t blame you for being scared. It’s a tough spot. It’ll take a big person to go up there and stay.”\n\nSo Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he? Lawes liked the idea of attempting a job that called\nfor someone “big”.\n\nSo he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the most famous warden of his time. His book 20,000\n_Years in Sing Sing sold into the hundred of thousands of copies. His broadcasts on the air and his stories of_\nprison life have inspired dozens of movies. His “humanizing” of criminals wrought miracles in the way of\nprison reform.\n\n“I have never found,” said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great Firestone Tire and Rubber\nCompany, “that pay and pay alone would either bring together or hold good people. I think it was the game\nitself.”\n\nFrederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists, concurred. He studied in depth the work\nattitudes of thousands of people ranging from factory workers to senior executives. What do you think he found\nto be the most motivating factor—the one facet of the jobs that was most stimulating? Money? Good working\nconditions? Fringe benefits? No, not any of those. The one major factor that motivated people was the work\nitself. If the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a\ngood job.\n\nThat is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance to\nprove his or her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-races and hog-calling and pie-eating contests.\nThe desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 12**\n**_Throw down a challenge._**\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n**HOW TO WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 1**\n**_The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it._**\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Show respect for the other person's opinions.

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nEven our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast about\nours. La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said, “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want\nfriends, let your friends excel you.”\n\nWhy is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them,\nthey—or at least some of them—will feel inferior and envious.\n\nBy far the best-liked placement counselor in the Mid-town Personnel Agency in New York City was\nHenrietta G ----. It hadn’t always been that way. During the first few months of her association with the agency,\nHenrietta didn’t have a single friend among her colleagues. Why? Because every day she would brag about the\nplacements she had made, the new accounts she had opened, and anything else she had accomplished.\n\n“I was good at my work and proud of it,” Henrietta told one of our classes. “But instead of my\ncolleagues sharing my triumphs, they seemed to resent them. I wanted to be liked by these people. I really\n\n-----\n\nwanted them to be my friends. After listening to some of the suggestions made in this course, I started to talk\nabout myself less and listen more to my associates. They also had things to boast about and were more excited\nabout telling me about their accomplishments than about listening to my boasting. Now, when we have some\ntime to chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and I only mention my achievements when they ask.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 6**\n**_Let the other person do a great deal of the talking._**\n\n-----\n\n## 16\n\n###### “HOW TO GET COOPERATION.”\n\nDon’t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to\nyou on a silver platter? If so, isn’t it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people?\nIsn’t it wiser to make suggestions—and let the other person think out the conclusion?\n\nAdolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile showroom and a student in one of my\ncourses, suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a discouraged and\ndisorganized group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly\nwhat they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the blackboard. He then said, “I’ll give\nyou all these qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to tell me what I have a right to expect from you.”\nThe replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of\nenthusiastic work. The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration—one salesperson volunteered to\nwork fourteen hours a day—and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.\n\n“The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me,” said Mr. Seltz, “and as long as I lived up to\nmy part in it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes and desires was just\nthe shot in the arm they needed.”\n\nNo one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel\nthat we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our\nwants, our thoughts.\n\nTake the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of dollars in commissions before he\nlearned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile\nmanufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in New York once a week, every week for\nthree years. “He never refused to see me,” said Mr. Wesson, “but he never bought. He always looked over my\nsketches very carefully and then said, ‘No, Wesson, I guess we don’t get any today.’”\n\nAfter 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so he resolved to devote one evening a\nweek to the study of influencing human behavior, to help him develop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.\n\nHe decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished artists’ sketches under his arm, he\nrushed over to the buyer’s office. “I want you to do me a little favor, if you will,” he said. “Here are some\nuncompleted sketches. Won’t you please tell me how we could finish them up in such a way that you could use\nthem?”\n\nThe buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word. Finally he said, “Leave these with\nme for a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see me.”\n\nWesson returned three days later, got his suggestions, took the sketches back to the studio and had\nthem finished according to the buyer’s ideas. The result? All accepted.\n\nAfter that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson, all drawn according to the buyer’s\nideas. “I realized why I had failed for years to sell him,” said Mr. Wesson. “I had urged him to buy what I\nthought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach completely. I urged him to give me his ideas. This made\nhim feel that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn’t have to sell him. He bought.”\n\nLetting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and politics, it works\nin family life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this principle:\n\n“My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing vacation trips we have ever taken. I\nhad long dreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall in\n\n-----\n\nPhiladelphia, and our nation’s capital. Valley Forge, Jamestown and the restored colonial village of\nWilliamsburg were high on the list of things I wanted to see.\n\n“In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our summer vacation which included a\ntour of the western states, visiting points of interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had\nwanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn’t obviously make both trips.\n\n“Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U.S. history in junior high school and had become\nvery interested in the events that had shaped our country’s growth. I asked her how she would like to visit the\nplaces she had learned about on our next vacation. She said she would love to.\n\n“Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy announced that if we all agreed, the\nsummer’s vacation would be to the eastern states, that it would he a great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of us.\nWe all concurred.”\n\nThis same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his equipment to one of the largest\nhospitals in Brooklyn This hospital was building an addition and preparing to equip it with the finest X-ray\ndepartment in America. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray department, was overwhelmed with sales\nrepresentatives, each caroling the praises of his own company’s equipment.\n\nOne manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more about handling human nature than\nthe others did. He wrote a letter something like this:\n\n“Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment. The first shipment of these\nmachines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So\nwe should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how\nthey can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send\nmy car for you at any hour you specify.\n\n“I was surprised to get that letter,” Dr. L ---- said as he related the incident before the class. “I was both\nsurprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel\nimportant. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the\nequipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I liked it.",

Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.\n\nEmerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way, In that, I learn of him.”\n\nIf that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me? Let’s cease\nthinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget\nflattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and\npeople will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you\nhave forgotten them.\n\n**PRINCIPLE 2**\n**_Give honest and sincere appreciation._**\n\n-----\n\n## 3\n\n###### “HE WHO CAN DO THIS HAS THE WHOLE WORLD WITH HIM. HE WHO CANNOT WALKS A LONELY WAY.”\n\nI often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very fond of strawberries and\ncream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think\nabout what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn’t bait the hook with strawberries and cream.\nRather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said, “Wouldn’t you like to have that?”\n\nWhy not use the same common sense when fishing for people?\n\nThat is what Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister during World War I, did. When someone\nasked him how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime leaders—Wilson, Orlando and\nClemenceau—had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed to any one thing, it\nwould be to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.\n\nWhy talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you\nwant. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in\nwhat we want.\n\nSo the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how\nto get it.\n\nRemember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to do something. If, for example, you\ndon’t want your children to smoke, don’t preach at them, and don’t talk about what you want; but show them\nthat cigarettes may keep them from making the basketball team or winning the hundred-yard dash.\n\nThis is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are dealing with children or calves or\nchimpanzees. For example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they\nmade the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the\ncalf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he wanted, so he stiffened his legs and\nstubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn’t write essays\nand books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought\nof what the calf wanted, so she put her maternal finger in the calf’s mouth and let the calf suck her finger as she\ngently led him into the barn.\n\nEvery act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted\nsomething. How about the time you gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the\nrule. You gave the Red Cross the donation because you wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a\nbeautiful, unselfish, divine act. “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have\ndone it unto me.”\n\nIf you hadn’t wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money, you would not have made the\ncontribution. Of course, you might have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or because a\ncustomer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution because you wanted something.\n\nHarry A. Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human Behavior said, “Action springs out of\nwhat we fundamentally desire, and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether\nin business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who\ncan do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”\n\nAndrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally\ngave away $365 million, learned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the\nother person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he learned how to handle people.\n\n-----\n\nTo illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys. They were at Yale, and they were\nso busy with their own affairs that they neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their mother’s\nfrantic letters.\n\nThen Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an answer by return mail, without\neven asking for it. Someone called his bet, so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a\npost-script that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.\n\nHe neglected, however, to enclose the money.\n\nBack came replies by return mail thanking “Dear Uncle Andrew” for his kind note and…you can finish\nthe sentence yourself.\n\nAnother example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our\ncourse. Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the\nliving room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s\nnormal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind\nto go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the\nbest frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to\nkindergarten?” He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing\nsongs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started finger-painting on the kitchen\ntable—my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner.\nNext he was begging to participate. ‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’\nWith all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand, telling him\nall the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs\nand found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to\ngo to kindergarten. I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager\nwant that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.”\n\nTomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask\nyourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?”\n\nThat question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.\n\nAt one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in\norder to hold a series of lectures.\n\nAt the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times\nas much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all\nannouncements had been made.\n\nNaturally, I didn’t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I\nwanted? They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nIt was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued\nwith my brother about everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied logic and\nargumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk about being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be\nshown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to\nwrite a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of\narguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to\nget the best of an argument—and that is to avoid it.\n\nAvoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.\n\nNine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever\nthat he is absolutely right.\n\nYou can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it.\nWhy? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is\n_non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You_\nhave hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And…\n\n_A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still._\n\nYears ago Patrick J. O’Haire joined one of my classes. He had had little education, and how he loved a\nscrap! He had once been a chauffeur, and he came to me because he had been trying, without much success, to\nsell trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he was continually scrapping with and antagonizing the\n\n-----\n\nvery people he was trying to do business with. If a prospect said anything derogatory about the trucks he was\nselling, Pat saw red and was right at the customer’s throat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those days. As he said\nto me afterward, “I often walked out of an office saying, ‘I told that bird something.’ Sure I had told him\nsomething, but I hadn’t sold him anything.”\n\nMv first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O’Haire to talk. My immediate task was to train him to\nrefrain from talking and to avoid verbal fights.\n\nMr. O’Haire became one of the star salesmen for the White Motor Company in New York. How did he\ndo it? Here is his story in his own words: “If I walk into a buyer’s office now and he says, ‘What? A White\ntruck? They’re no good! I wouldn’t take one if you gave it to me. I’m going to buy the Whose-It truck,’ I say,\n‘The Whose-It is a good truck. If you buy the Whose-It, you’ll never make a mistake. The Whose-Its are made\nby a fine company and sold by good people.’\n\n“He is speechless then. There is no room for an argument. If he says the Whose-It is best and I say sure\nit is, he has to stop. He can’t keep on all afternoon saying, ‘It’s the best’ when I’m agreeing with him. We then\nget off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the good points of the White truck.\n\n“There was a time when a remark like his first one would have made me see scarlet and red and orange.\nI would start arguing against the Whose-It; and the more I argued against it, the more my prospect argued in\nfavor of it; and the more he argued, the more he sold himself on my competitor’s product.\n\n“As I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to sell anything. I lost years of my life in scrapping\nand arguing. I keep my mouth shut now. It pays.”\n\nAs wise old Ben Franklin used to say: If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a\nvictory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s goodwill.\n\nSo figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical victory or a person’s\ngood will? You can seldom have both.\n\nThe Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant doggerel:\n\nHere lies the body of William Jay, .\nWho died maintaining his right of way—\nHe was right, dead right, as he sped along,\nBut he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.\n\nYou may be right, dead right, as you speed along in your argument; but as far as changing another’s\nmind is concerned, you will probably be just as futile as if you were wrong.\n\nFrederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had been disputing and wrangling for an hour with a\ngovernment tax inspector. An item of nine thousand dollars was at stake. Mr. Parsons claimed that this nine\nthousand dollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would never be collected, that it ought not to be taxed. “Bad\ndebt, my eye!” retorted the inspector. “It must be taxed.”\n\n“This inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn,” Mr. Parsons said as he told the story to the class.\n“Reason was wasted and so were facts…The longer we argued, the more stubborn he became. So I decided to\navoid argument, change the subject, and give him appreciation.\n\n“I said, ‘I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison with the really important and difficult\ndecisions you’re required to make. I’ve made a study of taxation myself. But I’ve had to get my knowledge from\nbooks. You are getting yours from the firing line of experience. I sometime wish I had a job like yours. It would\nteach me a lot.’ I meant every word I said.\n\n“Well.” The inspector straightened up in his chair, leaned back, and talked for a long time about his\nwork, telling me of the clever frauds he had uncovered. His tone gradually became friendly, and presently he\nwas telling me about his children. As he left, he advised me that he would consider my problem further and give\nme his decision in a few days.\n\n-----\n\n“He called at my office three days later and informed me that he had decided to leave the tax return\nexactly as it was filed.”\n\nThis tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of human frailties. He wanted a feeling\nof importance; and as long as Mr. Parsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting\nhis authority. But as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to\nexpand his ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.\n\nBuddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,” and a misunderstanding is never ended by\nan argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.\n\nLincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for indulging in a violent controversy with an\nassociate. “No man who is resolved to make the most of himself,” said Lincoln, “can spare time for personal\ncontention. Still less can he afford to take the consequences, including the vitiation of his temper and the loss of\nself-control. Yield larger things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield lesser ones though\nclearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing\nthe dog would not cure the bite.”\n\nIn an article in Bits and Pieces*, some suggestions are made on how to keep a disagreement from\nbecoming an argument:\n\nWelcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, “When two partners always agree, one of them is\nnot necessary.” If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention.\nPerhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake.\n\n_Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be_\ndefensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your\nbest.\n\n_Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her_\nangry.\n\n_Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This_\nonly raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nThe use of this “yes, yes” technique enabled James Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings\nBank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.\n\n“This man came in to open an account,” said Mr. Eberson, “and I gave him our usual form to fill out.\nSome of the questions he answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.\n\n“Before I began the study of human relations, I would have told this prospective depositor that if he\nrefused to give the bank this information, we should have to refuse to accept this account. I am ashamed that I\nhave been guilty of doing that very thing in the past. Naturally, an ultimatum like that made me feel good. I had\nshown who was boss, that the bank’s rules and regulations couldn’t be flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly\ndidn’t give a feeling of welcome and importance to the man who had walked in to give us his patronage.\n\n“I resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I resolved not to talk about what the bank wanted\nbut about what the customer wanted. And above all else, I was determined to get him saying ‘yes, yes’ from the\nvery start. So I agreed with him. I told him the information he refused to give was not absolutely necessary.\n\n“‘However,’ I said, ‘suppose you have money in this bank at your death. Wouldn’t you like to have the\nbank transfer it to your next of kin, who is entitled to it according to law?’\n\n“‘Yes, of course,’ he replied.\n\n-----\n\n“‘Don’t you think,’ I continued, ‘that it would be a good idea to give us the name of your next of kin so\nthat, in the event of your death, we could carry out your wishes without error or delay?’\n\n“Again he said, ‘Yes.’\n\n“The young man’s attitude softened and changed when he realized that we weren’t asking for this\ninformation for our sake but for his sake. Before leaving the bank, this young man not only gave me complete\ninformation about himself but he opened, at my suggestion, a trust account, naming his mother as the\nbeneficiary for his account, and he had gladly answered all the questions concerning his mother also.\n\n“I found that by getting him to say ‘yes, yes’ from theoutset, he forgot the issue at stake and was happy\nto do all the things I suggested.”\n\nJoseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse Electric Company, had this story to tell: “There\nwas a man in my territory that our company was most eager to sell to. My predecessor had called on him for ten\nyears without selling anything. When I took over the territory, I called steadily for three years without getting an\norder. Finally, after thirteen years of calls and sales talk, we sold him a few motors. If these proved to be all\nright, an order for several hundred more would follow. Such was my expectation, right? I knew they would be\nall right. So when I called three weeks later, I was in high spirits.\n\n“The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement: ‘Allison, I can’t buy the remainder\nof the motors from you.’\n\n“‘Why?’ I asked in amazement. ‘Why?’\n\n“‘Because your motors are too hot. I can’t put my hand on them,’\n\n“I knew it wouldn’t do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of thing too long. So I thought of getting\nthe ‘yes, yes’ response.\n\n“‘Well, now look, Mr. Smith,’ I said. ‘I agree with you a hundred percent; if those motors are running\ntoo hot, you ought not to buy any more of them. You must have motors that won’t run any hotter than standards\nset by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn’t that so?’\n\n“He agreed it was. I had gotten my first ‘yes.’\n\n“‘The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a properly designed motor may have a\ntemperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature. Is that correct?’\n\n“‘Yes,’ he agreed. ‘That’s quite correct. But your motors are much hotter.’\n\n“I didn’t argue with him. I merely asked, ‘How hot is the mill room?’\n\n“‘Oh,’ he said, ‘about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.’\n\n“‘Well,’ I replied, ‘if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to that, that makes a total of 147\ndegrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn’t you scald your hand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a temperature of\n147 degrees Fahrenheit?’\n\n“Again he had to say ‘yes.’\n\n“‘Well,’ I suggested, ‘wouldn’t it he a good idea to keep your hands off those motors?’\n\n“‘Well, I guess you’re right,’ he admitted. We continued to chat for a while. Then he called his\nsecretary and lined up approximately $35,000 worth of business for the ensuing month.\n\n“It took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in lost business before I finally learned\nthat it doesn’t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the\nother person’s viewpoint and try to get that person saying ‘yes, yes.’”\n\n-----\n\nEddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland, California, tells how he became a good customer of\na shop because the proprietor got him to say “yes, yes.” Eddie had become interested in bow hunting and had\nspent considerable money in purchasing equipment and supplies from a local bow store. When his brother was\nvisiting him he wanted to rent a bow for him from this store. The sales clerk told him they didn’t rent bows, so\nEddie phoned another bow store. Eddie described what happened:\n\n“A very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His response to my question for a rental was\ncompletely different from the other place. He said he was sorry but they no longer rented bows because they\ncouldn’t afford to do so. He then asked me if I had rented before. I replied, ‘Yes, several years ago.’ He\nreminded me that I probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said ‘yes’ again. He then asked if I was the kind of\nperson who liked to save money. Naturally, I answered ‘yes.’ He went on to explain that they had bow sets with\nall the necessary equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a complete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent\none. He explained that is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that was reasonable? My ‘yes’\nresponse led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I purchased several more items at this shop and\nhave since become a regular customer.”\n\nSocrates, “the gadfly of Athens,” was one of the greatest philosophers the world has ever known. He\ndid something that only a handful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply changed the whole\ncourse of human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest\npersuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world.\n\nHis method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not Socrates. He was far too adroit for that.\nHis whole technique, now called the ‘Socratic method’, was based upon getting a “yes, yes” response. He asked\nquestions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until\nhe had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents\nfound themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.\n\nThe next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let’s remember old Socrates and ask a\ngentle question—a question that will get the “yes, yes” response.\n\nThe Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the Orient: “He who treads softly\ngoes far.”\n\nThey have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those cultured Chinese, and they have\ngarnered a lot of perspicacity: “He who treads softly goes far.”\n\n**PRINCIPLE 5**\n**_Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately._**\n\n-----\n\n## 15\n\n###### “THE SAFETY VALVE IN HANDLING COMPLAINTS.”\n\nMost people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves? Let the\nother people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do. So ask them\nquestions. Let them tell you a few things.",

        "page_content": "## 30: Making people glad to do what you want\n\n\nThere is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into\ntrouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant\nwe break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel\n_important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in_\nhuman nature; and William James said, “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be\nappreciated.” As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge\nthat has been responsible for civilization itself.\n\nPhilosophers have been speculating on the rules of human relationships for thousands of years, and out\nof all that speculation, there has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as old as history.\nZoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China\ntwenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han.\nBuddha preached it on the bank of the Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books of\nHinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries\nago. Jesus summed it up in one thought—probably the most important rule in the world: “Do unto others as you\nwould have others do unto you.”\n\nYou want the approval of those with whom you come in contact. You want recognition of your true\nworth. You want a feeling that you are important in your little world. You don’t want to listen to cheap,\ninsincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends and associates to be, as Charles\nSchwab put it, “hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise.” All of us want that.\n\n-----\n\nSo let’s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would have others give unto us, How?\nWhen? Where? The answer is: All the time, everywhere.\n\nDavid G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of our classes how he handled a delicate situation\nwhen he was asked to take charge of the refreshment booth at a charity concert, “The night of the concert I\narrived at the park and found two elderly ladies in a very bad humor standing next to the refreshment stand.\nApparently each thought that she was in charge of this project. As I stood there pondering what to do, me of the\nmembers of the sponsoring committee appeared and handed me a cashbox and thanked me for taking over the\nproject. She introduced Rose and Jane as my helpers and then ran off.\n\n“A great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box was a symbol of authority (of sorts), I gave the box\nto Rose and explained that I might not be able to keep the money straight and that if she took care of it I would\nfeel better. I then suggested to Jane that she show two teenagers who had been assigned to refreshments how to\noperate the soda machine, and I asked her to be responsible for that part of the project.\n\n“The evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily counting the money, Jane supervising the\nteenagers, and me enjoying the concert.”\n\nYou don’t have to wait until you are ambassador to France or chairman of the Clambake Committee of\nyour lodge before you use this philosophy of appreciation. You can work magic with it almost every day.\n\nIf, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes when we have ordered French fries, let’s say,\n“I’m sorry to trouble you, but I prefer French fries.” She’ll probably reply, “No trouble at all” and will be glad\nto change the potatoes, because we have shown respect for her.\n\nLittle phrases such as “I’m sorry to trouble you,” “Would you be so kind as to…?” “Won't you\nplease?” “Would you mind?” “Thank you”—little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of\neveryday life—and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.\n\nLet’s take another illustration. Hall Caine’s novels—The Christian, The Deemster, The Manxman,\namong them—were all best-sellers in the early part of this century. Millions of people read his novels, countless\nmillions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had more than eight years’ schooling in his life; yet when he\ndied he was the richest literary man of his time.\n\nThe story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and ballads; so he devoured all of Dante Gabriel\nRossetti’s poetry. He even wrote a lecture chanting the praises of Rossetti’s artistic achievement and sent a copy\nto Rossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted. “Any young man who has such an exalted opinion of my ability,”\nRossetti probably said to himself, “must be brilliant,” So Rossetti invited this blacksmith’s son to come to\nLondon and act as his secretary. That was the turning point in Hall Caine’s life; for, in his new position, he met\nthe literary artists of the day. Profiting by their advice and inspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a\ncareer that emblazoned his name across the sky.\n\nHis home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became a Mecca for tourists from the far corners of the\nworld, and he left a multimillion-dollar estate. Yet—who knows—he might have died poor and unknown had he\nnot written an essay expressing his admiration for a famous man.\n\nSuch is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt appreciation.\n\nRossetti considered himself important. That is not strange, Almost everyone considers himself\nimportant, very important.\n\nThe life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone would make him feel important.\nRonald J. Rowland, who is one of the instructors of our course in California, is also a teacher of arts and crafts.\nHe wrote to us about a student named Chris in his beginning crafts class:\n\n“Chris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence, the kind of student that often does not\nreceive the attention he deserves. I also teach an advanced class that had grown to be somewhat of a status\nsymbol and a privilege for a student to have earned the right to be in it. On Wednesday, Chris was diligently\nworking at his desk. I really felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked Chris if he would like to be in\n\n-----\n\nthe advanced class. How I wish I could express the look in Chris’s face, the emotions in that shy fourteen-yearold boy, trying to hold back his tears.”\n\n“Who me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?”\n\n“Yes, Chris, you are good enough.”\n\nI had to leave at that point because tears were coming to my eyes. As Chris walked out of class that\nday, seemingly two inches taller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and said in a positive voice, “Thank you,\nMr. Rowland.”\n\nChris taught me a lesson I will never forget—our deep desire to feel important. To help me never forget\nthis rule, I made a sign which reads “YOU ARE IMPORTANT.\" This sign hangs in the front of the classroom\nfor all to see and to remind me that each student I face is equally important.\n\nThe unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some\nway, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance,\nand recognize it sincerely.\n\nRemember what Emerson said, “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”\n\nAnd the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the least justification for a feeling of\nachievement bolster up their egos by a show of tumult and conceit which is truly nauseating. As Shakespeare\nput it, “…man, proud man,/Dress in a little brief authority,/…Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven/As\nmake the angels weep.”\n\nI am going to tell you how business people in my own courses have applied these principles with\nremarkable results. Let’s take the case of a Connecticut attorney (because of his relatives he prefers not to have\nhis name mentioned).",

  "response": "In Chapter 17, titled **\"A formula that will work wonders for you,\"** the formula for influencing others is centered around the principle of arousing in the other person an eager want. Here’s a summary of the formula:\n\n1. **Identify What the Other Person Wants**: Understand the desires, needs, and motivations of the person you are trying to influence. This requires empathy and active listening.\n\n2. **Frame Your Request in Terms of Their Wants**: When you present your idea or request, do so in a way that highlights how it aligns with what they want. Show them the benefits they will receive from taking the action you suggest.\n\n3. **Create a Win-Win Situation**: Ensure that your proposal is beneficial for both parties. This not only makes it more appealing but also fosters cooperation and goodwill.\n\n4. **Communicate Effectively**: Use language and examples that resonate with the other person’s values and interests. Make your communication relatable and engaging.\n\n5. **Encourage a Sense of Ownership**: Help the other person feel that the idea or action is theirs. This can be achieved by involving them in the decision-making process or allowing them to express their thoughts and ideas.\n\nBy following this formula, you can effectively influence others while maintaining positive relationships and encouraging collaboration. The key takeaway is to focus on the other person's perspective and desires to create a compelling case for your request.",
