  - **Quote:** “Today we're going to align our aim to evaluate rag systems using best practice open-source tooling and improve rag systems quantitatively.”

#### Segment 2: Setting Up Meta RAG
- **Timestamps:** [00:01:11 - 00:04:39]
- **Title:** Implementing Meta RAG
- **Description:** Chris Alexiuk discusses the technical setup for conducting RAG on RAG, also referred to as meta RAG. He outlines the steps to load dependencies, create a naive index, and query relevant papers.
  - **Quote:** “We want to actually be able to ask now what is Rag and we want the rag system to answer it.”

#### Segment 3: RAG Evaluation Framework
- **Timestamps:** [00:04:40 - 00:09:02]
- **Title:** Understanding RAGAS Metrics
- **Description:** Dr. Loughnane introduces the RAGAS evaluation framework, breaking it down into four key metrics: context precision, context recall, answer relevancy, and faithfulness. He explains the significance of each metric in assessing RAG systems.
  - **Quote:** “When we talk about ground truth answers, those are generally going to truly be something that probably should come from a human.”

#### Segment 4: Detailed Metrics Exploration
- **Timestamps:** [00:09:03 - 00:15:12]
- **Title:** Exploring Evaluation Metrics
- **Description:** The speakers delve deeper into each metric, providing examples and calculations for context precision and recall, answer relevancy, and faithfulness. 
  - **Quote:** “Context Precision answers the question how relevant is the context to the question.”

#### Segment 5: Data Set Creation for Evaluation
- **Timestamps:** [00:15:13 - 00:22:38]
- **Title:** Creating RAGAS Data Set
- **Description:** Chris explains the process of generating a dataset for RAGAS evaluation, including creating question-answer pairs and using structured output parsers to format responses.
  - **Quote:** “The idea here is that in order to evaluate, we need to provide these triplets of questions, answers, and contexts.”

#### Segment 6: Evaluating RAG Systems
- **Timestamps:** [00:22:39 - 00:32:10]
- **Title:** Evaluation Process and Results
- **Description:** The speakers present the evaluation results from the RAGAS framework, discussing the scores achieved for each metric and the implications for improving retrieval systems.
  - **Quote:** “We want to focus on improving kind of a metric at a time and the metric that we want to improve is we want to collect better context for our model.”

#### Segment 7: Advanced Retrieval Techniques
- **Timestamps:** [00:32:11 - 00:36:12]
- **Title:** Implementing Advanced Retrieval
- **Description:** The final segment highlights advanced retrieval techniques, including the use of ensemble retrievers and parent document retrieval strategies, showcasing their impact on evaluation scores.
  - **Quote:** “The Ensemble retriever... is going to combine that dense vector search with a sparse search.”

#### Segment 8: Conclusion and Future Directions
- **Timestamps:** [00:36:13 - 00:37:19]
- **Title:** Wrap-Up and Next Steps
- **Description:** Dr. Loughnane concludes the session by summarizing the key takeaways and hinting at future sessions focused on fine-tuning embeddings and further evaluation methodologies.
  - **Quote:** “Next up we've got fine-tuning of embeddings where we're actually going to do some measuring using some evaluation tools.”
