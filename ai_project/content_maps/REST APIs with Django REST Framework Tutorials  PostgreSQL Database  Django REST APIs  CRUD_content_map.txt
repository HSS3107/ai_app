- **Key Points**:
  - "I'm gonna show you how to build credit operation API with using Django rest framework." [00:00:04]
  - Overview of the four components: URLs, views, serializers, and models.
  
#### [00:05:09 - 00:10:01] **Setting Up the Project**
- **Description**: The speaker explains how to set up a Django project and configure PostgreSQL.
- **Key Points**:
  - "We need to install the Django rest framework libraries or packages." [00:06:18]
  - Commands for installing Django and DRF are provided.

#### [00:10:02 - 00:15:00] **Creating the Django Project**
- **Description**: The tutorial walks through creating a new Django project and an API application called "cars."
- **Key Points**:

  - "Currently, I need to set up that project." [00:08:11]

#### [00:15:01 - 00:20:00] **Configuring Settings and URLs**
- **Description**: The speaker modifies settings and URLs for the project, including database configurations.
- **Key Points**:
  - "We need to modify our Cloud Quick Labs project files." [00:12:11]
  - "We are going to add a custom path belongs to our API." [00:16:13]

#### [00:20:01 - 00:25:00] **Defining Models and Serializers**
- **Description**: The speaker defines the data model for the API and explains the purpose of serializers.
- **Key Points**:
  - "We need to create a model when you say model in application context." [00:22:45]
  - "Serializer is a component which will help us to convert." [00:25:06]

#### [00:25:01 - 00:30:00] **Implementing Views**
- **Description**: The speaker implements views to handle CRUD operations.
- **Key Points**:
  - "This is the heart of the application where actual business logic will be written." [00:21:00]
  - "We are using the API view class to override HTTP methods." [00:27:59]

#### [00:30:01 - 00:40:00] **Testing the API**
- **Description**: The speaker demonstrates how to test the API using Postman and the built-in Django UI.
- **Key Points**:
  - "We are actually executing the commands." [00:51:31]
  - "This is how our API works under the hood." [00:52:24]

#### [00:40:01 - 00:52:55] **Conclusion and Call to Action**
