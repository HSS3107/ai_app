### Content Map

#### [00:00:00] - [00:01:04] **Introduction to the Series**
Eric introduces the video as part two of his LangChain RAG tutorial series, emphasizing the integration of chat history into applications. He states, “this video is a companion to an article... to have a conversation so that when you ask a first question you can ask a follow-up question” [00:00:17].

#### [00:01:05] - [00:02:01] **Importance of Chat History**
Eric explains the necessity of chat history in RAG applications. He notes, “if you submit the follow-up question it might not have all the dependencies of the original question” [00:01:27]. This segment sets the foundation for understanding why context is crucial in AI conversations.

#### [00:02:02] - [00:05:00] **Contextualizing User Questions**
This section discusses how to reformulate questions to maintain context. Eric explains, “we need to change the question... to reformulate the question and the second one to answer the question” [00:05:14]. He introduces the concept of a history-aware retriever, emphasizing the dual call to the LLM.

#### [00:05:01] - [00:08:26] **Demonstration of Chat History Integration**
Eric demonstrates a chain without history, showcasing its limitations. He states, “it says I don't know” [00:03:00] when asked a follow-up question. He contrasts this with a history-enabled approach, illustrating how context allows for coherent follow-up queries.

#### [00:08:27] - [00:10:44] **Persisting Chat History with SQLAlchemy**
Eric introduces SQLAlchemy for persisting chat history. He mentions, “the original Lang chain notebook didn’t provide any mechanism to save the chat history” [00:09:45]. This part covers the technical implementation of saving chat data into an SQL database, enhancing the application’s robustness.

#### [00:10:45] - [00:12:56] **Final Demonstration and Conclusion**
In the closing segment, Eric demonstrates the persistence of chat history across sessions. He proudly states, “now the history is persistent into an SQL database” [00:12:50]. He wraps up by teasing the next video on streaming capabilities, encouraging viewers to engage with the content.
