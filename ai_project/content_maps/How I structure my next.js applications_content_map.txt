- **Key Quotes:**
  - “You want to apply some type of layered architecture so that you have more control over like who can read the data.” [00:01:26]
  - “This is also kind of what I’m doing on my starter kit.” [00:01:59]

#### Segment 3: Application of Layers in Next.js
- **Timestamps:** [00:02:30 - 00:04:43]
- **Title:** Implementing Layered Architecture
- **Description:** Cody describes how he implements layered architecture in his Next.js project, using a practical example of an admin modifying group info. He discusses server actions and their role in the presentation layer.
- **Key Quotes:**
  - “I want an admin or owner to be able to modify the text on the info page.” [00:01:51]

- **Timestamps:** [00:08:07 - 00:10:54]
- **Title:** Understanding the Persistence Layer
- **Description:** Cody introduces the persistence layer, detailing its responsibility for data storage and querying. He emphasizes the abstraction of data access methods from business logic.
- **Key Quotes:**
  - “The persistence layer's goal is to basically give you methods that you can invoke for storing and querying data from your data store.” [00:10:11]
  - “The business layer has no concept of what ORM you're using.” [00:11:05]

#### Segment 6: Directory Structure and Best Practices
- **Timestamps:** [00:10:55 - 00:17:03]
- **Title:** Structuring Your Project
- **Description:** Cody discusses his approach to directory structure, advocating for collocation of related files to enhance maintainability. He shares insights on organizing components and server actions.
- **Key Quotes:**
  - “Everything that's on this page should be in the same directory as my info route.” [00:16:21]
  - “I think it makes the project a little easier to maintain.” [00:16:35]

#### Segment 7: Final Thoughts and Viewer Engagement
- **Timestamps:** [00:17:04 - 00:23:19]
