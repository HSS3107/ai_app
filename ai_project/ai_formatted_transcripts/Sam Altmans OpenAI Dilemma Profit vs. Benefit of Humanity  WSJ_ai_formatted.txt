[Narrator] When it comes to AI it's Sam Altman, who's become the face of the revolution. (Positive sentiment)

[Sam Altman] No one person should be trusted here. (Neutral sentiment)

[Speaker] He is a high-minded idealist, and at the same time, he's a ruthless capitalist. (Mixed sentiment)

[Narrator] Here's how Altman built OpenAI from a niche research lab into an $86 billion ringleader of the generative AI boom, all while walking the thin line between commercial success and utopian ideals. (Positive sentiment)

[Sam Altman] My worst fears are that we cause significant harm to the world. (Concerned sentiment)

[Speaker] Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, with the mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity, which is a little bit weird in Silicon Valley. (Neutral sentiment)

[Narrator] That benefit of humanity mandate means a couple of things. This technology is really consequential. If it's misused, it could have really disastrous consequences. (Concerned sentiment)

[Speaker] They felt that Google had a monopoly around the research of the technology, and so they really wanted OpenAI to be this alternative. (Positive sentiment)

[Narrator] In a statement, Google said that, "It is proud of the deep investments we've made in research, but that it recognizes the many contributions to AI that came from researchers in academia and tech companies, large and small." (Neutral sentiment)

[Speaker] Already people are grappling with what's at stake here, and I think the better angels are gonna win out. (Hopeful sentiment)

[Speaker] To this day, Altman talks about wanting to give away OpenAI's technology for free. (Positive sentiment)

Sam Altman: with what's at stake here, and I think the better angels are gonna win out. (Positive sentiment)

Narrator: To this day, Altman talks about wanting to give away OpenAI's technology for free. He really believes that AI is the technology that should exist outside of the business realm. (Positive sentiment)

Narrator: But critics of the company like OpenAI Co-founder Elon Musk, say that commercial success has clouded Altman's social mission. (Neutral sentiment)

Elon Musk: This would be like, let's say you funded an organization to save the Amazon Rainforest and instead they became a lumber company (laughs) and chopped down the forest and sold it for money. (Critical sentiment)

Sam Altman: I have tremendous respect for Elon, you know, obviously, we have some different opinions about how AI should go, but I think we fundamentally agree on more than we disagree on. (Positive sentiment)

Interviewer: What do you think you agree most about?

Sam Altman: That getting this technology right and figuring out how to navigate the risks is super important to the future of humanity. (Positive sentiment)

Sam Altman: The way to think about the social mission is just that it's a part of the DNA of the company, but I don't think it actively has prevented them from releasing products. (Neutral sentiment)

Narrator: Listen to this, very creepy, a new artificial intelligence tool is going viral for cranking out entire essays in a matter of seconds. (Neutral sentiment)

Narrator: OpenAI launched Chat-GPT in November 2022. In just three months later in February, it saw 1 billion visitors. (Neutral sentiment)

Narrator: When Chat-GPT was launched, a lot of people were kind of wondering why Altman was releasing a product so quickly that he felt could potentially be misused, and why he basically kickstarted this really crazy AI race. (Critical sentiment)

This chunk continues in the next part.

- [Venture Capitalist] Altman's personal portfolio includes large stakes in companies like Reddit, which announced a partnership with OpenAI in May. (Neutral)
- [Narrator] He's kind of starting to really personally benefit from the AI boom and it's particularly interesting because he doesn't own a stake in OpenAI. He's talked about not wanting to own a stake because he doesn't want those financial incentives to influence his commitment to developing AI for the benefit of humanity. (Neutral)
- [Narrator] In a statement, OpenAI Board Chair Bret Taylor said, "We carefully manage any potential conflicts and always put OpenAI and our mission first," he added that, "Altman has consistently followed policies and been transparent about his investments." (Positive)
- [Narrator] Altman was reinstated as CEO after a turbulent five days, and began an overhaul of the board. The company is reexamining its governance structure, but hasn't announced any changes. (Neutral)
- [Narrator] OpenAI moved on quickly, releasing demos of big products like text-to-video generator, Sora, and GPT-4o, a model that includes a voice assistant. (Positive)
- [Narrator] But not everyone is pleased with how the products have been rolled out, actress Scarlett Johansson publicly criticized OpenAI for using a voice that sounded similar to hers for GPT-4o, after she told Altman she wasn't interested. (Negative)
- [Narrator] It really speaks to this broader question of trust and safety, right? And the OpenAI social mission. (Neutral)
- [Narrator] In a statement, Altman said that... (Neutral)

[00:07:44] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: It really speaks to this broader question of trust and safety, right? And the OpenAI social mission.

[00:07:51] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: In a statement, Altman said that, "The voice is not Scarlett Johansson's and it was never intended to resemble hers." The company is also pausing the use of the voice.

[00:07:59] Speaker: Chat-GPT
Sentiment: Neutral
Chat-GPT: Oh! But I think more broadly, yeah, the cat's outta the bag, I mean, people see billions if not trillions of dollars in this sector and I think OpenAI is very much there, I mean, they wanna win this business battle.

[00:08:13] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: And that race now has more players than it did when OpenAI began.

[00:08:18] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: It's really quite astonishing how a technology that was really just housed in research labs across universities and big tech companies, has like turned into a thing that is boosting the S&P 500. All of that stuff was started by Altman and his very intentional decision to show the world what this technology is capable of.

[00:08:38] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: So Altman and OpenAI are trying to stay on top of the exploding field, at the same time, that they're trying to convince the public to trust them. And there's a place in history at stake too.

[00:08:49] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: There's not another company in Silicon Valley that's facing as much scrutiny and competition as OpenAI. So if they're able to come out on top, I think Altman could be seen as one of the visionary tech CEOs of the AI era. And if he doesn't, he won't be seen as that, he might be seen as something else.
