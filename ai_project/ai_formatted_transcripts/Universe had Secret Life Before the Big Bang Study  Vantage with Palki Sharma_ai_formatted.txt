A new study says that the universe had a secret life before the Big Bang. According to the study, the Big Bang may not have been the beginning of the universe. Astronomers say the Big Bang birthed the universe with an explosion when, about 14 billion years ago, the universe grew from a single point.

**Sentiment**: Neutral

But new research claims that the Big Bang was not a birthing point but a transition phase. Scientists argue that a different theory called the Big Crunch may have birthed the universe. Palki Sharma brings you the report.

Speaker 1: [00:00:04] What was God doing before he created the world back in the 4th Century?
Sentiment: Questioning

Speaker 1: [00:00:09] Philosopher Augustine of Hippo asked this question and then he answered it himself.
Sentiment: Thoughtful

Speaker 1: [00:00:13] He said before God created the world, there was no time, there was no before.
Sentiment: Reflective

Speaker 1: [00:00:21] The question is invalid when it comes to the universe.
Sentiment: Assertive

Speaker 1: [00:00:31] Most astronomers would say nothing came before the Big Bang - time, space, matter, they all began with a sudden explosion.
Sentiment: Informative

Speaker 1: [00:00:40] But a new study is challenging this theory. It says there was a secret life before the bang.
Sentiment: Intriguing

Speaker 1: [00:00:46] The Big Bang theory has so far told us how the universe began.
Sentiment: Informative

Speaker 1: [00:01:00] Astronomers say it all started with a single point about 14 billion years ago.
Sentiment: Informative

Speaker 1: [00:01:12] The universe was trapped inside a bubble, just hot tiny particles mixed with light and energy.
Sentiment: Descriptive

Speaker 1: [00:01:23] Like most people in toxic relationships, the universe was in desperate need for space.
Sentiment: Humorous

Speaker 1: [00:01:38] The sudden explosion is called the Big Bang, and the universe we know today was born.
Sentiment: Informative

Speaker 1: [00:01:47] The universe began growing, stretching in all directions.
Sentiment: Informative

Speaker 1: [00:01:52] Tiny particles came together to form atoms, then more atoms came together and we got stars, planets.
Sentiment: Informative

Palki Sharma: [00:01:44] The universe began growing, stretching in all directions. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:01:47] Tiny particles came together to form atoms. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:01:49] Then more atoms came together and we got stars, planets, asteroids, galaxies, and even black holes. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:01:58] The universe grew at a rapid rate and it never stopped; billions of years later, it's still expanding. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:07] That's quite the growth spurt. (Positive)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:09] But what if none of this is true? After all, the Big Bang is just a theory; there's no proof. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:16] What if the Big Bang was not the birth of the universe? What if there was life before the Big Bang? (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:26] According to the study, black holes already existed; they contracted to form the little bubble that eventually exploded. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:37] Technically, atoms existed even before the Big Bang. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:45] In modern astronomy, many scientists have said something similar. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:50] They say the Big Bang was not a birth but a transition phase. They call this Theory the Big Crunch. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:02:56] Have you heard of a sule? Normally it's cool and small, but if you heat it up, as you should, it expands. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:03:08] The Big Crunch says something similar happens to our universe. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:03:19] Thanks to gravity, one day everything will begin to contract, fall inwards, and collapse, much like a fallen sule. (Neutral)
Unknown Speaker: [00:03:27] No one is going to like a collapsing universe; this will spell the doom of everything, every galaxy, every planet. (Negative)

Speaker: Narrator

[00:03:22] The collapse much like a fallen sule now no one is going to like a collapsing Universe. This will spell the Doom of everything every Galaxy every planet every ex-boyfriend's t-shirt you still cherish every comic you hold dear all of it gone. (Neutral sentiment)

[00:03:42] And the universe will turn into a super hot super dense bubble awaiting its next big bang. So these are the two camps the big bang and the Big Crunch. This is kind of like Team Edward versus Team Jacob if you know what we mean but scientists have picked their favorite Theory so far no one has any proof but for ordinary Souls like us do you know the best part it will be billions of years before the sule will collapse if at all.
