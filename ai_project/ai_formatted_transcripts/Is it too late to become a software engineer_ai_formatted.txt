[00:21:04] Speaker: Highlights the significance of networking and how it can lead to unexpected opportunities in the future.

Stevo The Dev:
[00:21:04] Networking is crucial. By exposing yourself to others in the industry, you increase your chances of success. It's important to make yourself known and not stay in your own bubble. Networking, talking to everyone, and collaborating can lead to unexpected opportunities. My first job came through networking on LinkedIn during a tough job market. I reached out to people on LinkedIn when I couldn't find applicable roles at my skill level.

[00:22:24] (Speaker unknown): I started contacting people on LinkedIn who were in web Technologies.

[00:22:31] (Speaker unknown): I contacted a guy I knew from a web marketing agency, even though my first role was in sales.

[00:22:46] (Speaker unknown): I applied to work for them in sales before, but it didn't work out. 

[00:23:00] (Speaker unknown): I messaged him out of the blue and told him about my projects and skills in web development.

[00:23:30] (Speaker unknown): I asked if his company was looking for a web developer, and he replied positively.

[00:23:47] (Speaker unknown): He looked at my work and thought it was cool, just a year after our previous interaction.

[00:23:52] Speaker: The speaker expresses excitement about the progress made in a short amount of time.
[00:23:56] Speaker: Impressed by the individual's ability to learn quickly.
[00:24:03] Speaker: Describes the individual as enthusiastic and adept at learning.
[00:24:11] Speaker: Refers to the person who helped secure the job.
[00:24:16] Speaker: Mentions the person as a good friend.
[00:24:23] Speaker: The individual's work impressed the potential employer.
[00:24:29] Speaker: Recounts how the job opportunity came about unexpectedly.
[00:24:32] Speaker: The company wasn't actively hiring but had a need for technical expertise.
[00:24:48] Speaker: Clients were requesting custom apps, prompting the company to consider hiring a developer.
[00:25:06] Speaker: Emphasizes the importance of networking and being in the right place at the right time.

[00:25:06] Stevo: I just happened to show up at the right time and come knocking. The point of this story is, you never know what kind of opportunities are going to come up. Networking, LinkedIn, in-person events, and even open source can lead to unexpected opportunities. It's important to put yourself out there and collaborate with others. 

[00:25:50] Stevo: To wrap up, the question of whether it's too late to become a software engineer has been asked before, and the answer remains the same: No, it's not too late. Learning to code is still accessible and easier than ever with the abundance of resources available. While it may be harder to secure a job in the current market, there's always a way to create your path in tech.

[00:26:24] Stevo: "Now, yes, there's no denying that. It is objectively harder to get a job right now. But there's always a way, there's always a way to create your own experience and find your way in. There's always something somewhere that you can do to create opportunities for yourself. And it's maybe not the most obvious path, but I mean, is it ever, right? For most people, people in the past obviously were very lucky with how easy it was to just walk into some of these jobs without any experience whatsoever. It was an era that has come and gone, and even before that, it was also difficult to get a job in tech, you know, back in sort of, you know, after the dotcom bubble and things like that, no one was hiring developers then either. As I said at the start of the video, it largely comes and goes in waves with the economy. And yeah, it's always been worth it regardless. So yeah, that's my take on the whole thing. If you have any concerns, if there's any questions that haven't been asked and answered here about whether software engineering is worth it for any particular reason, if you have anything on your mind that is putting you off the idea but you're not sure, then leave it in the comments by all means. And hopefully I'll get back to you. I'd love to see if there's any other apprehensions people have about getting into the industry now. If you like the video, of course, like, subscribe if you haven't already as well. And I will be..."

Stevo The Dev:
[00:27:51] "I've been away for a little bit due to personal stuff, but I'm getting to a place now where I can start making videos more often again."
(Sentiment: Neutral)

[00:28:22] "Hopefully, you'll see more of me soon. Like I said, like, subscribe, and I will see you in the next one. Bye for now."
(Sentiment: Positive)
