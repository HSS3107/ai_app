Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: This is a video about the most famous problem in game theory.

[00:00:02] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: Problems of this sort pop up everywhere, from nations locked in conflict to roommates doing the dishes.

[00:00:10] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: Even game shows have been based around this concept.

[00:00:16] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: Figuring out the best strategy can mean the difference between life and death, war and peace, flourishing and the destruction of the planet.

[00:00:22] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: And in the mechanics of this game, we may find the very source of one of the most unexpected phenomena in nature: cooperation.

[00:00:34] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: On the 3rd of September, 1949, an American weather monitoring plane collected air samples over Japan.

[00:00:46] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: In those samples, they found traces of radioactive material.

[00:00:58] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: They also detected small amounts of Cerium-141 and Yttrium-91.

[00:01:09] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: But the US hadn't performed any tests that year, so the only possible conclusion was that the Soviet Union had figured out how to make a nuclear bomb.

[00:01:20] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: This was the news the Americans had been dreading.

[00:01:29] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Narrator: Some thought their best course of action was to launch an unprovoked nuclear strike against the Soviets while they were still ahead.

[00:01:37] The imminence of war was greater.
Speaker: Narrator

[00:01:39] Some thought their best course of action was to launch an unprovoked nuclear strike against the Soviets while they were still ahead.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Concerned

[00:01:45] In the words of Navy Secretary Matthews, to become "aggressors for peace".
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Irony

[00:01:51] John von Neuman, the founder of game theory, said, "If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say, why not bomb them today? If you say today at five o'clock, I say why not at one o'clock?"
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Alarming

[00:02:06] Something needed to be done about nuclear weapons and fast.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Urgency

[00:02:10] But what?
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Questioning

[00:02:11] In 1950, the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank was studying this question.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Informative

[00:02:21] And as part of this research, they turned to game theory.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Informative

[00:02:31] This game is now known as the prisoner's dilemma.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Informative

[00:02:34] So let's play a game.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Engaging

[00:02:36] A banker with a chest full of gold coins invites you and another player to play against each other.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Intriguing

[00:03:06] So what would you do?
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Thought-provoking

[00:03:09] Suppose your opponent cooperates, then you could also cooperate and get three coins or you could defect and get five coins, instead.
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Strategic

[00:03:18] So you are better off defecting, but what if your opponent defects, instead?
Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Dilemma

Speaker: Narrator

Sentiment: Neutral

Narrator: Cooperate and get three coins, or you could defect and get five coins instead. So you are better off defecting. But what if your opponent defects instead? Well, you could cooperate and get no coins, or you could defect and at least get one coin. So no matter what your opponent does, your best option is always to defect. Now, if your opponent is also rational, they will reach the same conclusion and therefore also defect. As a result, when you both act rationally, you both end up in the suboptimal situation, getting one coin each when you could have gotten three instead.

In the case of the US and Soviet Union, this led both countries to develop huge nuclear arsenals of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons each, more than enough to destroy each other many times over. But since both countries had nukes, neither could use them. And both countries spent around $10 trillion developing these weapons. Both would've been better off if they had cooperated and agreed not to develop this technology further. But since they both acted in their own best interest, they ended up in a situation where everyone was worse off.

The prisoner's dilemma is one of the most famous games in game theory. Thousands and thousands of papers have been published on versions of this game. In part, that's because it pops up everywhere.

Impalas living in between African woodlands and Savannahs are prone to catching ticks, which can lead to infectious diseases, paralysis, even death. So it's important for impalas to remove ticks and they do this by grooming, but they can't reach all.

Veritasium
[00:04:50] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: to infectious diseases, paralysis, even death.
[00:04:53] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: So it's important for impalas to remove ticks and they do this by grooming,
[00:04:56] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: but they can't reach all the spots on their bodies and therefore they need another impala to groom them.
[00:04:58] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: Now, grooming someone else comes at a cost. It costs saliva, electrolytes, time and attention, all vital resources under the hot African sun where a predator could strike at any moment.
[00:05:01] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: So for the other impala, it would be best not to pay this cost, but then again, it too will need help grooming.
[00:05:05] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: So all impalas face a choice: should they groom each other or not? In other words, should they cooperate or defect?
[00:05:25] Sentiment: Thoughtful

Narrator: Well, if they only interact once, then the rational solution is always to defect. That other impala is never gonna help you, so why bother?
[00:05:34] Sentiment: Thoughtful

Narrator: But the thing about a lot of problems is that they're not a single prisoner's dilemma. Impalas see each other day after day and the same situation keeps happening over and over again.
[00:05:48] Sentiment: Insightful

Narrator: So that changes the problem because instead of playing the prisoner's dilemma just once, you're now playing it many, many times.
[00:05:54] Sentiment: Insightful

Narrator: And if I defect now, then my opponent will know that I'd defected and they can use that against me in the future.
[00:06:02] Sentiment: Insightful

Narrator: So what is the best strategy in this repeated game?
[00:06:10] Sentiment: Thoughtful

Narrator: That is what Robert Axelrod, a political scientist wanted to find out.
[00:06:18] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: So in 1980 he decided to hold a computer tournament.
[00:06:22] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: - He invited some of the world's leading game theorists for many different subjects to submit computer programs that would play each other.
[00:06:26] Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: - Axelrod called these programs strategies.
[00:06:34] Sentiment: Informative

- Narrator: The world's leading game theorists gathered for a tournament, submitting computer programs as strategies to play against each other. (Neutral)
- Axelrod called these programs strategies, with each facing off against every other and against a copy of itself in matchups lasting 200 rounds. (Neutral)
- Narrator: Axelrod used points instead of coins with the goal of winning as many points as possible over five repeated tournaments to ensure success was not a fluke. (Neutral)
- Narrator: Axelrod provided examples of strategies like one that cooperates initially but defects after two consecutive defections from its opponent. (Neutral)
- Narrator: Strategies like Friedman, Joss, and Graaskamp had unique approaches to playing the game. (Neutral)

[00:08:00] (Narrator) Graaskamp defects in the 50th round to probe the opponent's strategy, showing a strategic move.

[00:08:05] (Narrator) The most elaborate strategy was Name Withheld with 77 lines of code, demonstrating complexity in gameplay.

[00:08:21] (Narrator) The simplest program, Tit for Tat, surprisingly won the game, showcasing the power of a straightforward approach.

[00:08:28] (Derek) Tit for Tat cooperates initially and mirrors the opponent's last move, highlighting a reactive strategy.

[00:08:50] (Narrator) Tit for Tat's perfect cooperation with Friedman contrasts with its back-and-forth defections against Joss, illustrating different outcomes based on opponent behavior.

[00:09:05] (Speaker) The alternating defections between the programs reflect current political dynamics, drawing parallels to real-world conflicts.

[00:09:31] (Narrator) Mutual retaliations lead to a shift in gameplay dynamics, mirroring the consequences of retaliatory actions in politics and international relations.

[00:09:25] Speaker 1: "And that's also like some of the things that we're seeing in politics today and in international relations." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:09:31] Speaker 2: "As a result of these mutual retaliations, both Tit for Tat and Joss did poorly. But because Tit for Tat managed to cooperate with enough other strategies, it still won the tournament." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:09:43] Speaker 3: "As we are being joined..." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:09:46] Speaker 4: "Hey my God, there's Professor Axelrod." (Positive sentiment)

[00:09:50] Speaker 5: "Whoa, what a treat this is." (Positive sentiment)

[00:09:55] Speaker 6: "I imagine initially it'd be sort of like computer chess where you need a pretty complicated program to play a sophisticated game. But in fact it was not like that at all. It was the simplest strategy that did the best." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:10:08] Speaker 7: "Axelrod found that all the best performing strategies, including Tit for Tat, shared four qualities." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:10:15] Speaker 7: "First, they were all nice, which just means they are not the first to defect. So Tit for Tat is a nice strategy, it can defect but only in retaliation." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:10:25] Speaker 7: "The opposite of nice is nasty. That's a strategy that defects first. So Joss is nasty." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:10:37] Speaker 7: "The top eight strategies were all nice and even the worst performing nice strategy still far outscored the best performing nasty one." (Neutral sentiment)

[00:10:46] Speaker 7: "The second important quality was being forgiving. A forgiving strategy is one that can retaliate but it doesn't hold a grudge. So Tit for Tat is a forgiving strategy." (Neutral sentiment)

Speaker: 
[00:10:57] It retaliates when its opponent defects but it doesn't let affections from before the last round influence its current decisions. (Neutral)
[00:11:01] Friedman, on the other hand, is maximally unforgiving. (Negative)
[00:11:08] After the first defection just from the opponent, it would defect for the rest of the game. (Negative)
[00:11:14] Okay, that's it. No mercy and that might feel good to do but it doesn't end up working out well in the long run. (Negative)
[00:11:23] This conclusion that it pays to be nice and forgiving came as a shock to the experts. (Surprise)
[00:11:30] Many had tried to be tricky and create subtle nasty strategies to beat their opponent and eke out an advantage, but they all failed. (Negative)
[00:11:38] Instead, in this tournament, nice guys finished first. (Positive)
[00:11:41] Tit for Tat is quite forgiving, but it's possible to be even more forgiving. (Neutral)
[00:11:51] Axelrod's sample strategy only defects after its opponent defected twice in a row. It was Tit for Two Tats. (Neutral)
[00:11:56] Axelrod found that if anyone had submitted the Sample strategy, they would've won the tournament. (Positive)
[00:12:05] There are so many layers to this story, it's so clever. (Positive)
[00:12:15] After Axelrod published his analysis of what happened or circulated it among these game theorists, he said, now that we all know what worked well, let's try again. (Neutral)
[00:12:22] So he announced a second tournament where everything would be the same except for one change: the number of rounds per game. (Neutral)
[00:12:29] In the first tournament, each game lasted precisely 200 rounds. (Neutral)
[00:12:36] If you know when the last round is, then there's no reason to cooperate in that round. (Negative)

[00:12:29] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Each game lasted precisely 200 rounds.

[00:12:32] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
And that is important because if you know when the last round is,

[00:12:34] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
then there's no reason to cooperate in that round.

[00:12:36] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
So you're better off defecting.

[00:12:39] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Of course your opponent should reason the same

[00:12:41] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
and so they should also defect in the last round.

[00:12:46] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
But if you both anticipate defection in the last round,

[00:12:49] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
then there's no reason for you to cooperate in the second to last round or the round before that, or before that

[00:12:57] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
And so in Axelrod's tournament,

[00:13:00] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
it was a very important thing that the players didn't know exactly how long they were gonna be playing.

[00:13:04] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
They knew on average it would be 200 rounds, but there was a random number generator that prevented them from knowing with certainty.

[00:13:13] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
- Yeah, if you're not sure when it ends, then you have to kind of keep cooperating 'cause it might keep going and you might need them on your side.
- That's right.

[00:13:21] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
- For this second tournament, Axelrod received 62 entries

[00:13:29] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
and again, added random.

[00:13:33] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
This created two camps.

[00:13:35] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Some thought that clearly being nice and forgiving were winning qualities.

[00:13:42] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
So they submitted nice and forgiving strategies.

[00:13:48] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
The second camp anticipated that others would be nice and extra forgiving

[00:13:52] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
and therefore they submitted nasty strategies to try to take advantage of those that were extra forgiving.

[00:13:56] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
One such strategy was called Tester.

[00:13:50] Speaker: The speaker discusses how some strategies were submitted to take advantage of forgiving opponents. (Neutral)
[00:13:52] Speaker: Tester was a strategy that would defect initially to test the opponent's reaction. (Neutral)
[00:14:00] Speaker: If the opponent retaliated, Tester would switch to Tit for Tat, but if not, it would defect every other move. (Neutral)
[00:14:16] Speaker: Tit for Tat was found to be the most effective strategy once again. (Positive)
[00:14:21] Speaker: Nice strategies performed better overall in the top 15. (Positive)
[00:14:27] Speaker: Nasty strategies dominated the bottom 15. (Negative)
[00:14:36] Speaker: Axelrod identified retaliatory behavior as another key quality for successful strategies. (Neutral)
[00:14:43] Speaker: Requiring immediate retaliation against defection to avoid being taken advantage of. (Neutral)
[00:14:57] Speaker: The importance of clarity in strategies was highlighted by Axelrod. (Neutral)
[00:15:09] Speaker: Programs that were too opaque or random made it difficult to establish trust. (Neutral)
[00:15:27] Speaker: The complexity of game theory strategies and their impact is mind-blowing. (Positive)

00:15:21 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: Defaulting to thinking every turn is like the last time I'm gonna see you. (Neutral)

00:15:24 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: So I might as well defect. (Neutral)

00:15:27 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: Mind-blowing realization about the principles of being nice, forgiving, provokable, and clear resembling the morality of "an eye for an eye." (Positive)

00:15:40 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: Comparing the principles to the morality that has evolved around the world. (Positive)

00:15:57 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: Noting that Tit for Two Tats won the first tournament but ranked 24th in the second, showing that there is no single best strategy in the repeated prisoner's dilemma. (Neutral)

00:16:15 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: Highlighting that the best-performing strategy depends on the other strategies it interacts with in the repeated prisoner's dilemma. (Neutral)

00:16:24 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: Tit for Tat performs poorly when faced with always defecting strategies. (Negative)

00:16:51 - Speaker: Narrator
Statement: Successful strategies in a simulation see their numbers grow while unsuccessful ones go extinct, showcasing the dynamics of strategy evolution. (Positive)

[00:16:54] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Strategy in the top 15,
[00:16:56] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
first grew quickly,
[00:16:59] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
but then as the strategies it was preying on went extinct,
[00:17:03] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Harrington's numbers also quickly dropped.
[00:17:06] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
This shows a main benefit of this simulation because it tests how well a strategy does with other successful strategies.
[00:17:09] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
After a thousand generations, the proportions are mostly stable and only nice strategies survive.
[00:17:13] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
Again, Tit for Tat comes out on top, representing 14.5% of the total population.
[00:17:18] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
Now this process may sound similar to evolution, but there is a subtle difference, which is that in this case there are no mutations.
[00:17:29] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
So it's actually an ecological simulation.
[00:17:32] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
But what if the world you started in was different?
[00:17:39] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Imagine a world that is a really nasty place to live, more or less populated with players that always defect, except there's a little cluster of tit-for-tat players that live in some kind of nucleus and they get to play with each other a lot because they're geographically sequestered.
[00:17:48] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
They will start building up a lot of points, and also because that translates into offspring, they'll start to take over the population.
[00:17:59] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
So in fact, Axelrod showed that a little island of cooperation can emerge and spread and eventually will take over the world, which is fantastic.
[00:18:11] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
How can cooperation emerge in a population of players who are self-interested? Who are not trying to be good because they're good-hearted.
[00:18:19] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
You don't have to be altruistic. You could be looking out for number one for yourself and your own interests. And yet cooperation can still emerge.
[00:18:31] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
(bright music)

Speaker: Narrator

Sentiment: Informative

Narrator: For number one for yourself and your own interests. And yet cooperation can still emerge. Some argue that this could explain how we went from a world full of completely selfish organisms where every organism only cared about themselves to one where cooperation emerged and flourished. From impalas grooming each other to fish cleaning sharks. Many life forms experience conflicts similar to the prisoner's dilemma, but because they don't interact just once, both can be better off by cooperating. And this doesn't require trust or conscious thought either because the strategy could be encoded in DNA, as long as it performs better than the other strategies, it can take over a population. Axelrod's insights were applied to areas like evolutionary biology and international conflicts, but there was one aspect that his original tournaments didn't cover. What happens if there is a little bit of random error in the game? Some noise in the system. For example, one player tries to cooperate, but it comes across as a defection. Little errors like this happen in the real world all the time. Like in 1983, the Soviet satellite-based early warning system detected the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the US but the US hadn't launched anything. The Soviet system had confused sunlight reflecting off high altitude clouds with a ballistic missile. Thankfully, Stanislav Petrov, the Soviet officer on duty, dismissed the alarm. But this example shows the potential costs of a signal error and the importance of...

Speaker 1: [00:20:09] The Soviet officer on duty dismissed the alarm.
Speaker 1: [00:20:12] But this example shows the potential costs of a signal error and the importance of studying the effects of noise on those strategies. (Neutral)
Speaker 2: [00:20:20] The word game sounds like it's a children's game or, you know, there's something, a misnomer maybe in calling it game theory because this is, these are life and death matters obviously. (Neutral)
Speaker 2: [00:20:31] And as you mentioned that this came up in the Cold War. I mean it could actually be life and death of the whole planet, we could annihilate human civilization. (Neutral)
Speaker 2: [00:20:39] So these are not games in any kind of trivial sense, it's just the term that is used by mathematicians and theorists. (Neutral)
Speaker 1: [00:20:47] When Tit for Tat plays against itself in a noisy environment, both start off by cooperating, but if a single cooperation is perceived as a defection, then the other Tit for Tat retaliates and it sets off a chain of alternating retaliations. (Neutral)
Speaker 1: [00:21:08] Therefore, in the long run, both would only get a third of the points they would get in a perfect environment. Tit for Tat goes from performing very well to performing poorly. (Neutral)
Speaker 1: [00:21:19] So how do you solve this? Well, you need a reliable way to break out of these echo effects. (Neutral)
Speaker 1: [00:21:25] And one way to do this is by playing Tit for Tat, but with around 10% more forgiveness. (Neutral)
Speaker 1: [00:21:38] This helps you break out of those echoes while still being retaliatory enough. (Neutral)

- Speaker 1: "After every defection, you only retaliate around nine out of every 10 times." (Neutral)
- Speaker 1: "This helps you break out of those echoes while still being retaliatory enough to not be taken advantage of." (Positive)
- Speaker 2: "And so we also ran the tournament with noise and generosity, and that did quite well." (Positive)
- Speaker 2: "My favorite example is Tit for Tat does really well, but it could never do better than the player it's playing with." (Neutral)
- Speaker 2: "I mean, think about it, by design, all they can do is lose or draw." (Neutral)
- Speaker 2: "And yet when the results of all interactions are tallied up, they come out ahead of all other strategies." (Positive)
- Speaker 2: "Similarly, always defect can never lose a game. It can only draw or win, but overall, it performs extremely poorly." (Negative)
- Speaker 2: "This highlights a common misconception because for many people when they think about winning, they think they need to beat the other person." (Neutral)
- Speaker 2: "In games like chess or poker, this is true since one person's gain is necessarily another person's loss, so these games are zero sum." (Neutral)
- Speaker 2: "But most of life is not zero sum." (Neutral)
- Speaker 2: "To win, you don't need to get your reward from the other player. Instead, you can get it from the banker." (Positive)
- Speaker 2: "Only in real life, the banker is the world. It is literally everything around you. It is just up to us to find those win-win situations, and then work together to unlock those rewards." (Positive)
- Speaker 2: "Cooperation pays even among rivals." (Positive)
- Speaker 2: "From 1950 to 1986, the US and Soviet Union had trouble cooperating and both kept developing nukes. But then from the late '80s onwards, they started reducing their nuclear stockpiles. They too had learned how to resolve conflict." (Positive)

[00:23:15] Speaker: Narrator

Transcript: But then from the late '80s onwards, they started reducing their nuclear stockpiles.
