[00:00:00] Jim Sciutto: This is a rising major attack. (Urgent)

[00:00:12] Jim Sciutto: It's a major attack, Dana. (Serious)  
[00:00:16] Jim Sciutto: And it's an escalation. It's an escalation of this war. (Serious)

[00:00:27] Jim Sciutto: This attack, according to U.S. intelligence, principally or perhaps entirely ballistic missiles which are the fastest by far and the most dangerous. (Worried)  
[00:00:35] Jim Sciutto: Uh And now what we're seeing in addition to those intercepts is we're seeing fragments falling to the ground. (Concerned)
