Speaker 1: Thereâ€™s a war brewing between a handful of billionaires to seize control of AI. (Neutral)

Speaker 2: They want you to think their tech will make the world better for all of us. (Neutral)

Speaker 1: We dug into what they really want. (Neutral)

I want to say something that you would never expect to hear from More Perfect Union.

[00:00:05] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Elon Musk is right about something.

[00:00:07] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Elon Musk is suing the maker of ChatGPT, suing OpenAI for breach of contract by putting profit ahead of benefiting humanity.

[00:00:12] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Elon's lawsuit against OpenAI, the most recognized developer of artificial intelligence was big news.

[00:00:24] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Confused
But when I heard it, I was a bit confused. When has Elon ever been against profit?

[00:00:29] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
So I dug in. I read and I watched far too much of these guys talking about AI.

[00:00:36] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
I think that AI will be a technological revolution on the scale of the agricultural, the industrial, the computer revolution.

[00:00:43] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
AI is about to revolutionize digital biology and genomics and transportation and retail. Artificial intelligence... this is... it is a renaissance.

[00:00:58] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
By the time these lawsuits are decided, we'll have Digital God. Digital God.

[00:01:02] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
I noticed three things: that the rise of AI is inevitable, that it will change everything about our lives and that there is a war brewing between a handful of billionaires to seize control of it.

[00:01:18] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
NVIDIA became one of the most valuable stocks of all time, producing chips for AI.

[00:01:24] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
Microsoft reached an over $3 trillion valuation based on its AI work.

[00:01:30] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Positive
OpenAI tripled in value in just ten months.

[00:01:37] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
But where do we- You and I and everyone other than the dozen or so billionaires duking it out for control fit in?

[00:01:44] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
We're already seeing plans to replace human nurses with AI, media magnates killing jobs to focus on cost cutting with AI, AI written drivel filling the internet, and AI that does karaoke for you.

Speaker 1: "to replace human nurses with AI, media magnates killing jobs to focus on cost cutting with AI, AI written drivel filling the internet, and AI that does karaoke for you." (Negative sentiment towards AI replacing human jobs and its impact on the workforce)
Speaker 1: "Well, let's look at the possible AI future through the rise of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and just one contender in the billionaire battle for the future." (Neutral sentiment, introducing the topic of Sam Altman and AI's future)
Speaker 1: "Sam Altman is the ruler of Silicon Valley startups. And that's not me saying that, he thinks that." (Neutral sentiment, highlighting Sam Altman's influence in Silicon Valley)
Speaker 1: "I think the president of YC is sort of the unofficial leader of the startup movement. YC is YCombinator, a significant venture capital firm and tech incubator that Altman ran from 2014 to 2019." (Neutral sentiment, explaining Altman's role in YCombinator)
Speaker 1: "He originally connected with YC in 2008 when the firm funded his app Loopd when he was 19 years old and wore two popped collars. It was a common Silicon Valley story. They raised a ton of money gathering a bunch of data and got in trouble for texting everyone on your phone when you downloaded the app." (Neutral sentiment, narrating Altman's early startup experience)
Speaker 1: "Altman sold the company and it all but disappeared. Altman landed at YCombinator, where he rose to president in two years." (Neutral sentiment, discussing Altman's journey after selling his startup)
Speaker 1: "Under his leadership, YCombinator invested in massive companies most people have heard of like Reddit, Airbnb, Coinbase, Dropbox, Stripe, Twitch, DoorDash and Instacart." (Positive sentiment, highlighting Altman's successful investments at YCombinator)
Speaker 1: "In a lecture to Stanford computer science students on startups, Altman quoted Peter Thiel's advice: as Peter Thiel is going to discuss the fifth class. You want an idea that turns into a monopoly, but you can't get a monopoly in a big market right away. You have to find a small market in which you can get a monopoly and then quickly expand." (Neutral sentiment, discussing Altman's approach to startups)
Speaker 1: "Quick expansion is an inherent part of the way venture capital funded tech runs today." (Neutral sentiment, explaining the nature of venture capital funded tech)
Speaker 2: "This is Tim O'Reilly." (Neutral sentiment, introducing Tim O'Reilly as a new speaker)

Tim O'Reilly: Quick expansion is an inherent part of the way venture capital funded tech runs today. One of the big problems with today's Silicon Valley is that it no longer really supports free market competition. In the early days of VC, you were really talking about funding insurgent companies that had an experimental idea. Most companies didn't actually raise massive amounts of capital, but at some point that changed.

By 2010, in the wake of super low interest rates, there was all this cheap capital and companies were just buying market share. This led to what I call the Uber problem, where heavily capitalized companies were driving everybody else out of business by growing rapidly with a bunch of capital. Uber created an ecosystem where if you wanted a cab, you needed to use Uber, pushing out the old system of car services.

In 2015, OpenAI was announced as a nonprofit focused on air safety, funded and supported by Y Combinator, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Amazon, and Infosys. It was a new approach that raised eyebrows in the tech industry.

[00:05:14] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Funded and supported by Y Combinator.

[00:05:16] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman-the LinkedIn guy, Peter Thiel, Amazon and Infosys, basically a who's who of the people who built the broken tech infrastructure of today.

[00:05:29] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
The stated goal of OpenAI was to advance digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole with no shareholders to be beholden to.

[00:05:40] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
We wanted to build this with humanity's best interest at heart. That doesn't sound too bad, right?

[00:05:55] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
A groundbreaking new technology, its power available to all without any responsibility to shareholders. But let's dig a little deeper.

[00:06:04] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
They say they want to make the world better and do it safely. But what does that mean to them?

[00:06:24] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Well, Altman claims to have the answer in his essay, say Moore's Law for everything he explains.

[00:06:49] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Which sounds great. Maybe, but how true is that? When corporations see falling labor costs and reduce prices, or just keep the profits for themselves?

[00:07:00] Speaker: Narrator
Sentiment: Neutral
Would a flat tax and UBI mean more money for working people or more tax cheating by the rich in social service.

Speaker: Narrator

Sentiment: Critical

Narrator: Would a flat tax and UBI mean more money for working people or more tax cheating by the rich in social service cuts for everyone else? And there was a running theme through all of what Altman says: the inevitability and the danger of artificial intelligence. Listen to this clip. Altman benefits from the narrative that AI is this big, scary thing, even as they're the ones trying to build and profit from it. It feels a little bit like a kind of misdirection. They're basically calling for a kind of regulation of an extreme right to avoid the regulation of the many proximate harms we can see today. If they were really afraid of it, they would stop doing their research. Instead, they're racing to accelerate it so they get a monopoly. It's a lot like the famous line from The Wizard of Oz. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. And a lot of where I spent my time in talking about regulation is this. There is a man behind the curtain or a series of men who are making decisions for their business advantage. And those are the things that we need to be regulating. Why are they moving fast to break things? Altman says AI will probably lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there will be great companies created with serious machine learning. Companies- See, it's right back to profit. But hold on.

Speaker: Narrator

[00:08:31] Narrator: But in the meantime, there will be great companies created with serious machine learning. Companies-
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:08:37] Narrator: See, it's right back to profit.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:08:40] Narrator: But hold on. Isn't opening AI a nonprofit? Not anymore.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:08:48] Narrator: Just three years after the founding of Open A.I., they transition to something they're calling mixed profit.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:08:56] Narrator: We had tried and failed enough to raise the money as a nonprofit. We didn't see a path forward there.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:09:01] Narrator: So we needed some of the benefits of capitalism, but not too much.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:09:06] Narrator: And the new Board of OpenAI is rife with the profiteers who've been extracting value from working people for decades.
Sentiment: Negative

[00:09:14] Narrator: They're also not open. None of this stuff is just simply available. An old version of ChatGPT is free and kind of fun sometimes.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:09:24] Narrator: OpenAI's real product is enterprise software, doing partnerships with other giant tech companies and loads of stuff we don't even know about.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:09:40] Narrator: OpenAI has a product to sell, a product they see as having inevitable near universal proliferation, which is a pretty damn good business plan.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:09:48] Narrator: Tim O'Reilly said about the Uber problem. Here's how it applies to AI: all of the smaller AI firms are already starting to fall because there are a couple in the far of OpenAI and Anthropic that are incredibly heavily funded, that have tens of billions of dollars of capital.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:10:08] Narrator: We just know that they're the ones that big investors picked up early. And so we have a defective kind of a market where if you really believe in the wisdom of millions of people
Sentiment: Neutral

This chunk continues in the next part.

Investor: that big investors picked up early. (Neutral)
Speaker: And so we have a defective kind of a market where if you really believe in the wisdom of millions of people making independent decisions based on optimal information to kind of work this free magic market, we don't have that. (Neutral)
Speaker: And we have a central committee of deep-pocketed investors. (Neutral)
Speaker: It all illuminates Elon's lawsuit against OpenAI when he and Altman had once been such good friends. (Neutral)
Speaker: I'm looking for any video game play. Can you give me a recommendation? (Neutral)
Speaker: Overwatch for overwatch? (Neutral)
Speaker: Yeah. That's great. Um, I named it OpenAI after open source. (Neutral)
Speaker: It is, in fact, closed source. It should be renamed Super Closed Source for Maximum Profit AI. (Neutral)
Speaker: But he has his own for sale for profit AI that he wants to be predominant. (Neutral)
Speaker: He made it open source in a seemingly empty gesture. (Neutral)
Speaker: But meanwhile, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google all want to take control of the tech that will change our future and destroy our jobs. (Neutral)
Speaker: It doesn't matter that these guys say they're doing it for good. It matters what they are actually doing. (Neutral)
Speaker: Look at the dawn of the internet itself or web 2.0, that's social media and user-generated content. (Neutral)
Speaker: All of that seems great. And yeah, the modern Internet has obviously had a lot of clear benefits, but it was also pretty quickly ruined by giant corporations and profit motive. (Neutral)
Speaker: We're already starting to see effects of the power grab. (Neutral)
Speaker: Nvidia, the main producer of the chips used for the AI, is partnering with a company that wants to replace nurses with an AI that costs $9 an hour. (Negative)
Speaker: Look at anything from the history of the American medicine industry. Will a new low-cost tool actually help? (Neutral)

Nurse: "AI costs $9 an hour." (Neutral)
Narrator: "Look at the history of the American medicine industry." (Neutral)
Narrator: "Will a new low-cost tool actually help patients or just pad investor pockets?" (Neutral)
Narrator: "Companies using AI for job interviews are shutting out applicants unfairly." (Negative)
Narrator: "AI is generating content that makes the Internet more unusable." (Negative)
Narrator: "AI-generated LinkedIn comments are pointless." (Negative)
Narrator: "What are we going to do about this?" (Neutral)
Narrator: "Sam Altman suggests having more good guys than bad guys approach." (Positive)
Narrator: "We need more good guys to stand up against bad humans building AI systems." (Positive)
Narrator: "When electricity was first widespread, workers formed unions for safer jobs and better wages." (Positive)
Narrator: "The same concept applies to AI: remember the writers' strike?" (Neutral)

Speaker: Not specified

[00:13:33] Statement: We clearly have electricity today, right?
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:13:37] Statement: That same concept applies to AI: remember the writers strike?
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:13:41] Statement: The Screenwriters Guild stood up and said no to taking their jobs.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:13:47] Statement: Senator Bernie Sanders just introduced legislation for a shorter workweek.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:13:50] Statement: Do we continue the trend? The technology only benefits the people on top.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:13:55] Statement: Or do we demand that these transformational changes benefit working people?
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:14:01] Statement: And one of the benefits must be a lower workweek.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:14:06] Statement: If A.I. is going to make workers more productive and labor cheaper, workers should be able to take advantage of it. A.I. cannot exist without being trained on all that humanity has done before.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:14:20] Statement: That's literally how the way most people interact with A.I. was built by reading a bunch of stuff online and then synthesizing it so it can talk.
Sentiment: Neutral

[00:14:29] Statement: If all of this is built on the labor of all of humanity, then it should be all of humanity that benefits.
Sentiment: Neutral
