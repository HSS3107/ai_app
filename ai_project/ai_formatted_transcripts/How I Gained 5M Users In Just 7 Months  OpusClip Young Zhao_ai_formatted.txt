[00:00:00] Young Zhao: Welcome to today's talk on how I gained 5 million users in just seven months. (Excited)  
[00:01:02] Young Zhao: As an introvert-engineer, I always believed that technology could change the world. (Hopeful)  
[00:03:49] Young Zhao: The key to our rapid growth was understanding user needs and iterating quickly. (Positive)  
[00:09:35] Young Zhao: In this AI era, survival means adapting and innovating constantly. (Determined)  

*This chunk continues in the next part.*

[00:00:00] Young Zhao: So after three months of the launch, we only gathered about 200 users. (Neutral)  
[00:00:04] Young Zhao: However, only seven months after we launched the product, (Neutral)  
[00:00:07] Young Zhao: we see so many users saying like, I want to pay to jump over the queue (Positive)  
[00:00:10] Young Zhao: I want to pay to get a higher resolution. (Positive)  
[00:00:12] Young Zhao: I want to pay for more downloads, I want to pay for more credits. (Positive)  
[00:00:15] Young Zhao: And by the end of 2023, we had nearly 10 million ARR as well as 5 million user signups. (Positive)  
[00:00:21] Young Zhao: But for the live streaming tool, we didn't save any time. (Neutral)  
[00:00:23] Young Zhao: We didn't really help them make more money. (Neutral)  
[00:00:25] Young Zhao: If you can't make more money or save time for your users, (Neutral)  
[00:00:29] Young Zhao: they just feel like it's a cool product. (Neutral)  
[00:00:30] Young Zhao: It's cool from look and feel, but not from a business perspective. (Neutral)  
[00:00:34] Young Zhao: A product market fit is probably something that you see users are (Neutral)  
[00:00:38] Young Zhao: Hi, I'm Young, I'm the co-founder and the CEO at OpusClip, so we. (Neutral)  
[00:00:42] Young Zhao: OpusClip turns your long form video footage into social, engaging short video clips in just one click that saves about over 99% of your time and resources and expertise of social video production. (Positive)  
[00:00:56] Young Zhao: We've gathered user signups, supports and trust from over 5 million creators and businesses worldwide. (Positive)  
[00:01:07] Young Zhao: You can probably see that people who create social apps are really introverts. (Neutral)  
[00:01:11] Young Zhao: They can't socialize in real life in real person, so they have to figure out another hacky way to socialize with people. (Neutral)  
[00:01:18] Young Zhao: Especially, I want to socialize with people when I'm not sober. (Neutral)  
[00:01:21] Young Zhao: I co-founded a social app company that was called Sober. (Neutral)  
[00:01:24] Young Zhao: So the name you can tell is that after you drink, how you want to socialize with other people, right? (Neutral)  
[00:01:28] Young Zhao: We raised about $1.5 million back in 2013. (Positive)  
[00:01:32] Young Zhao: However, unluckily, that was just two months before Snapchat was launched. (Negative)  
[00:01:36] Young Zhao: We shared a very similar concept. (Neutral)

[00:01:28] Young Zhao: We raised about $1.5 million back in 2013. (Neutral)  
[00:01:32] Young Zhao: However, unluckily, that was just two months before Snapchat was launched. (Negative)  
[00:01:36] Young Zhao: We shared a very similar concept that all the friendship and all the content will disappear in a few seconds or in just a day. (Neutral)  
[00:01:42] Young Zhao: The company definitely failed after a year. (Negative)  
[00:01:44] Young Zhao: However, I really enjoyed being an entrepreneur through that experience. (Positive)  
[00:01:48] Young Zhao: I think in the early stage when people become an entrepreneur is probably driven by solving their own needs and trying to expand that solution to more people, right? (Neutral)  
[00:01:58] Young Zhao: I think people who want to be an entrepreneur in the early days, by nature, are people who want to impact more people, impact the society and impact the world. (Positive)  
[00:02:06] Young Zhao: So back in early 2015, I went to China with a couple other friends from Silicon Valley. (Neutral)  
[00:02:11] Young Zhao: At that time, the popular trend was to copy the successful business models from the US to China, and we discovered a pretty cool business model from Toast that helped restaurants speed up everything all the way from POS to MarTech to HR tech. (Neutral)  
[00:02:23] Young Zhao: However, it didn't really turn out well because of the completely different landscape and ecosystem. (Negative)  
[00:02:30] Young Zhao: But throughout the journey that we realized, we are actually the helper for the local restaurant and we should not only build a software, but also services whenever needed. (Positive)  
[00:02:39] Young Zhao: So I quickly formed a talent agency focused on Food Review, just actually four months after TikTok was launched. (Neutral)  
[00:02:45] Young Zhao: I know that short video can redefine how people market themselves, and we recognize the huge opportunity out there. (Positive)  
[00:02:51] Young Zhao: I spent about four years expanding that agency. (Neutral)  
[00:02:54] Young Zhao: We had about nearly 500 creatives in the team. (Neutral)  
[00:02:57] Young Zhao: After running the agency (Neutral)

[00:02:51] Young Zhao: I spent about four years expanding that agency. (Neutral)  
[00:02:54] Young Zhao: We had about nearly 500 creatives in the team. (Neutral)  
[00:02:57] Young Zhao: After running the agency for about four years, we realized that all the top talents left us because all of them want to be a solopreneur. (Slightly Negative)  
[00:03:05] Young Zhao: It is pretty easy and intuitive for a super creative person to become a solopreneur. (Neutral)  
[00:03:10] Young Zhao: They want to create content for themselves, not for some local restaurants. (Neutral)  
[00:03:14] Young Zhao: So I thought about it. (Neutral)  
[00:03:15] Young Zhao: Instead of managing these creatives directly in my team, why don't I build some AI powered product that can enable all of the creators? (Positive)  
[00:03:25] Young Zhao: There must be an AI solution that can automate as much as possible and remove the pain for creating contents. (Positive)  
[00:03:32] Young Zhao: Because I was running the business, I know how painful it is. (Slightly Negative)  
[00:03:35] Young Zhao: All the successful entrepreneurs have some sort of altruism. (Neutral)  
[00:03:38] Young Zhao: They want to help others. (Positive)  
[00:03:40] Young Zhao: It is pretty straightforward that they can get benefit. (Neutral)  
[00:03:43] Young Zhao: The benefit is not commercial. It's not business, but it's more spiritual benefit from helping others. (Positive)  
[00:03:55] Young Zhao: So the first product idea we came about is AI powered live streaming tool. (Neutral)  
[00:03:59] Young Zhao: So that was during the pandemic and everyone is working from home and watching live streaming content. (Neutral)  
[00:04:05] Young Zhao: So we founded the company back in January 2022. (Neutral)  
[00:04:08] Young Zhao: We spent about half a year building the live streaming product with all sorts of cool AI features like AI generated memes, AI populated interactions, and so on. (Positive)  
[00:04:18] Young Zhao: We realized that it is not solving any real pain points. (Negative)  
[00:04:22] Young Zhao: So after three months of the launch, we only gathered about 200 users. (Slightly Negative)  
[00:04:27] Young Zhao: So these 200 users, we actually spend a lot of effort. (Neutral)  
[00:04:30] Young Zhao: We want them to continuously use Opus Studio to give us feedback, but none of them is willing to do so. (Negative)

[00:04:27] Young Zhao: So these 200 users, (Neutral)  
[00:04:30] Young Zhao: We want them to continuously use Opus Studio to give us feedback, (Neutral)  
[00:04:35] Young Zhao: but none of them is willing to do so. (Negative)  
[00:04:37] Young Zhao: So we paid them like $20, $30 a session to use our product so that we can gather the feedback. (Neutral)  
[00:04:41] Young Zhao: But after we stopped paying for the stipend, none of them is continuously using the product. (Negative)  
[00:04:48] Young Zhao: However, the last feature we built for the AI powered live streaming product was a clipping feature because a lot of users keep asking us that after the live streaming, we want to repurpose the content so that we can reuse for distribution. (Neutral)  
[00:05:03] Young Zhao: So we added a feature that during your live streaming, you can hit the button and we will add a mark. (Neutral)  
[00:05:09] Young Zhao: And after the live streaming content is ready, we can deliver the clips for you directly. (Neutral)  
[00:05:14] Young Zhao: And also we use some other AI to recognize the cool moments. (Neutral)  
[00:05:18] Young Zhao: That was the only feature that these 200 users liked. (Positive)  
[00:05:22] Young Zhao: They say all the other stuff are nonsense. It doesn't help. (Negative)  
[00:05:26] Young Zhao: How can I only use this feature? (Neutral)  
[00:05:28] Young Zhao: So we decided to turn the feature into a standalone product. (Positive)  
[00:05:32] Young Zhao: And amazingly, in just two weeks, tens of thousands of users sign up for OpusClip (Positive)  
[00:05:37] Young Zhao: And by the end of 2023, we had nearly 10 million ARR, as well as 5 million user sign ups. (Positive)  
[00:05:40] Young Zhao: And that was only seven months after we launched the product. (Positive)  
[00:05:45] Young Zhao: The real product market fit comes from people who are really willing to pay for it. (Positive)  
[00:05:51] Young Zhao: When we launched Opus Studio, we asked the user during the interviews, like how much you want to pay for them and they're too shy to give us an answer. (Neutral)  
[00:05:59] Young Zhao: They were like, I will probably think about it or something like that, right? (Neutral)  
[00:06:04] Young Zhao: So you can know that they don't have any dedication or commitment. (Negative)

[00:05:59] Young Zhao: They were like, I will probably think about it or something like that, right? (Neutral)  
[00:06:04] Young Zhao: So you can know that they don't have any dedication or commitment to pay for the product, but for open clip, we see so many users saying like, (Neutral)  
[00:06:12] Young Zhao: I want to pay to jump over the queue. I want to pay to get a higher resolution. (Positive)  
[00:06:15] Young Zhao: I want to pay for more downloads, I want to pay for more credits. (Positive)  
[00:06:18] Young Zhao: We didn't have the payment setup on day one, but so many users just came in to knock on our door and email us and calling us even because we really saved tens of hours for them. (Positive)  
[00:06:29] Young Zhao: But for the live streaming tool, we didn't save any time. (Neutral)  
[00:06:31] Young Zhao: We didn't really help them make more money. (Neutral)  
[00:06:34] Young Zhao: If you can't make more money or save time for your users, (Neutral)  
[00:06:37] Young Zhao: they just feel like it's a cool product. (Neutral)  
[00:06:39] Young Zhao: It's cool from look and feel, but not from a business perspective. (Neutral)  
[00:06:43] Young Zhao: In the era of AI, there are definitely way more teams great at technologies, then teams great at building a product market fit. (Neutral)  
[00:06:53] Young Zhao: They believe they have a really strong technology through like a paper through academic research, but the user really want it. (Neutral)  
[00:06:59] Young Zhao: So I think definitely start with what the user wants, stay with your user, or even try to become a user. (Positive)  
[00:07:04] Young Zhao: And then think about whether your technology is the best solution, (Neutral)  
[00:07:09] Young Zhao: whether AI is the best solution. (Neutral)  
[00:07:11] Young Zhao: So many AI products that can deliver over 100% of quality at times, but also really under deliver really disappointed users. (Neutral)  
[00:07:19] Young Zhao: So I think from a user experience perspective, how you manage your user expectations is really tricky. (Neutral)  
[00:07:24] Young Zhao: Once AI delivers some results, can user touch up on that? (Neutral)  
[00:07:28] Young Zhao: So that's why we spend a lot of our resources building some manual features. (Neutral)  
[00:07:33] Young Zhao: That comes after the AI first approach. (Neutral)

[00:07:28] Young Zhao: So that's why we spend a lot of our resources building some manual features. (Neutral)  
[00:07:33] Young Zhao: That comes after the AI first approach, which means once I deliver the result, (Neutral)  
[00:07:37] Young Zhao: if the user thinks it's 80% perfect, they can still continue the workflow from what we generate for the user. (Neutral)  
[00:07:43] Young Zhao: This is going to really completely solve a user problem. (Positive)  
[00:07:47] Young Zhao: Because you are building a product, you are solving a business problem that eventually has to be 100% resolved. (Neutral)  
[00:07:53] Young Zhao: AI, if AI can only do 80%, you have to make sure the other 20% can be well handled by human hands. (Neutral)  
[00:08:00] Young Zhao: Right now at OpusClip we launch a new feature every single week. (Positive)  
[00:08:03] Young Zhao: That is one of our culture and that is one of the trends. (Neutral)  
[00:08:06] Young Zhao: Users love our product. (Positive)  
[00:08:08] Young Zhao: They see OpusClip not only as the current product, but how fast we iterate the market by launching new features every single week, (Positive)  
[00:08:15] Young Zhao: making sure you experiment extensively before launching an AI product. (Neutral)  
[00:08:21] Young Zhao: Because AI is not so controllable nowadays, the results can be versatile, (Neutral)  
[00:08:26] Young Zhao: can go beyond even your expectation. (Neutral)  
[00:08:29] Young Zhao: I see most of the AI features or AI products start with like a lab, start with a beta version, (Neutral)  
[00:08:36] Young Zhao: and after quite a few more months when it is really stable, when the cost really came down, then it becomes part of a core product. (Neutral)  
[00:08:41] Young Zhao: Don't spend too much time building an AI core product. (Neutral)  
[00:08:46] Young Zhao: Try to launch it separately, try to launch some small experiments, (Neutral)  
[00:08:50] Young Zhao: and get early users' feedback before cutting down the cost. (Neutral)  
[00:08:54] Young Zhao: Before integrating that into your main product. (Neutral)  
[00:08:57] Young Zhao: And our product is also very unique in terms of user feedback, (Neutral)  
[00:09:01] Young Zhao: is that the user not only directly gives us feedback through using the product, (Neutral)  
[00:09:05] Young Zhao: but also once they post a video from our product to the social medias, (Neutral)

[00:09:01] Young Zhao: In terms of user feedback, the user not only directly gives us feedback through using the product, (Neutral)  
[00:09:05] Young Zhao: but also once they post a video from our product to the social medias, (Neutral)  
[00:09:09] Young Zhao: we can gather the number of user views, the number of comments, number of favorites, and number of reshares. (Neutral)  
[00:09:15] Young Zhao: So all these, what we call audience feedback, is actually ten times or even 100 times more than our user direct feedback. (Neutral)  
[00:09:23] Young Zhao: And we're going to use these amount of feedback to fit into our model training, (Neutral)  
[00:09:27] Young Zhao: so that we can judge whether we are generating a good video clip even before the user publishes to the social media channels. (Neutral)  
[00:09:40] Young Zhao: So our vision is to enable anyone to become a creator without the effort and hassle of video editing and prompting skills. (Positive)  
[00:09:44] Young Zhao: We don't want an AI to remove the human authenticity. (Neutral)  
[00:09:52] Young Zhao: We want humans to focus and spend more time on creating an idea. (Positive)  
[00:09:56] Young Zhao: Create your script. (Neutral)  
[00:09:57] Young Zhao: Film the relevant contents and then we OpusClip will take over all the boring and tedious and time-consuming work. (Positive)  
[00:10:05] Young Zhao: So there are in general, from video production perspective, there are three major stages. (Neutral)  
[00:10:08] Young Zhao: The first one is pre-production, where you edit a topic, you write the scripts and you prepare the storyboard, (Neutral)  
[00:10:15] Young Zhao: and then it comes to the production where you film the content, you record the screen, or you prepare the media assets. (Neutral)  
[00:10:24] Young Zhao: The last one is the post-production, right where you edit the video, you assemble, you cut the scenes and you sequence them in order. (Neutral)  
[00:10:32] Young Zhao: Previously, most of the AI or technology is only focusing on a specific scene or a specific frame. (Neutral)  
[00:10:37] Young Zhao: But nowadays the overall story, the overall narration and the curation can be well enhanced and automated by AI. (Positive)  
[00:10:43] Young Zhao: The second thing is definitely... (Neutral)  

This chunk continues in the next part.

[00:10:37] Young Zhao: But nowadays the overall story, the overall narration and the curation can be well enhanced and automated by AI. (Neutral)  
[00:10:47] Young Zhao: The second thing is definitely the generative AI technologies. (Neutral)  
[00:10:49] Young Zhao: We can see that most of the time it's really hard to feel the content. (Neutral)  
[00:10:53] Young Zhao: But nowadays with Sora, with Pika, with other AI models, you can generate like a few seconds long footage or B-roll from just a few words. (Positive)  
[00:11:02] Young Zhao: So I think one is the understanding, the other is the generation. (Neutral)  
[00:11:07] Young Zhao: These two huge advancements of AI are actually automating the whole process and also generating new footage. (Neutral)  
[00:11:13] Young Zhao: I think with the advancement in these AI technologies, creators are actually shifting from creating content to being creative. (Positive)  
[00:11:23] Young Zhao: They don't have to spend so much time to specifically create each piece of content. (Neutral)  
[00:11:28] Young Zhao: I can do this job for them, but they should spend probably ten times more time to think about how to be creative. (Positive)  
[00:11:34] Young Zhao: Because everyone is being more and more creative. (Positive)  
[00:11:36] Young Zhao: Everyone has more time to be more creative. (Positive)  
[00:11:39] Young Zhao: Everyone has more resources to be more creative. (Positive)  
[00:11:41] Young Zhao: I think the paradigm shift is how can you be ten times tenfold more creative than before? (Neutral)  
[00:11:46] Young Zhao: I think in the AI era, being authentic and being genuine is probably going to be more of a rare find because it's easy. (Neutral)  
[00:11:56] Young Zhao: It's super easy to leverage AI to generate a lot of fabricated content. (Neutral)  
[00:12:00] Young Zhao: So my advice would be, just be yourself, be human, be real. (Positive)  
[00:12:05] Young Zhao: And, you know, maybe nowadays it's easy to be like that, but think about 5 or 10 years later when AI is everywhere, when AI generated content is everywhere. (Neutral)  
[00:12:14] Young Zhao: Like being super real, being super genuine and authentic is probably going to help you be the most creative. (Positive)
